{"article": "TEHRAN, Iran (CNN) -- Iran's parliament speaker has criticized U.S. President-elect Barack Obama for saying that Iran's development of a nuclear weapon is unacceptable.  Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has outlined where he thinks U.S. policy needs to change.  Ali Larijani said Saturday that Obama should apply his campaign message of change to U.S. dealings with Iran.  \"Obama must know that the change that he talks about is not simply a superficial changing of colors or tactics,\" Larijani said in comments carried by the semi-official Mehr News Agency.  \"What is expected is a change in strategy, not the repetition of objections to Iran's nuclear program, which will be taking a step in the wrong direction.\"  In his first post-election news conference Friday afternoon, Obama reiterated that he believes a nuclear-armed Iran would be \"unacceptable.\" He also said he would help mount an international effort to prevent it from happening.  Larijani said that U.S. behavior toward Iran \"will not change so simply\" but that Obama's election showed internal conditions in the United States have shifted.  He added that Iran does not mind if the United States provides other Persian Gulf countries with nuclear technology, but \"you should know that you cannot prevent the Islamic Republic [from reaching its goals in the nuclear field],\" according to the news agency.  Obama cautioned Friday that it had only been a few days since the election and that he was not in office.  \"Obviously, how we approach and deal with a country like Iran is not something that we should simply do in a knee-jerk fashion. I think we've got to think it through,\" Obama said.  \"But I have to reiterate once again that we only have one president at a time. And I want to be very careful that we are sending the right signals to the world as a whole that I am not the president, and I won't be until January 20th.\"  Larijani was speaking two days after Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad congratulated Obama, the first time an Iranian leader has offered such wishes to a U.S. president-elect since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.  One analyst said the welcome was a gesture from the hard-line president that he is open to a more conciliatory relationship with the United States.  Ahmadinejad said Tehran \"welcomes basic and fair changes in U.S. policies and conducts,\" according to the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency on Thursday.  Relations between the United States and Iran have historically been chilly and have been further strained in recent years over Iran's nuclear program.  Tehran insists that the program exists for peaceful purposes, but the United States and other Western nations are concerned by Iran's refusal to halt uranium enrichment activities.

{"article": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- Israeli military action in Gaza is comparable to that of German soldiers during the Holocaust, a Jewish UK lawmaker whose family suffered at the hands of the Nazis has claimed.  A protester confronts police in London last weekend at a demonstration against Israeli action in Gaza.  Gerald Kaufman, a member of the UK's ruling Labour Party, also called for an arms embargo on Israel, currently fighting militant Palestinian group Hamas, during the debate in the British parliament Thursday.  \"My grandmother was ill in bed when the Nazis came to her home town of Staszow. A German soldier shot her dead in her bed,\" said Kaufman, who added that he had friends and family in Israel and had been there \"more times than I can count.\"  \"My grandmother did not die to provide cover for Israeli soldiers murdering Palestinian grandmothers in Gaza.\"  Kaufman, a senior Labour politician who was raised as an Orthodox Jew, has often opposed Israeli policy throughout his career.  Israel has said it initiated the operation into Gaza -- which is controlled by Hamas -- to stop rocket fire on its southern cities and towns. Thirteen Israelis, including 10 soldiers, have died in the operation in Gaza and from rocket strikes on southern Israel, according to the Israeli military.  More than 1,000 Palestinians have been killed, including many civilians, Palestinian medics said.  During Thursday's debate, Kaufman also said that Israel needed to seek real peace and not peace by conquest, which would be impossible.  He also accused the Israeli government of \"ruthlessly and cynically exploiting the continuing guilt from gentiles over the slaughter of Jews in the Holocaust as justification for their murder of Palestinians.\"  But Kaufman added that while it is necessary to talk to Hamas, which had been chosen by an electorate, it nevertheless is a \"deeply nasty organization.\"  Bill Rammell, the Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, said the UK government backed an EU presidency statement calling Israeli action disproportionate. But he also criticized Hamas rocket attacks on Israel during the cease-fire between June and December 2008, adding that the militant group's \"whole ethos is one of violence\" and that it had \"made a brutal choice to step up attacks against innocent civilians.\"  \"Nothing, not the restrictions on Gaza nor its frustration with the peace process, justifies what Hamas has done and continues to do,\" Rammell said. \"In December, I was in Ashkelon near the Gaza border, and I heard the sirens. The fear was palpable: This is daily psychological and actual warfare.\"  Rammell added that Hamas has \"committed acts of terrorism, it is committed to the obliteration of the state of Israel, and its statement last week that it was legitimate to kill Jewish children anywhere in the world was utterly chilling and beyond any kind of civilised, humanitarian norm.\"  The debate came on the day that Saeed Siam, Hamas' third-ranking leader in the territory, was killed by an Israeli airstrike, the Islamic militant group reported.  The United Nations' main relief compound in the territory was also hit and set on fire, which U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon blamed on Israel.  Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert expressed sorrow over the incident but said Israeli forces were responding to militant fire near the complex.  UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown described the shelling of the compound  as \"indefensible,\" media agencies reported.  Speaking to Ban during a call, Brown said the UK would increase its calls for a cease-fire and also deliver aid to Gaza once a cease-fire took hold.  Britain has witnessed several demonstrations since the conflict in Gaza began late last month.  Last Saturday, up to 20,000 people gathered outside the Israeli Embassy in London, Metropolitan Police said.  Later, parts of the crowd began pelting officers with sticks, rocks and pieces of metal barriers, police said. A similar protest Sunday was peaceful.

{"article": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- There are no immediate plans to commit more U.S. troops to the ongoing war in Afghanistan, President Obama said Wednesday.  Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, left, and President Obama meet in Washington on Wednesday.  Speaking to reporters alongside Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, Obama said he would consult with U.S. allies before determining a strategy in Afghanistan after last month's elections there.  \"I'm going to take a very deliberate process in making those decisions,\" Obama said. \"There is no immediate decision pending on resources, because one of the things that I'm absolutely clear about is you have to get the strategy right and then make a determination about resources.\"  The United States has about 62,000 U.S. troops in the country, and NATO allies -- including Canada -- have another 35,000. The Pentagon is planning to add 6,000 troops by the end of the year.  There have been indications that Obama soon could be asked to commit even more American troops. Defense Secretary Robert Gates, however, has signaled he would like to gauge the impact of the 6,000-troop increase before considering whether to send more.  Support in the United States for the war in Afghanistan has dipped to an all-time low. Just 39 percent of Americans favor the war, while 58 percent oppose it, according to a national CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey released Tuesday.  Recent polling suggests that the increasing violence and slow pace of progress are also taking a toll on support for the war in Canada.  Obama thanked Harper for his country's commitment to Afghanistan, where more than 2,800 Canadian troops and dozens of civilians are stationed.  \"They have fought; they have had staying power; they have absorbed losses that we all grieve for,\" he said.  Watch Obama and Harper meet \u00bb  Most of the Canadian forces are based in the southern Kandahar province, home to some of the worst violence and instability. At least 130 Canadian troops have been killed in the war.  Last year, after a national debate, the Canadian government extended the mission -- which was to end this February -- until the end of 2011.  Harper said Wednesday that \"Canada is not leaving Afghanistan\" but is \"transitioning from a predominately military mission to a mission that will be a civilian humanitarian mission after 2011.\"  The two leaders also discussed economic issues, issuing a joint statement after their meeting saying in part that \"open trade and investment are essential for competitiveness and sustainable growth in North America and globally.\"  Obama acknowledged that the \"Buy American\" clause in the economic stimulus package has been a \"source of irritation\" between Canada and the United States and is something Harper has repeatedly brought to his attention.  The clause is a provision in the $787 billion stimulus package enacted in February that states only American goods can be used in stimulus projects. But it stipulates that the measure would not override existing U.S. trade treaties such as the North American Free Trade Agreement.  Harper said Canada's concerns about the clause are \"important irritants... but relatively small\" when compared with the overall U.S.-Canadian trade relationship.", "Q": ["Q: Who said there is no immediate plans for deployment?

{"article": "LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Former detainees of Immigration and Customs Enforcement accuse the agency in a lawsuit of forcibly injecting them with psychotropic drugs while trying to shuttle them out of the country during their deportation.  Raymond Soeoth, pictured here with his wife, says he was injected with drugs by ICE agents against his will.  One of the drugs in question is the potent anti-psychotic drug Haldol, which is often used to treat schizophrenia or other mental illnesses. Doctors say they are required to see patients in person before such drugs are administered.  Two immigrants, Raymond Soeoth of Indonesia and Amadou Diouf of Senegal in West Africa, told CNN they were injected with the drugs against their will.  Both are plaintiffs in a class-action lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union against the government. They are seeking an end to the alleged practice and unspecified damages.  Watch why the former detainees claim abuse \u00bb  Dr. Paul Appelbaum, a professor of psychiatry, law and ethics at Columbia University, reviewed both men's medical records for this report and was stunned by what he discovered.  \"I'm really shocked to find out that the government has been using physicians and using potent medications in this way,\" said Appelbaum, who also serves as a member of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law.  \"That is the sort of thing that would be subject to a malpractice claim in the civilian world.\"  The allegations of ICE forcibly drugging deportees were raised last month by Sen. Joe Lieberman, I-Connecticut, during the re-nomination hearing of ICE chief Julie Myers.  \"The information the committee has received from ICE regarding the forced drugging of immigration detainees is extremely troubling, particularly since it appears ICE may have violated its own detention standards,\" Lieberman spokeswoman Leslie Phillips told CNN in an e-mail.  \"Senator Lieberman intends to follow up with ICE to ensure that detainees are not drugged unless there is a medical reason to do so.\"  ACLU attorney Ahilan Arulanantham, who is representing Soeoth and Diouf, said, \"It would be torture to give a powerful anti-psychotic drug to somebody who isn't even mentally ill.... But here, it's happening on U.S. soil to an immigrant the government is trying to deport.\"  Responding to Lieberman's written questions, Myers said 1,073 immigration detainees had \"medical escorts\" for deportation since 2003.  From October last year to the end of April this year, she said 56 received psychotropic medications during the removal process. Of those, 33 detainees received medication \"because of combative behavior with the imminent risk of danger to others and/or self,\" she said.  \"First, I am aware of, and deeply concerned about reports that past practices may not have conformed to ICE detention standards,\" Myers said.  She added no detainee should be \"involuntarily medicated without court order,\" except in emergency situations.  But both Soeoth and Diouf say they had not exhibited any combative behavior.  Soeoth, a Christian minister from Indonesia, spent 27 months in detention awaiting deportation after his bid for political asylum was rejected. Hours before he was to be sent back home on December 7, 2004, he says guards injected him with a mystery drug that made him groggy for two days. See the document that shows Soeoth was injected  \"They pushed me on the bench, they opened my pants, and they just give me injection,\" he said through broken English.  He says he was taken to Los Angeles International Airport while in this drug-induced stupor, but two hours before takeoff, airline security refused to transport him, so ICE agents returned him to his cell at Terminal Island near Los Angeles. Terminal Island, once a federal prison, is a crowded facility along the ocean where hundreds of illegal immigrants await deportation.  Soeoth's medical records indicate he was injected with Cogentin and Haldol, even though those same records show he has no history of mental illness.  In the records, the government says he was injected with the drug after he said he would kill himself if deported -- a remark Soeoth denies ever making.  ICE said in a written statement it couldn't respond to specific allegations due to pending litigation.  \"Department of Homeland Security law enforcement personnel may not and do not prescribe or administer medication to detainees,\" the ICE statement said. \"Only trained and qualified medical professionals, including officers of the U.S. Public Health Service, may prescribe or administer medication.\"  But, Diouf says, he was injected on the plane right before he was to be deported. He said he even had a federal stay of his deportation -- and the paperwork to prove it -- but his U.S. government escorts wouldn't let him show it to the pilot of the plane preparing to fly him out of the country. See Diouf's stay of deportation document  That's when, he says, \"I was wrestled to the ground and injected through my clothes.\"  A government report says he was medicated because he did not follow orders.  In both cases, Diouf and Soeoth remain in the United States pending a decision in the case. If they lose, they may land back in the hands of ICE, once again facing deportation.  Soeoth says he's traumatized by what happened. \"I know this country [is] very generous to immigrants,\" he says. \"What they did to me was very, very bad.\" E-mail to a friend  CNN's Wayne Drash, Traci Tamura and Gregg Cane contributed to this report.", "Q": ["Q: Will Lieberman investigate further?

{"article": " -- A Colorado prosecutor Friday asked a judge to dismiss the first-degree murder charge against Tim Masters, who spent nine years in prison until new DNA evidence indicated someone else might have committed the crime.  Tim Masters, center, walks out of a Fort Collins, Colorado, courthouse Tuesday with his attorney David Wymore.  Court papers filed by District Attorney Larry Abrahamson cited \"newly discovered\" evidence, but took pains to state that evidence didn't clear Masters.  \"While the newly discovered DNA evidence does not exonerate Timothy Masters, it clearly warrants a complete re-examination of all the evidence related to the murder of Peggy Hettrick,\" the court papers state.  The motion seeks dismissal of the charges \"in the interest of justice.\" It points out the DNA testing used to uncover the new evidence wasn't available when Masters was investigated and tried.  On Tuesday a judge threw out Masters' 1999 murder conviction, and he was freed -- also \"in the interest of justice.\"  Although the motion signals that Abrahamson is dropping the Masters case, he did not rule out future prosecution.  In a statement, the prosecutor cautioned: \"Contrary to news reports, the DNA testing results only suggest that there may be others, along with Timothy Masters, who should be investigated. These test results do not provide us with enough information to completely exonerate anyone.\"  Abrahamson said he has asked Colorado Attorney General John Suthers to appoint a special prosecutor to continue the investigation of Hettrick's slaying.  The attorney general will announce his decision early next week, Abrahamson said.  Masters, 36, has been investigated for Hettrick's  murder since he was 15. He has insisted he had nothing to do with her death, and no physical evidence ties him directly to the crime.  Watch Masters describe his anger at police \u00bb  A jury convicted Masters 12 years after the discovery of Hettrick's stabbed and sexually mutilated corpse in a field near his trailer.  Among the evidence jurors considered were a collection of knives found in Master's bedroom, gruesome sketches and testimony from a prosecution expert that he fit the psychological profile of a killer.  Masters' defense team said he was framed, and that police and prosecutors sat on evidence that could have raised doubt about his guilt.  The significance of Friday's motion to dismiss is largely procedural, but Abrahamson indicated earlier this week that it might be unnecessary to try Masters again.  \"In light of newly discovered evidence revealed to me on Friday,\" Abrahamson said in a statement a week ago, \"I will be moving as expeditiously as possible to make the determination of whether all charges against Timothy Masters will be dismissed.\"  Abrahamson also has vowed to review all \"contested convictions\" in which advances in DNA testing may prove useful.  He said he wanted to examine the legal discovery process and that he had met with the Fort Collins police chief and his officers \"to discuss the critical flow of information with assurance that all information is available to our office and the defense.\"  Special prosecutor Don Quick filed a motion earlier this month citing four instances in which police and prosecutors should have handed over evidence to Masters' original defense team.  See the key players in the case \u00bb  Among them was a police interview with a plastic surgeon who said it was improbable that a teen could have made the meticulous cuts necessary to remove Hettrick's body parts.  Also, according to Quick's motion, police failed to divulge that a renowned FBI profiler warned police that Masters' penchant for doodling gruesome horror scenes did not tie him to the crime.

{"article": " -- Women in Somalia's third-largest city, Baidoa, have been ordered to wear Islamic dress starting this week or face jail time, according to a resident and Somali media reports.  Somali women wait to get medicine at a clinic near Mogadishu in July.  The order -- issued last week by Al-Shabaab, the radical Islamist militia that controls the city -- also warns business owners to close their shops during daily prayers, or they will be temporarily shut down, a local journalist said.  The militia has ordered women to cover their bodies and heads from view, according to a resident of Baidoa who did not want to be identified for security reasons. The clothing must be black, red or white, and women in the impoverished city are concerned that they will not be able to purchase clothing that conforms to the order, the resident said.  He said women would be jailed if they violated the order after it goes into effect Tuesday. Somalia's Shabelle Media, quoting an Al-Shabaab spokesman, said they would spend 12 hours in jail.  Shabelle points out that it is unclear how Al-Shabaab will enforce its order in Baidoa. The militia has issued similar edicts that failed to be carried out, according to Shabelle.  But this edict could be bolstered by Somalia's parliament, which voted unanimously Saturday to allow sharia, or Islamic law, in the Horn of Africa country. Lawmakers hope to boost President Sharif Ahmed's efforts to defeat Al-Shabaab, which has vowed to fight the government until sharia is imposed in Somalia.  Somali Prime Minister Omar Abdirashid Ali Sharmarke told Voice of America that parliament's vote \"removed any justifications for any opposition group... to use Islam for political ends.\"  There are concerns that Islamic law, which has numerous interpretations and variations, could lead to government-sanctioned human rights abuses in Somalia. The strict interpretation of sharia forbids girls from attending school, requires veils for women and beards for men, and bans music and television.  Last week, Al-Shabaab fighters patrolling the streets shot and killed a 20-year-old Somali man because he was not praying at the designated time, according to a local journalist who cannot be named for security reasons.  Sharmarke denied that the vote would open the door for a radical interpretation of Islamic law, such as that carried out by the Taliban in Afghanistan.  \"People always think of the Taliban and Talibanization of a country. But that isn't the case,\" the prime minister said. \"I think sharia in Somalia is part of the laws for thousands of years, and we never had this kind of a thing. Besides, it doesn't have to be that way, cutting hands.\"  Under some strict interpretations of sharia, a thief is punished by having a hand cut off.  Al-Shabaab was once the armed wing of the Islamic Courts Union, which took over most of southern Somalia in the second half of 2006. The United States says the group is affiliated with the al Qaeda terrorist network, and it backed an Ethiopian invasion that drove the ICU from power in 2006.

{"article": "(Mental Floss) -- If you think comic book characters do amazing things in comic books, you won't believe what they can do off the page.  For starters, Superman brought down the Ku Klux Klan, and Donald Duck raised ships from the ocean floor.  1. Superman defeats the Ku Klux Klan  In the 1940s, \"The Adventures of Superman\" was a radio sensation. Kids across the country huddled around their sets as the Man of Steel leapt off the page and over the airwaves. Although Superman had been fighting crime in print since 1938, the weekly audio episodes fleshed out his storyline even further.  It was on the radio that Superman first faced kryptonite, met The Daily Planet reporter Jimmy Olsen, and became associated with \"truth, justice, and the American way.\" So, it's no wonder that when a young writer and activist named Stetson Kennedy decided to expose the secrets of the Ku Klux Klan, he looked to a certain superhero for inspiration.  In the post-World War II era, the Klan experienced a huge resurgence. Its membership was skyrocketing, and its political influence was increasing, so Kennedy went undercover to infiltrate the group. By regularly attending meetings, he became privy to the organization's secrets.  But when he took the information to local authorities, they had little interest in using it. The Klan had become so powerful and intimidating that police were hesitant to build a case against them.  Struggling to make use of his findings, Kennedy approached the writers of the Superman radio serial. It was perfect timing. With the war over and the Nazis no longer a threat, the producers were looking for a new villain for Superman to fight. The KKK was a great fit for the role.  In a 16-episode series titled \"Clan of the Fiery Cross,\" the writers pitted the Man of Steel against the men in white hoods. As the storyline progressed, the shows exposed many of the KKK's most guarded secrets.  By revealing everything from code words to rituals, the program completely stripped the Klan of its mystique. Within two weeks of the broadcast, KKK recruitment was down. And by 1948, people were showing up to Klan rallies just to mock them.  Mental Floss: 5 memorable moments in comic book censorship  2. Donald Duck's scientific breakthrough  In 1966, Danish engineer Karl Kr\u00f8yer developed a method for raising sunken ships off the ocean floor by injecting them with polystyrene foam balls. However, when Kr\u00f8yer tried to license his invention with the Dutch patent office, he was denied. Donald Duck had beaten him to the punch by 22 years.  Indeed, Kr\u00f8yer's concept could be traced back to a Donald Duck comic conceived by Carl Barks. In addition to being the most celebrated artist of the Donald Duck comics, Barks was known for his scientific prowess.  So in a 1944 story, when Donald got a bump on his head that turned him into a genius, the duck managed to mumble, \"If I mix CH2 [a methylene compound] with NH4 [ammonium] and boil the atoms in osmotic fog, I should get speckled nitrogen!\"  Although it sounded like nonsense, it wasn't. In 1963, chemists P.P. Gaspar and G.S. Hammond wrote a technical article about methylene that included a reference to the Donald Duck story.  The final paragraph read, \"Among experiments which have not, to our knowledge, been carried out as yet is one of a most intriguing nature suggested in the literature of no less than 19 years ago.\"  A footnote revealed that \"literature\" as the Donald Duck comic. It seems the web-footed children's hero had deduced the chemical intermediate long before it had been proven to exist.  Mental Floss: Musicians performing on Sesame Street  But why were these top American chemists looking to comics for inspiration? Apparently, Dr. Gaspar had been a lifelong Donald Duck fan, and he'd rediscovered Donald's early reference to methylene while collecting old copies of the classic adventures.  Gaspar never disclosed how much his work owed to Duckburg's most famous resident, but then again, how many scientists would confess that they used comic books to bolster their research?  3. A Spider-Man villain keeps folks out of jail  In a 1977 edition of Spider-Man, Peter Parker has the tables turned on him. The villain, Kingpin, tracks down Spidey using an electronic transmitter that he'd fastened to the superhero's wrist. Although Kingpin loses in the end (he always does), one New Mexico judge saw beauty in his plan.  Inspired by the strip, Judge Jack Love turned to computer salesman Michael Goss and asked if he could create a similar device to keep track of crime suspects awaiting trial.  In 1983, Goss produced his first batch of electronic monitors. Authorities in Albuquerque then tested the devices on five offenders, using the gadgets as an alternative to incarceration.  Today, the transmitters are a common sight in courtrooms across the country, usually in the form of electronic ankle bracelets. Most famously, Martha Stewart donned one while she was under house arrest in 2004. Perhaps she would have felt better knowing that the gadget had once nabbed Spider-Man, too.  Mental Floss: Truth about lie detectors (and Wonder Woman)  4. Captain Marvel Jr. saves the bad-hair day  Like most American kids in the 1940s, Elvis Presley fantasized about growing up to be like his favorite comic book superheroes. But it turns out that The King might have been more interested in their fashion statements than their special powers.  During his early teen years, Elvis was obsessed with Captain Marvel Jr., known as \"America's most famous boy hero.\" A younger version of Captain Marvel, the character sported an unusual hairstyle that featured a curly tuft of hair falling over the side of his forehead.  Sound familiar? When Elvis set out to conquer America with his rock 'n' roll ways, he copied the 'do, thus making it one of the most famous hairstyles of the 20th century.  But that wasn't all. Captain Marvel also gets credit for the short capes Elvis wore on the back of his jumpsuits, as well as The King's famous TCB logo, which bears a striking resemblance to Marvel's lightning bolt insignia.  Of course, Elvis never tried to hide his love for the Captain. A copy of Captain Marvel Jr. No. 51 still sits in his preserved childhood bedroom in an apartment in Memphis, and his full comics collection remains intact in the attic at Graceland.  Plus, the admiration was mutual. Captain Marvel Jr. paid tribute to The King in one issue, referring to the singer as \"the greatest modern-day philosopher.\"  For more mental_floss articles, visit mentalfloss.com.", "Q": ["Q: Who did Superman battle in \"Clan of the Fiery Cross\"?

{"article": " -- It was just after midday on a cold December Monday in South Korea's capital when news of Kim Jong Il's death filtered through.  Though the reclusive North Korean leader had been plagued with health problems in recent years, the announcement was greeted with general astonishment in Seoul, according to a journalist from the country's largest newspaper.  \"The initial reaction was shock, quickly followed by speculation about what was going to happen next,\" said Woosuk Ken Choi, assistant editor with The Chosun Daily.  For its part, the South Korean military responded by raising its alert level, while the country's media went into overdrive trying to predict how this oblique and erratic state would respond.  But Choi said most ordinary Koreans were remaining calm.  North Korea: Should we fear change?  \"There was no rush to supermarkets to buy up food,\" he said in an interview with CNN. \"The South Korean public seems confident that the country will be able to manage this. Many see the North Koreans as like us, people we need to care for and help.\"  Outright conflict is not something many would expect, he added.  \"There is a little tradition in Korea that when someone passes away in a family you stop fighting.  \"We're on high alert not because we want to do something but because some renegade North Korean unit might cause some trouble. But no one really thinks the North Koreans will launch an attack.  \"Nothing happened in 1994 when Kim Il Sung died and it will be the same this time.\"  The architect of what became known as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in 1948 after the Korean peninsula was divided between U.S. and Soviet occupation forces, Kim Il Sung was an autocratic leader who presided over a policy of Juche, or self-reliance, which did much to foster the Communist country's isolation.  When Kim Jong Il, his oldest son, succeeded him, North Korea was crippled economically, having lost one of its main trading partners when the Soviet Union collapsed. Kim largely ignored the massive problems at home and focused on shoring up the regime's position and investing in the military as a bulwark against the wealthy, U.S.-backed south.  What military hardware does North Korea have?  But with Kim dead, Choi believes many in the south will see this as an opportunity to improve relations with their dysfunctional neighbor, perhaps even paving the way for reunification.  \"Most people, whether left or right on the political spectrum, hope this is the case,\" he said.  \"However a large chunk of South Koreans do worry about the financial burden of reunification, citing the case of West and East Germany in the early 1990s.  \"Others argue the cost of living together will be a lot less than living separately in the long run. I also believe a whole host of issues could be resolved with reunification.\"  But Choi said each generation in South Korea has its own viewpoint when it comes to relations with the north.  \"Those in their teens and 20s have a real fear of military conflict, as they are the ones who have to complete their compulsory military service,\" he said.  \"Many people in their 30s and 40s worry about the financial cost to them of reunification, while those in their 50s and 60s back a united Korea whatever the cost.\"  If reunification is a pipe dream for now, Choi says there is a difference of opinion in South Korea about the dynastic succession in the north.  \"Many people believe the transfer of power to a third generation is absurd, totally anachronistic and not what the world is about today,\" he said.  \"But those who believe in a policy of engagement with North Korea say it doesn't matter whether it is third or fourth generation, they're still our people and we need to talk to them to try and resolve the situation.\"  Another view, according to Choi, is \"the Great Successor\" will not last long.  \"He's simply too young,\" he said. Kim Jong Un is believed to be in his late 20s.  \"There is this notion in Korean society -- north and south -- that if you take the throne too young you won't last long. No matter how good he is, they think his uncles and more experienced family members will rule from behind him and that he could ultimately be sacrificed.\"  As pictures of ordinary North Koreans mourning the loss of their Dear Leader continued to filter onto television screens across South Korea Tuesday, Choi felt most people would have been struck by how staged they seemed.  \"The pictures don't reflect the reality in North Korea,\" he argued.  \"When Kim Il Sung died there were a number of people who really went out and cried because they really did respect him.  \"Kim Jong Il's case is different because about two or three million people died of starvation after he came to power. The level of mourning will be about a tenth of what it was in 1994. This is the view of many defectors I have spoken to.\"", "Q": ["Q: Who was greeted in Seoul? A:", "Q: What happened in 1994?

{"article": " -- Dr. Rajiv Shah President Obama announced Wednesday that Shah, the 36-year-old administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development, will be in charge of the overall U.S. relief effort in Haiti. \"The goal of the relief effort in the first 72 hours will be very focused on saving lives,\" Shah said.  At Shah's USAID swearing-in ceremony on January 7, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said, \"One only needs to ask his wife, Shivam, the lengths to which Raj will go to achieve important goals. After all, this is a man who flew to India for one day to propose to her at the Taj Mahal when she was traveling there alone. This is also a man who summited the 14,400-foot Mount Rainier -- one of the most difficult climbs in the continental United States, and it combines the challenges of an unforgiving glacier with the unpredictability of an active volcano. That may be the best preparation Raj has for working in Washington these days.\"  According to his USAID biography, Shah, a medical doctor and health economist, was an under-secretary at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Prior to joining the Obama administration, Shah served as director of agricultural development at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.  In 2001, Shah was the health care policy adviser on the Gore 2000 presidential campaign and a member of Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell's transition committee on health. In addition, he has served as a policy aide in the British Parliament and worked at the World Health Organization.  USAid.gov: Biography of Dr. Rajiv Shah  US State Department: Swearing-In Ceremony of Dr. Rajiv Shah  Jimmy Jean-Louis The Haitian native and cast member of the TV series \"Heroes\" was searching for his elderly parents in Haiti on Wednesday afternoon. Jean-Louis learned that a house he had grown up in had collapsed, killing several of his relatives.  \"I have not slept yet. The second house that I grew up in was down, and some relatives have died, from what I have been told,\" Jean-Louis said yesterday. \"I haven't been able to reach my parents. I have heard that they are OK, but I do not know what is going on around them.\"  Jean-Louis was born in Petionville, Haiti, where he grew up without electricity or running water. He moved to Paris, France, when he was 12 to pursue a modeling career and had supported his parents by sending money home since he started acting nearly 20 years ago. He is the founder of Hollywood Unites for Haiti, a nonprofit organization whose original mission was to provide sports and cultural education to underprivileged youth on the island. The group is now mobilizing for disaster relief.  CNN: 'Heroes' actor searching for parents after earthquake  Pat Robertson The evangelical Christian, who once suggested God was punishing Americans with Hurricane Katrina, says a \"pact to the devil\" brought on the devastating earthquake in Haiti.  Officials fear more than 100,000 people have died as a result of Tuesday's 7.0-magnitude earthquake in Haiti. Robertson, the host of the \"700 Club,\" blamed the tragedy on something that \"happened a long time ago in Haiti, and people might not want to talk about it.\" The Haitians \"were under the heel of the French. You know, Napoleon III and whatever,\" Robertson said on his broadcast Wednesday.  \"And they got together and swore a pact to the devil. They said, 'We will serve you if you will get us free from the French.' True story. And so, the devil said, 'OK, it's a deal.' \" Native Haitians defeated French colonists in 1804 and declared independence.  CNN: Pat Robertson says Haiti paying for 'pact to the devil'  Martha Coakley and Scott Brown With less than a week to go until a special Senate election in Massachusetts, the state's airwaves are packed with campaign ads as Democrat Martha Coakley and Republican Scott Brown battle to fill the last three years of the late Sen. Ted Kennedy's term.  Groups outside of the state are supporting the two candidates to the tune of millions of dollars. Brown is hoping to become the first Massachusetts Republican to win a U.S. Senate seat since 1972. Independent Joseph Kennedy, a third party candidate who is not related to the late senator, is also in the race.  The Boston Globe endorsed Coakley on Wednesday, saying the state's current attorney general is more qualified to serve in Washington than her Republican opponent. Brown, a state senator, \"believes in a culture of family, patriotism and freedom\" and \"is a proud member of the Massachusetts National Guard, where he has served for nearly three decades and currently holds the rank of Lt. Colonel in the Judge Advocate Generals (JAG) Corps,\" according to his Web site.

He was 59.  Pendergrass, known for smash-hit love ballads such as \"Turn Off the Lights\" and \"Love TKO,\" died after a long illness, according to Lisa Barbaris, who described herself as a close friend and his last publicist. His family did not reveal details about his illness, but said it was related to complications from a 1982 car accident, Barbaris said.  The crooner, affectionately known as just \"Teddy\" by many fans, started in music with a group called the Cadillacs in the late 1960s and was still with the group when it merged with Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes, according to his official Web site. He began as a drummer, but soon became the lead singer after the group heard his powerful voice. In 1972, Pendergrass' baritone could be heard on the classic Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes song \"If You Don't Know Me by Now.\"  After going solo, Pendergrass received several Grammy nominations, Billboard's 1977 Pop Album New Artist Award, and an American Music Award for best R&B performer of 1978, Barbaris said. In 1982, Pendergrass was involved in a car accident that left him paralyzed. But he returned to the studio in 1984 in his wheelchair to record an album. Before his death, Pendergrass was working on a musical documenting his life, called \"I Am Who I Am.\"  CNN: R&B singer Teddy Pendergrass dies at 59  What makes a person intriguing?  There are people who enter the news cycle every day because their actions or decisions are new, important or different. Others are in the news because they are the ones those decisions affect. And there are a number of people who are so famous or controversial that anything they say or do becomes news.  Some of these people do what we expect of them: They run for office, pass legislation, start a business, get hired or fired, commit a crime, make an arrest, get in accidents, hit a home run, overthrow a government, fight wars, sue an opponent, put out fires, prepare for hurricanes and cavort with people other than their spouses. They do make news, but the action is usually more important than who is involved in the story.  But every day, there are a number of people who become fascinating to us -- by virtue of their character, how they reached their decision, how they behaved under pressure or because of the remarkable circumstances surrounding the event they are involved in.  They arouse our curiosity. We hear about them and want to know more. What they have done or said stimulates conversations across the country. At times, there is even a mystery about them. What they have done may be unique, heroic, cowardly or ghastly, but they capture our imaginations. We want to know what makes them tick, why they believe what they do, and why they did what they did. They intrigue us.", "Q": ["Q: Where did the deadly earthquake happen? A:", "Q: Where did he lead the effort? A:", "Q: What did he say? A:", "Q: Who is blamed for bringing on the deadly earthquake?

{"article": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- After a week when he could not be traced, Egyptian striker Amir Zaki is back at his Premier League club side Wigan Athletic in northern England.  Wigan and Egypt striker Amir Zaki has mended relations with his club manager.  According to Wigan manager Steve Bruce the two have patched up their differences after he launched a verbal tirade against the 26-year-old striker.  Zaki told Al-Hayat TV that the pair \"ended up laughing\" about his absence -- when he failed to return from international duty and had a hamstring strain which no one knew the seriousness of.  But, it wasn't all laughs a week ago.  On Wigan's club Web site, Bruce had said of Zaki: \"I just feel it's time that we went public on just what a nightmare he has been to deal with. I can honestly say that in all my time in football I have never worked with someone as unprofessional.  \"I have already fined him the maximum allowed but this just seems to have no effect,\" Bruce said.  After giving Zaki a fine for his misdemeanor the Wigan manager also revealed it was the fourth time he had gone AWOL after international duty.  Are players selling their fans and clubs short when they go AWOL? How do you think should they be punished by clubs?  Zaki's case certainly isn't the first high profile instance of a player going missing.  Inter Milan striker Adriano sparked kidnap fears after failing to return earlier this month, following a World Cup qualifier in South America. It was not the first time the Brazilian had failed to report back to his club following international duty.  After a two-week absence, Adriano later announced he was taking a break from professional football at a news conference in Brazil.  He told reporters: \"I've lost the happiness of playing. I wouldn't like to go back to Italy, I want to live in peace here in Brazil.  \"I don't know if I'm going to stay for one, two or three months without playing. I'm going to rethink my career.\"  Other notable cases include Nigerian forward Ayegbeni Yakubu, who failed to return to club duty at Premier League side Everton after the African Cup of Nations last year.  When he returned to Everton,Yakubu was hit with a maximum \u00a380,000 fine. Manager David Moyes said at a news conference at the time: 'Yakubu's back in it now. That episode has ended. He let us down by not coming back. But it's over and we've moved on.\"  German club Schalke fined defender Rafinha a record $1million for making an unauthorized trip to the Beijing Olympic Games and spending a total of 35 days away.

England international Steven Gerrard was cleared by a court in Liverpool of affray.  The jury at Liverpool Crown Court took a little over an hour to clear Gerrard of charges relating to a fracas in a nightclub bar in the north-western of England city on December 29 of last year.  They accepted the Liverpool captain's version that he acted in self defense in punching businessman Marcus McGhee.  The 29-year-old was the only one of the seven defendants in the case to be cleared after an incident which was described by judge Henry Globe as an \"explosion of violence.\"  Gerrard spoke of his relief outside the court.  \"Can I just say how pleased I am with today's verdict,\" he said.  \"I'm glad to put this case behind me and I am really looking forward to the season ahead and concentrating on my football now.  \"I would just like to say a big thank you to my legal team and to my friends and family and everyone at Liverpool football club for supporting me.\"  His comments were met with a round of applause from a large group of fans of the Premier League club who had gathered outside the court, before he was ushered away.  Gerrard was celebrating in the Lounge Inn in Southport, a suburb of Liverpool, after scoring twice his team's 5-1 win at Newcastle which took them to the top of the Premier League.  Video footage, which was available to the court, showed the moment around 2.am in the morning when trouble flared.  Gerrard apparently wanted to change the music on the CD player and the 34-year-old McGee said the football star had acted aggressively in trying to grab the device.  In the fracas which followed, Gerrard admitted throwing three punches but said only one connected.  He claimed, and his version was accepted by the jury, that he believed he was about to be attacked himself.  \"You did not start the violence, it was started by the violent elbowing of Marcus McGee in the face by one of your friends, John Doran,\" Globe said.  \"The victim's consequential actions of reeling backwards and then forwards and your actions in response to that movement forward has to be seen against that background,\" he added.

{"article": "ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN)  -- Prosecutors will seek the death penalty against three men accused in connection with the July death of former boxing champion Vernon Forrest, officials said Tuesday.  Former boxing champion Vernon Forrest, 38, was shot and killed in southwest Atlanta, Georgia, on July 25.  A grand jury indicted the three suspects -- Charman Sinkfield, 30; Demario Ware, 20; and Jquante Crews, 25 -- on charges including murder, felony murder, aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, Fulton County Superior Court spokesman Don Plummer said in a statement.  Forrest, 38, was shot and killed in southwest Atlanta on July 25. He had stopped at a gas station to put air in his tire, Plummer said, and was robbed at gunpoint of his championship ring and Rolex watch.  \"Forrest chased the robber, believed to be Demario Ware, and then lost sight of him as he escaped into a nearby public housing complex,\" Plummer said. \"Forrest then encountered the accused triggerman, Charman Sinkfield, not far from the scene of the armed robbery. As he turned to walk away from the man, Forrest was shot seven times.\"  Crews is accused of being the getaway driver, Plummer said.  Forrest was the International Boxing Federation welterweight champion in 2001, the World Boxing Council welterweight champion in 2002-03, and the WBC light welterweight champion in 2007-08 and 2008-09, according to the BoxRec Web site. He was named the World Boxing Hall of Fame fighter of the year in 2002, the Web site said.  A $17,000 reward has been offered for the return of the watch and ring, Plummer said.

Watch as iReporter witnesses the clashes  Thirty-five cars and 160 trash containers also had been set ablaze, he said.  See images of anarchy on Greek streets \u00c2\u00bb  Demonstrators Monday barricaded streets in Athens and Thessaloniki and hurled gasoline bombs as they battled with police. Clouds of tear gas hung over the capital city as riot police continued to battle the hundreds of young self-styled anarchists rioting over the boy's death.  \"Rage is what I feel for what has happened, rage, and that this cop who did it must see what it is to kill a kid and to destroy a life,\" a student in Athens told reporters Monday.  Watch protesters clash with police \u00c2\u00bb  In a nationally televised address broadcast on state television, Greek Prime Minister Kostas Karamanlis condemned the violence and promised to punish those responsible for Saturday's shooting.  He also announced a decision to drop plans to reimburse business owners affected by the rioting.  The police officer who fired the fatal shot has been charged with \"manslaughter with intent\" and suspended from duty, police said, adding that a second police officer was arrested Saturday on criminal accessory charges.  Government officials have condemned the shooting.  \"An investigation is under way and those found responsible will be punished,\" said Pavlopoulos. \"Measures will also be taken to avoid such incidents again in the future.\" iReport.com: Are you there? Share photos, video of rioting  On Monday, authorities conducted an autopsy on the teenage boy in an effort to answer questions about the circumstances of the shooting, but the boy's family has called in their own investigators to verify state findings, the Athens coroner told CNN.  The U.S. and British embassies issued warnings to employees and tourists on Sunday, instructing them to avoid downtown Athens and other major cities until rioting subsides.  Tourists in central Athens hotels were advised by hotel staff not to leave their rooms as police fanned out across the city.  \"There are lots of burning bins and debris in the street and a huge amount of tear gas in the air, which we got choked with on the way back to our hotel,\" according to Joel Brown, a CNN senior press officer visiting Athens on Sunday.  A police statement about the teenage boy's death said the incident started when six young protesters pelted a police patrol car with stones. The teen was shot as he tried to throw a petrol bomb at the officers, police said.  Other angry teens converged on the site almost immediately.  Fighting between youths and police erupted elsewhere, including Thessaloniki, the country's second-largest city. Hundreds of young people took to the streets of the sprawling port city, finally barricading themselves behind the gates of a state university.  Authorities have been barred from entering university grounds since tanks crushed a 1973 student uprising protesting the ruling military junta. It was not clear what authorities would do about the demonstrators still holed up at the university.  No deaths have been reported since Saturday.  Police said Monday that 20 protesters had been rounded up for questioning.  Journalist Anthee Carassava in Athens contributed to this report.", "Q": ["Q: Where was the teenage boy shot?

{"article": "Peppermint oil, soluble fiber, and antispasmodic drugs can indeed help people with irritable bowel syndrome, according to an analysis of 25 years of research on the condition, which is characterized by bouts of diarrhea and constipation.  \"It wasn't appreciated how much of an impact [IBS] can have on a patient's quality of life,\" says one researcher.  About 10 to 15 percent of people in North America have IBS, and it's twice as common in women. However, only about one-third of people with the intestinal disorder seek treatment.  The exact cause of IBS remains unknown, and that lack of knowledge has led to the use of a variety of treatments, including fiber supplements, probiotics, antidepressants, behavioral-based therapies, psychotherapy, food modification, acupuncture, and laxatives. However, many treatments are controversial because study results have been mixed.  Newer and more expensive medications have been introduced to the public, but some were ineffective or withdrawn from the market due to side effects. The recent study sheds light on the cheap and readily available treatments that can help patients, says study coauthor Eamonn M. Quigley, M.D., a professor of medicine and physiology at University College Cork in Ireland.  \"Medical science has tended to ignore IBS; it wasn't appreciated how much of an impact it can have on a patient's quality of life,\" he says. Health.com: Is that belly ache in your head?  In the new analysis, researchers systematically reviewed 38 studies from the last 25 years; more than 2,500 volunteers were involved. That research compared therapies -- all relatively cheap, safe, and readily available -- with a placebo or with no treatment at all.  The team looked at three treatments -- soluble fiber, peppermint oil, and antispasmodics, which are drugs that relax the smooth muscle in the gut and relieve cramping -- and found that they were all more effective than a placebo, according to the report in the British Medical Journal.  But not all fiber is the same. The soluble fiber ispaghula husk, which is also known as psyllium and found in some bulk laxatives, significantly reduced symptoms of  IBS, particularly constipation; insoluble fiber, such as bran, did not relieve symptoms.  Several antispasmodic drugs helped prevent IBS symptoms, particularly diarrhea. The most effective one was hyoscine, which is sold without a prescription in the United States.  Although peppermint oil was found to be the most effective of the three therapies, more data are needed, cautions Quigley. The peppermint-oil therapy was analyzed in only four trials involving 392 patients.  Because past research has been mixed, doctors' treatment guidelines mention the remedies, but don't necessarily give them a ringing endorsement, says author Alex Ford, M.D., a registrar of gastroenterology at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario.  \"I suspect that filters down to the practitioners who don't believe they work, so they try something that's newer or a bit sexier,\" Dr. Ford says. \"The problem with IBS is that it's a chronic medical condition and no drug has been shown to alter its natural history.\" Health.com: Should I be tested for IBS?  The study results are not surprising, says Joanne A.P. Wilson, M.D., a professor of medicine in the gastroenterology department at Duke University Medical Center in Durham, North Carolina.  Dr. Wilson adds that such treatments are best for patients with mild or moderate IBS. However, in her practice, she's found that prescription medications need to be used for severe cases that don't respond to these treatments. Health.com: Belly flab doubles mortality risk  Prescription drugs that have been used to treat IBS include Amitiza, a drug for chronic constipation; Zelnorm, which was pulled from the market in 2007; and Lotronex, which was removed from the market because of potentially life-threatening side effects (although exceptions are now made for women with severe, diarrhea-prominent IBS who don't respond to other treatments).

{"article": " -- Australia is asking an international court to weigh in on Japan's whale-hunting practices, officials said Tuesday.  Japanese officials say their hunts are permitted under rules prohibit commercial whaling but allow whaling for scientific reasons.  But Australian officials said they've filed a lawsuit with the International Court of Justice in The Hague, Netherlands, to stop Japan from exploiting the research loophole.  \"We believe that it's possible to do all the research that you need to do and understand everything that you need to... and you don't have to kill them to do it,\" Australian Environment Minister Peter Garrett told CNN Tuesday.  Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hidenobu Sobashima said Tuesday that Japan's whaling, which has killed up to 1,000 whales in Antarctic waters annually, is authorized.  \"Japan's research whaling is a legal activity,\" he said, noting that the country would continue to explain its perspective in international court.  The move toward legal action is \"regrettable,\" Sobashima said, when international whale-hunting rules are still being negotiated.  The International Whaling Commission is scheduled to evaluate existing whaling rules at its annual meeting in June.  But Garrett said diplomatic negotiations over the issues have not produced results. He stressed that taking the case to court does not mean that the relationship between Australia and Japan -- strong allies and trading partners -- has soured.  \"We think we can disagree about one thing and continue to have close relationships across a range of other issues,\" he said.  Japan's whaling has drawn sharp criticism from environmental advocacy groups, who claim it involves the cruel slaughter of whales so that meat can be sold in markets and restaurants.  Japan's fisheries agency has said that it wants \"sustainable whaling\" and also advocates conservation.  \"Clearly, the acceptance of other cultures' dietary practices and the promotion of cultural diversity is as important as saving endangered species and the promotion of biological diversity,\" the agency's website says. \"If the consumption of whale meat does not endanger whale species, those who find the practice unacceptable for themselves should not try to impose their view on others.\"  Australia's lawsuit comes as an anti-whaling activist was facing charges including assault and trespassing in a Japanese court.  Prosecutors allege that Peter Bethune, an environmental activist from New Zealand, threw butyric acid at a whaling ship, jumped aboard and attempted to make a citizen's arrest of the captain.  Bethune has pleaded guilty to all charges accept assault. He testified Monday that he did not intend to hurt anyone. A verdict is expected later this month.

{"article": "BERLIN, Germany (CNN) -- Jeffrey Jamaleldine took a bullet to his chin that blew out much of his jaw and nearly killed him while deployed in Iraq last year. The sacrifice is just part of his job, he says, and he'd go back to Iraq in a second if asked.  Jeffrey Jamaleldine left Germany for college in America. In 2006, he joined the U.S. Army.  That is something that troubles his family, especially his father. Jamaleldine served in the U.S. Army as a German citizen, one of an estimated 20,500 \"green-card warriors\" in the military.  Last month, Jamaleldine was awarded U.S. citizenship, but he's keeping his German passport.  Bashir Jamaleldine says his son is fighting an unjust war for an America that went too far when it invaded Iraq five years ago -- a sentiment shared by the majority of Germans. He wishes his son would get back to his \"German roots.\"  \"It would satisfy me more. Why he's more American than a German, I don't know,\" he says.  Of his son's time in Iraq, the father says, \"He went there to receive this bullet. If he would not have gone there, he wouldn't have been wounded; he wouldn't be in the hospital; he wouldn't be treated by a doctor. He would be living in peace with his family.\"  Shaking his head with his son at his side, he adds, \"He is more American than German.\"  Jeffrey Jamaleldine, a 31-year-old U.S. Army scout who proudly wears a Stetson hat and spurs on his boots, laughs. He says he and his dad have had countless arguments over his decision to join the U.S. military, but the two never budge from their positions.  See his shattered jaw and debate with his dad \u00bb  \"He hears what I'm saying, but there's just no coming through,\" he says.  The father came to Germany from Africa years ago. He says his son should be devoting his energy to fighting hunger and poverty in Africa, not fighting in Iraq.  The son agrees with his father on one thing: His love for America is unwavering. Jeffrey Jamaleldine moved to the United States to go to college in Missouri at the age of 18 and immediately fell in love with the United States and its culture.  \"You can go from rags to riches there. People still believe in that. It is not something that has gotten lost,\" he says.  And when the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, happened, he felt it was time for him to do something.  \"A small group of people [terrorists] -- I felt -- had a big influence on our way of life and that literally pissed me off,\" he says.  By accident, he says he found out that with his green card, he could join the U.S. military. And in 2006, he did just that. Read why a \"green-card\" Marine would die for America  Last year, he paid a heavy price for his patriotism. Pinned down in a firefight with insurgents in the Iraqi city of Ramadi, Jamaleldine was shot in the face.  \"I felt like I got hit by Mike Tyson,\" he says, pointing to a two-inch long scar on his left cheek.  The left side his jaw was shattered and now doctors at Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany are reconstructing his facial bones.  \"Part of the projectile is still stuck in the right cheekbone,\" Dr. Edward Vanisky says. \"But if it doesn't cause you any problems, we'll just leave it in there.\"  While many Americans would consider Jamaleldine a hero, most in his home country don't. Germans largely oppose the Iraq war. The criticism doesn't bother him.  Watch why a German would fight for U.S. \u00bb  He says even after getting wounded on the battlefield, he would go fight for America again if ordered back to Iraq.  \"I still don't want to die, I love life, I enjoy life,\" he says. \"But I would still make the sacrifice to go to Iraq again if I am called. If I have to go, I will -- to stand up for what I believe in,\" he says.  His father looks on in disbelief as he listens to his son, now an American citizen. But Jeffrey Jamaleldine says joining the military was never about that, it was about defending American ideals.  \"If we have people who want to change those ideals or take them away,\" he says, \"then there are people like me or my platoon who stand up and fight for those ideals.\" E-mail to a friend.", "Q": ["Q: Jeffrey Jamaleldine's dad wonders why his son is more \"American than German\" A:", "Q: What is his name?

{"article": " -- Three years ago, the film based on Dan Brown's novel \"The Da Vinci Code\" was the focus of protest and controversy, with a Vatican archbishop calling for a boycott and Catholics at many levels refuting plot points.  From left, actors Tom Hanks, Ayelet Zurer and Ewan McGregor join director Ron Howard at the film's premier.  But when it comes to the new film based on a Brown novel, \"Angels & Demons,\" star Tom Hanks says talk of controversy is much ado about nothing.  \"Everybody is looking for some scandal whether a scandal exists or not,\" Hanks said of the film. \"I think a kind of natural reaction is now that somehow because it's the second Robert Langdon mystery that there is some degree of controversy over it. And there is really not.\"  The movie ventures into similar waters as its predecessor, \"The Da Vinci Code,\" with Hanks reprising the role of Robert Langdon, a Harvard symbology expert, and conspiracy theories galore.  Watch Hanks talk aboout the controversy \u00bb  It also reunites the Academy Award-winning actor with director Ron Howard, who helmed \"Da Vinci,\" and teams Hanks with actor Ewan McGregor and Israeli actress Ayelet Zurer.  While \"The Da Vinci Code\" centered on the complex investigation of a murder in the Louvre and the theory that a marriage between Jesus and Mary Magdalene produced descendants, the new film features a murder at the Vatican and a secret and powerful society known as the \"Illuminati.\"  McGregor,  known for his role as a young Obi-Wan Kenobi in the \"Star Wars\" films, said that while \"The Da Vinci Code\" and \"Angels & Demons\" are inextricably linked, the latter can stand on its own.  \"If I thought [Angels & Demons] was pinned to 'The Da Vinci Code' in some way then it would've been a lesser script to read and it wasn't,\" McGregor said. \"It's a standalone movie... it's not relevant whether you've seen 'Da Vinci Code' or not.\"  Both films, like the Brown novels they're based on, have been met with criticism for their melding of history and storytelling.  \"I have a strong objection to the genre of mixing fact with fiction,\" said Bill Donohue, president of the Catholic League. \"You've got [Dan] Brown, [Ron] Howard and [Tom] Hanks in the movie all alleging that the Illuminati was this secret society which was brutalized by the Catholic Church in the 1600s.\"  \"It's all a lie,\" Donohue said. \"[The Illuminati] never even existed until May 1, 1776, but they have to pitch it back into the 1600s so they can trot out their favorite victim, Galileo. What happens is you get the audience thinking 'Well, maybe it's not all true, but probably some of it is true.' \"  Ted Baehr, founder of Movieguide and the Christian Film & Television Commission, first issued an advisory alert about the film in April and reiterated it days before the movie's May 15 release.  \"Now that we've previewed 'Angels & Demons,' Movieguide has decided to keep in effect our caution alert,\" Baehr said. \"Faith is often denied throughout the movie.\"  Director Howard wrote in the The Huffington Post that he believes Donohue is on a mission \"to paint me and the movie I directed, 'Angels & Demons,' as anti-Catholic,\" a claim Howard emphatically denies.  The director told CNN that he attempted to reach out to the Catholic Church regarding the film, but had no success. He also downplayed reports that Rome and the Vatican tried to hinder filming.  Hanks said shooting the movie in the ancient city was complicated given the vibrancy of Rome. At one point, Hanks said, make-believe collided with one woman's fairy tale.  \"We had a lady showing up who was getting married at the Pantheon and she had to get married and we had to get our shot,\" Hanks said. \"She showed up right between shots, when we were moving cameras.\"  Fortunately, both the wedding and the day's filming were able to be completed, Hanks said.  McGregor said Howard was to be credited for how well the production came together. Howard's background as an actor undoubtedly helped enhance the actors' performances, McGregor said.  \"A lot of directors are able to tell you what they're after, but Ron's able to tell you what he's after and help you for how you might play that... which is kind of total directing,\" McGregor said.  Zurer said she had a blast being the only female lead in the film.  Viewers should see the film for what it is, she said, and not focus on the controversy.  \"It's fun fiction,\" she said. \"It's a fun movie to watch, it's thrilling and that's what I saw in it.\"  CNN's Lisa Respers France contributed to this story.", "Q": ["Q: Who stars in \"The Da Vinci Code\"?

Today, violence is at the lowest level since March of 2004,\" he said. \"As a result of this progress, some of our troops are coming home, as a result of our policy called 'Return on Success.' We welcome them home.\"  White Houses spokeswoman Dana Perino called the bill a victory for the president.  \"Because we have seen success in the surge, perhaps Congress decided that it was OK to allow the commander in chief to be able to move forward as he saw fit,\" said Perino, noting the $162 billion was the same amount that the president had requested.  The supplemental spending bill also contains a new GI Bill that expands education benefits for veterans who have served since the 9/11 attacks, provides a 13-week extension of unemployment benefits and more than $2 billion in disaster assistance for parts of the Midwest that have been hit by record floods.  The signing comes two weeks before the deadline that Defense Secretary Robert Gates had established for the funds. Gates said he would consider laying off Defense Department employees to balance the Pentagon's books if legislation was not signed by July 15.  Watch a progress report from the U.S. ambassador to Iraq \u00bb  House Democrats had tried to include restrictions on war funding when they drafted the bill, but they were unable to overcome procedural hurdles that Republicans put up.  A compromise version of the supplemental bill was later negotiated between Democratic and Republican leaders that included the war funding along with the GI Bill, unemployment benefits and disaster relief -- three top legislative priorities for the Democrats that Bush and congressional Republicans originally resisted.  \"At a time when 2 million men and women have fought in Iraq and Afghanistan and when our troops have had to endure multiple deployments, stop-loss policies, insufficient equipment and an unclear strategy, giving them the opportunity to fuel our future economy is the least we can do,\" Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, said of the GI Bill after the Senate sent it to the president's desk Thursday night.  Congressional Democrats regained control of the House of Representatives and Senate after the 2006 midterm elections in large part to due to displeasure over the Iraq war.  But Democrats -- lacking the 60 votes to overcome GOP filibusters in the Senate, let alone the two-thirds majorities in both the House and Senate to override a presidential veto -- have been unable to pass significant restrictions on war funding because Republicans, for the most part, have stuck with Bush on the war.", "Q": ["Q: What is a supplemental spending bill A:", "Q: Who is the president?

{"article": " -- For actress Kyra Sedgwick, it's the public's approval that makes it worth being away from her family for six months to tape her critically acclaimed series \"The Closer.\"  Kyra Sedgwick and her husband, Kevin Bacon, at the 66th annual Golden Globe Awards this month.  But she may be getting more approval from her peers, too.  Sedgwick will walk the red carpet again Sunday night at the Screen Actors Guild Awards, where she is nominated for a fourth consecutive year for outstanding performance by a female actor in a drama series for her role as Deputy Chief Brenda Johnson. She's also won a Golden Globe for her performance, in 2007.  The TNT series resumes Monday night where it left off in September with what Sedgwick called \"a fantastic five episodes.\" (TNT is a unit of Time Warner, as is CNN.)  \"I said to the writers, 'I really want a lot of personal stuff for Brenda,' \" Sedgwick said. \"I feel like there's some of those personal quiet moments with her alone, is something that I've been missing as an actor, and I feel like the audience has been missing, too.  \"She is such a complicated, fascinating character, and watching her growth and lack of growth is something that is really interesting,\" she said.  When CNN asked whether the new episodes might include a wedding for her character, Sedgwick laughed.  \"That might very well happen,\" she said. \"That's pretty insightful of you. I'm just going to just say that.\"  A marriage for Brenda Johnson would be \"a complicated, difficult situation,\" she said, because \"she's basically married to her work.\"  Sedgwick's job also complicates her real-life marriage to Bacon, since the show is produced in Los Angeles and the couple lives in Connecticut with their two children.  That's where the approval -- whether on the street from fans or at award shows -- has \"been a wonderful phenomenon for me,\" she said.  \"On a personal level, that's really good for me, because I really miss my family when I'm working on the show six months in L.A.,\" she said. \"As much as I try to get my kids to move to L.A. and my husband, they just wouldn't have it.  \"It's challenging, and I'm glad that people are watching, because otherwise it would be kind of hard to go to work,\" Sedgwick said.  Sedgwick has moved into an executive producer's role on the show, which she said she expects to continue for at least two more years.  \"I love being with a group where there's not a power struggle,\" she said. \"I have a lot of say, and I always have.

{"article": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- U.S. officials are downplaying any imminent threat of a North Korean missile strike or confrontation between the two countries at sea.  A U.S. official says North Korean leader Kim Jong Il seems to be \"testing the new administration.\"  The U.S. intelligence community does not believe North Korea intends to launch a long-range missile in the near future, a U.S. intelligence official told CNN, despite reports in Japanese media citing intelligence that the North Korean regime intends to fire a missile toward Hawaii on July 4.  Shortly after that report, Defense Secretary Robert Gates said he was deploying defensive measures around Hawaii.  But a recent warning to mariners issued by North Korea suggests the country only intends short- and medium-range missile tests, according to one U.S. intelligence official.  The North Korean government issued a warning to mariners to avoid an area in the Sea of Japan at certain times between June 24 and July 9 because of a \"military firing exercise,\" according to a U.S. military communication about the warning provided to CNN.  The North Koreans had issued a similar warning prior to testing a long-range missile in April, but that warning indicated two potential danger areas more indicative of a long-range missile test.  The official said that these shorter-range missiles can be \"rolled out on a dime,\" but the U.S. intelligence community sees no \"readily observable\" indication of an imminent long-range missile launch.  Vehicular activity had been spotted around a long-range missile site in late May, U.S. Defense Department officials told CNN at the time. But the officials said the activity was very preliminary, with no missile parts seen, and any launch would take a lot more time to prepare.  The U.S. intelligence official said there is always concern that a shorter-range test \"could go wrong,\" but for the most part the North Koreans have short and medium missile tests \"down pat,\" and those missiles are \"pretty accurate.\"  The official added, \"It's not particularly difficult to fire off\" short- and medium-range missiles.  North Korea recently threatened to \"wipe out\" the United States if provoked.  Watch the Pentagon reaction to the threat \u00bb  The official said the United States \"assumes\" North Korea will \"continue its provocations.\" The official acknowledged this phase of the usual ebb and flow of North Korean behavior seems to be lasting longer.  This has been a \"protracted period,\" said the official, with the change in U.S. leadership being a \"big factor.\" The North Korean leadership seems to be \"testing the new administration.\"  Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell defended Gates' decision to deploy defensive measures around Hawaii.  \"Previous long-range ballistic missile tests by the North have been failures. But they obviously are intent on developing that capability, and so long as they are, we need to do responsible, prudent things,\" Morrell said at a news conference Wednesday. \"And in this case [Gates] thinks the responsible, prudent thing is to deploy those assets.\"  The U.S. military has positioned its Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile defense system and its X-band radar system in the event a missile were to be launched toward Hawaii.  Morrell said that no additional defenses were being deployed in the region because the defenses in place are sufficient.  \"I think we're perfectly comfortable with the assets that are in place,\" he said. \"This threat that is posed by North Korea is not a new one, so we have adjusted our assets that are normally in that area some time ago.\"  Separately, the United States has not yet decided to seek permission to board and inspect a North Korean vessel it suspects of carrying illicit weapons or technology in violation of U.N. sanctions against that country, despite a recent promise by President Obama that North Korean violations would \"be met with significant, serious enforcement of sanctions.\"  Morrell told reporters that while the United States is \"interested\" in the Kang Nam -- a North Korean-flagged vessel believed by officials to be carrying weapons or illegal technology -- no decision has been made to stop the ship and search it. The ship departed North Korea last week and is currently headed south toward Myanmar, U.S. officials believe.  The decision to enact the U.N. Security Council Resolution to investigate will most likely not be made just by the United States but in coordination with other countries, Morrell told reporters on Wednesday.  \"That's a decision that will have to be made at some point, and not necessarily just by us or this government,\" Morrell said. \"But that is a decision I think we will likely take collectively with our allies and partners out there, and make a determination about whether we choose to hail and query this particular ship. And if we make that decision, when and where to do so.\" Watch why U.S. officials are watching the Kang Nam \u00bb  Asked about the Myanmar connection Wednesday, Morrell would only say there is \"some notion of that\" but would not elaborate.  The United States has been tracking the ship's progress with air assets including the P-3 spy plane and the USS McCampbell, which recently replaced the USS John McCain in trailing the Korean ship.  The ship is suspected of carrying weapons because it is known to have carried proliferation materials previously, though U.S. officials concede they are not certain of the ship's holdings.", "Q": ["Q: North Korea recently threatened to \"wipe out\" what country  if provoked?

{"article": " -- The discovery of HIV, a breakthrough in the treatment of bipolar disorder, the advent of the contraceptive pill... CNN looks at some of the scientific discoveries that changed the world.  HIV was isolated by scientists in 1983 and named in 1986 by an international committee  THE DISCOVERY OF HIV/ AIDS  Originally called slimmer's disease, as sufferers lost a lot of weight, the first recorded case of HIV occurred in the Congo in 1977. After several infections, a Danish doctor died of pneumonia, which normally doesn't break through the body's immune system. The components of her disease had not yet been placed together, indicating that this was a new form of illness.  Other cases spread in following years around Africa and in homosexual men in New York and San Francisco. By 1980, 55 American men had been diagnosed with the disease. Research began in Europe, the U.S. and Africa to ascertain what this new disease could be.  The Centers for Disease Control found that the disease was caused by a virus being passed around by bodily fluids such as semen or blood. In 1981 it published its findings, saying the disease attacked T-cells, which help the body fight infection.  By 1983 the disease was isolated by teams of American and French researchers. In 1986 an international committee decided the virus should be called human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).  Education campaigns were unrolled around the world, advising people to avoid risky sexual behavior or sharing needles.  By June 1990, 139,765 people had the disease, with a 60 per cent mortality rate. The progress of the disease slowed down in the West with education campaigns and the development of protease inhibitors, which provided sufferers with almost complete remission. But in Africa, the spread and treatment of HIV remains a global concern.  THE DISCOVERY OF LITHIUM TO TREAT MOOD DISORDERS  Australian psychiatrist John Frederick Joseph Cade once said, \"I believe the brain, like any other organ, can get sick and it can also heal.\"  He made huge gains in healing the brain through his work with sufferers of bipolar disorder by discovering that lithium salts -- a naturally occurring chemical - could be used to treat the illness.  Previously, electro-convulsive therapy and lobotomies had been the major treatments for bipolar disorder.  After having been a prisoner of war in World War II, Dr. Cade served as the head of the Bundoora Repatriation Hospital in Melbourne Australia. It was at an unused kitchen in Bundoora where he conducted crude experiments that led to the discovery of lithium as a treatment of bipolar disorder. After trials on humans, Dr. Cade speculated that bipolar disorder was a \"lithium deficiency disease\" and that a dose of lithium had a calming effect.  Dr. Cade published findings in the Medical Journal of Australia in 1949 entitled \"Lithium salts in the treatment of psychotic excitement.\"  He died in 1980. Lithium is still used successfully in the treatment of mental illness to this day.  THE DISCOVERY OF BACTERIA  Dutchman Antonie van Leeuwenhoek was known as the \"father of micro-biology.\" He drew scientific attention to the many bacteria that he discovered. His research was helped by the different types of microscopes that he developed over his lifetime. From his powerful lenses he was able to ascertain many different types of lifeforms too small for the human eye to see.  It was by observing the build-up of plaque on teeth that the Dutch scientist discovered what we now know to be bacteria.  His initial observations on bacteria make for amusing reading. On September 17, 1683, Leeuwenhoek wrote to the Royal Society about the plaque between his own teeth, \"a little white matter, which is as thick as if 'twere batter.\" He then observed two women and two old men who had never cleaned their teeth in their lives.  Looking at these samples with his microscope, Leeuwenhoek wrote of \"an unbelievably great company of living animalcules, a-swimming more nimbly than any I had ever seen up to this time. The biggest sort... bent their body into curves in going forwards... Moreover, the other animalcules were in such enormous numbers, that all the water... seemed to be alive.\"  He also observed algae on water surfaces and the furry coating on human and animal tongues during illness, bringing his theories to the attention of the Royal Society.  Most bacteria are harmless, although some bacterial diseases are fatal: tuberculosis kills about 2 million people a year.  Bacteria are important in the production of cheese and yogurt, in processing wastewater and in manufacturing antibiotics.  THE CONTRACEPTIVE PILL  The oral contraceptive commonly known as \"the pill\" was invented during the 1950s in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts.  It contains hormone-like substances, usually estrogen and progestin, that enter the blood stream and disrupt the production of ova and ovulation, with the aim of preventing pregnancy.  It originated after an unexpected discovery made in a jungle in Mexico in the 1930s. While Professor Russell Marker was experimenting with plant steroids, he discovered a chemical process that transformed these steroids into the female sex hormone, progesterone.  Researchers in the late 1940s began to explore the possibility of an inexpensive oral contraceptive. Chemist Gregory Pincus tested a derivative from Marker's findings on 1,308 volunteers in Puerto Rico in 1958 and Searle Pharmaceuticals applied for US Food and Drug Administration approval to market the drug.  The pill came on to the market in the U.S. in 1960 and is still widely used today. E-mail to a friend.", "Q": ["Q: What led to the pill A:", "Q: Whose experiment led to the pill?

{"article": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- The BBC is refusing to broadcast a plea from leading British charities for aid to Gaza, saying the ad would compromise the public broadcaster's appearance of impartiality.  Demonstrators protest at the BBC's central London offices Saturday against the broadcaster's decision.  The decision prompted weekend protests in England and Scotland, with one group saying Sunday that 100 people had occupied the foyer of the BBC building in Glasgow, Scotland and would not leave until the BBC runs the ad.  The Disasters Emergency Committee, which includes the British Red Cross, Oxfam, Save the Children and 10 other charities, plans to launch the ad on Monday.  British broadcasters, led by the BBC, originally declined to air the appeal -- but in the face of criticism from government ministers and others, ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 changed their minds. CNN was not approached to broadcast the ad, a DEC spokesman said.  About 5,000 people demonstrated in front of the BBC's Broadcasting House in central London on Saturday over the broadcaster's stance. Seven people were arrested.  Watch protest against BBC decision \u00bb  In Glasgow, the London-based Stop the War Coalition said Sunday its supporters had moved into the foyer of the BBC building in what the group described as a peaceful protest.  The group did not plan to move beyond the foyer but intended to stay there until the BBC changes its decision, said Keith Boyd, a coalition member who called CNN on Sunday.  \"Primarily we are asking that the ad be shown,\" Boyd said.  The BBC press office would not confirm whether its Glasgow office was being occupied or if protesters were even there.  \"We don't comment on individual demonstrations,\" a statement from the BBC press office said.  The BBC is standing by its decision to not air the ad, director general Mark Thompson wrote in a blog post on the corporation's Web site.  \"We concluded that we could not broadcast a free-standing appeal, no matter how carefully constructed, without running the risk of reducing public confidence in the BBC's impartiality in its wider coverage of the story,\" he wrote Saturday.  \"Inevitably an appeal would use pictures which are the same or similar to those we would be using in our news programs but would do so with the objective of encouraging public donations. The danger for the BBC is that this could be interpreted as taking a political stance on an ongoing story,\" Thompson said.  \"Gaza remains a major ongoing news story, in which humanitarian issues -- the suffering and distress of civilians and combatants on both sides of the conflict, the debate about who is responsible for causing it and what should be done about it -- are both at the heart of the story and contentious,\" he added.  The BBC, which is funded by an obligatory license fee paid by every British household with a television, is required by its charter to be impartial. It does not carry commercial advertising but does broadcast charity appeals.  The DEC is \"disappointed that the BBC declined to support the Gaza appeal,\" the spokesman told CNN. \"It might limit the reach of our key message to the general public.\"  The spokesman, who asked not to be named, said the BBC had to make its own decision about impartiality.  \"That is a decision they must make. We have no view on that subject,\" he said.  Many readers of Thompson's blog post did have a view, however. The statement got hundreds of comments, most of them critical of the BBC.  A commenter who signed in as \"bully--baiter\" said the BBC was taking a side, no matter what it did.  \"Sorry Mr. Thompson but you cannot have it both ways. If deciding to accede to the DEC request would be seen as political then deciding not to accede to it is also political. Don't insult me with your disingenuous attempts to suggest it is otherwise,\" the commenter wrote.  Other commenters simply rejected Thompson's position out of hand.  \"I think the reasons for blocking help for a grave humanitarian disaster are simply astounding,\" \"brit--proud\" wrote. \"How can simply bringing food, medicines and homes to hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians be seen as political impartiality? How stupid do the BBC think the British public are?\"  But the corporation had its defenders as well.  \"The last thing I want to do, is fund the BBC to broadcast propaganda,\" \"SternG\" wrote: \"There's no way I will pay the BBC to air the DEC's politically-motivated 'appeal' for Gaza. Gaza is run by a government which is internationally recognized as a terrorist group, including by the EU. There is no doubt that some aid/fund will be 'procured' by Hamas.... Good decision BBC.\"  British broadcasters have refused to air some previous DEC appeals, the umbrella organization's spokesman said.  A planned 2006 appeal for aid to victims of the war in Lebanon was scrapped because \"there were genuine concerns, shared by the aid agencies, about the deliverability of aid.\"  Thompson cited doubts about whether DEC members could get aid to Gaza as a secondary reason for declining to take the ad.", "Q": ["Q: Who refuses to broadcast ad?

{"article": "HONG KONG, China (CNN) -- A 16-year-old Hong Kong boy makes two phone calls for delivery: One for pizza, the other for the drug ketamine. Two teenage girls are found semi-conscious in a car park after overdosing on ketamine. A 13-year-old boy joins a gang and is given free ketamine.  Glass capsules containing ketamine, which has become the drug of choice for Hong Kong's youth.  These are anecdotes told to CNN by police, a family doctor and a former gang member. Ketamine has become the drug of choice among young people, as the number of people under 21 taking drugs has surged 57 percent in the last four years in Hong Kong, said Commissioner for Narcotics, Sally Wong.  \"We started off with a very small number of young people taking drugs. We are now more worried about the trend,\" Wong said. \"We don't want a runaway trend; that's why we are stepping up action.\"  Ketamine, an animal tranquilizer, can put users in a dazed stupor for about two hours, doctors said. Long-term use of ketamine can impair cognitive function and damage internal organs.  Watch Pauline Chiou's report on ketamine sweeping Hong Kong \u00bb  An oversupply of the drug in Hong Kong and the fact that it is cheaper than other narcotics makes ketamine popular with young people, said Superintendent Wilson Fok of the Hong Kong Police Narcotics Bureau.  One gram of ketamine sells on the street here for $13 and is enough to be shared with two other people, while cocaine, for example, sells for $103 a gram, Fok said.  The drug is legal for medical use, but it is trafficked into Hong Kong from other parts of Asia, such as India and mainland China, and sold on the streets illegally, Fok said.  Police have recently stepped up their efforts to crack down on drug use at clubs and bars in Hong Kong and Shenzhen, a city in mainland China just across the border. Nearly 120 alleged drug users from Hong Kong, mostly under the age of 30, were arrested at entertainment venues in Shenzhen in July and held for 15 days in sweeps that made headlines for days here.  However, narcotics police said entertainment venues are not the only places they find drug abuse. \"Forty percent of young people abuse drugs in public toilets and playgrounds. That's what our recent data from last year shows,\" Fok said. \"They want to find some other places to take drugs.\"  The problem has gotten so bad that authorities have decided to do something never done here before: random school drug tests.  Beginning in September, some two dozen schools will conduct tests, as part of a trial program. Officials say the drug screening will most likely be in the form of urine tests, though they are still working out the details. Ketamine can be detected in urine for at least three days, doctors said.  Watch a doctor explain how the test works \u00bb  Dr. Cheng Chi Man, a family practice doctor, runs a seminar that trains doctors to detect the signs of drug abuse in young patients: drowsiness, skin problems, frequent urination (ketamine can affect bladder function) and frequent sick leave.  \"When we were 10 years old, we were still in primary school watching TV and eating candy. But they are now taking drugs.\"  Alman Chan, principal of Hong Kong's only drug rehab school for youth, the privately-run Christian Zheng Sheng School, said he has watched as drug use has grown.  See photos of the rehab school in remote Hong Kong \u00bb  \"Just look at our school development. I was here 14 years ago. At that time, I was the only teacher. I had 18 kids. I only had one student who was 15,\" he said. \"But now, I have one third -- about 40 of them -- who are 15 years old or younger. That shows you the number of students getting into drugs is bigger and also getting younger and younger.\"  There were a few reasons why children were getting involved with drugs, such as troubled homes and difficulties at school, he said. \"People are more concerned about material things and they are getting lost,\" he added.  Hong Kong Police have arrested children as young as age 13 for drug offenses, according to Commissioner for Narcotics, Sally Wong.  Police last week reportedly busted a network that allegedly recruited teenagers to sell illegal drugs-- mainly to students. One of those arrested -- a 14-year-old school dropout -- was found with 28 grams of ketamine, according to the South China Morning Post.  But ketamine abuse is not limited to young people. It is the second-most popular drug among all age groups in Hong Kong, Superintendent Wilson Fok of the Hong Kong Police Narcotics Bureau said.  Many young drug abusers end up in Alman Chan's drug rehab school for youth, which is located in a remote part of Lantau Island west of Hong Kong. CNN visited the campus, which is home to 99 boys and 24 girls. The closest road is a three-hour hike through the woods.  Chan calls the school \"the last stop before jail\" for drug abusers.  That was the case for Tai Ming Hung's son Keith, a former gang member. She learned he was using ketamine when he ended up in the hospital after taking the drug a few years ago.  \"I was in denial. I just didn't believe it was true. When I first heard about it, we all didn't know how to react, because we hadn't heard of those drugs before,\" she said. \"I didn't really understand why we have these harmful drugs in the world. And I was so afraid that it would kill my son.\"  18-year-old Keith, who said he began using ketamine at the age of 13 when he joined a gang, has recovered and is now living at Chan's school. \"I have a feeling that he's really growing up, he keeps improving,\" his mother said.  The school's curriculum involves regular school subjects and chores. The goal is for each student to finish their court probation and either sit for the university exam or continue on to a vocational school.  Many of the students have become interested in video editing and photography. There is a video lab on campus and the students showed CNN some video projects they have done. Other students run a pizza parlor and tea shop on a neighboring island. The average stay at the school is three years and students are encouraged to plan for life after rehab.  \"We have vocational training.

{"article": " -- Actor and filmmaker Joe Pantoliano, known for his role as Ralph Cifaretto on the HBO series \"The Sopranos,\" attended the Democratic National Convention on Monday to raise awareness about people living with mental illness.  Joe Pantoliano has met with the Obama and McCain camps to promote mental health and recovery.  Pantoliano, founder and president of the eight-month-old advocacy organization No Kidding, Me Too, released a teaser of his new film about various forms of mental illness. At the CNN Grill, he answered five questions for CNN.com.  CNN.com: What are you doing out here in Denver?  Pantoliano: I've always been fascinated by the political process ever since I was a kid.... I always love the festive partying, the camaraderie, the working for the candidate, whether it was somebody in the 3rd Ward where I lived in New Jersey in Hoboken or a senator or a congressman or even when a president would come. I remember when President Kennedy came down to Hoboken in '61 and I was only 10 years old. I was with the Kennedys tonight.  CNN.com: Are you a Barack Obama supporter?  Pantoliano: I'm advocating my organization. I'm going to the [Republican National Convention} next week. I'm speaking on mental illness and the miracles of recovery; that's what the movie is about. I've met with the Obama chief of staff and the Obama people; I've met with McCain people. Mental illness is on the tip of their minds.  CNN.com: Who are you voting for?  Pantoliano: I don't know yet.  Watch how celebrity endorsements can backfire \u00bb  CNN.com: Where are the hot spots in Denver? Where are people hanging out?  Pantoliano: Here, the CNN Grill. It's all they're talking about. I really like Denver. The security is less kinetic [than] it was four years ago. That whole fear thing that this administration has played on our nerves; I think I have post-traumatic stress over that. What happened was I became addicted to the news. iReport.com: Are you in Denver? Share sights, sounds  CNN.com: Do you think that coming out to a convention helps you make up your mind better than sitting in your living room?  Pantoliano: I'm an independent. I can be inspired tonight by Michelle Obama's speech, and then something happens next week, so I'm going back and forth. I'm a flip-flopper. The difference that I see between the Republicans and the Democrats are that the Democrats really are a force of what the melting pot of our society is. Obama really represents that.

{"article": "Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama, speaking to a gathering of gay and lesbian activists, said Saturday that he is committed to equality, citing the repeal of the military's \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy as an example.  Obama said his accomplishments on gay rights issues have been substantial since he last headlined the annual National Dinner of the Human Rights Campaign, in 2009.  He acknowledged \"we have more work to do,\" including on the issue of bullying.  The president currently supports same-sex civil unions, and has said his views on gay marriage are \"evolving.\" He recently announced his support of the Respect for Marriage Act, a bill that would repeal the Defense of Marriage Act, a 1996 law that defines marriage as between a man and a woman.  Organizations working actively to legalize same-sex marriage say they hope Obama eventually changes his stance.  While Obama spoke Saturday about equality, he did not speak on the marriage issue.  The president chided participants in a Republican presidential debate last month for not rebuking members of the audience who booed a gay soldier who asked about the repeal of \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell.\"  \"We don't believe in standing silent when that happens,\" Obama said of the debate incident. \"You want to be commander-in-chief, you can start by standing up for the men and women who wear the uniform of the United States even when it is not politically convenient.\"  After the debate, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum said he hadn't heard the booing when the question was asked. Santorum was being asked the question when the incident occurred.  Obama spoke of growing tolerance measured, he said, by ordinary Americans:  \"A father realizes he doesn't just love his daughter but also her wife.\"  Joe Solmonese, president of the Human Rights Campaign, said after the speech that Obama reaffirmed commitment to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans. \"It was a remarkable experience to see openly gay and lesbian uniformed service members in the audience be able to salute their commander in chief\" about the repeal of \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell.\"  Obama's remarks were delivered to a key constituency that hasn't always been receptive to the president's policies and style of leadership.  \"I'd like to see the president bring his message of support for the freedom to marry to a broader audience, perhaps in a conversational setting, so that all Americans can hear him talk about why marriage matters to loving gay and lesbian couples and their families,\" said Evan Wolfson, the founder and president of Freedom to Marry. \"It is important that the president lay out the case for Americans opening their hearts to the values of fairness and treating others as they would want to be treated.\"  Wolfson, along with other organizations advocating for legal same-sex marriages, said the Obama administration had made significant progress on some issues, but that support for marriage equality was still an important goal.  \"We applaud the administration's progress, while we also encourage him to 'evolve faster' on supporting full marriage equality,\" Stuart Gaffney, media director for Marriage Equality USA, said Saturday. He said he wasn't aware of any opposition within his organization to the HRC's selection of Obama as their keynote speaker.  \"We look forward to the day soon when our president stands with that pro-equality majority,\" Gaffney added.  The Log Cabin Republicans, an organization that represents gay and lesbian conservatives, said Obama's appearance Saturday night was more about politics than substantive policy change.  \"President Obama's appearance at the Human Rights Campaign Dinner this evening is more emblematic of their role as an ostensibly partisan organization than a representation of the gay and lesbian community,\" said Christian Berle, the group's deputy executive director.  Berle said Obama's stance on gay marriage didn't match that of most Americans.  \"As all Americans are becoming open to marriage equality, the president is taking a retreat,\" Berle said. \"Instead he is turning to the gay community for money and applause.  \"If the president wants to deserve all the money and adulation he has already received from the gay community, he should announce his firm support for everyone's freedom to marry,\" Berle said.  Saturday's event was expected to draw 3,000 gay activists, and took place at a convention center in downtown Washington. The speech was streamed live online.  A CNN/ORC International poll taken Sept. 9-11 showed 53% of Americans believe marriages between gay and lesbian couples should be considered valid. That number has steadily been rising in CNN/ORC International polls since 2008.  CNN's Athena Jones contributed to this report.", "Q": ["Q: Many gay rights activists applaud Obama's what?

{"article": "ISTANBUL, Turkey (CNN) -- Turkish, Iraqi and Syrian ministers met in Ankara on Thursday to discuss water shortages in the major Tigris and Euphrates rivers, which run through all three countries.  Iraqi fishermen ride their motor boat in the waters of the Tigris River in Baghdad.  The meeting comes amid a diplomatic spat over Iraqi accusations that Syria is harboring terrorists.  The Tigris River has plunged to record low levels, Iraqi farmers told CNN. Iraq is suffering a drought that its officials are calling a \"catastrophe.\"  Baghdad and Damascus want Turkey, where the source of the Tigris and Euphrates is located, to increase the flow of water passing through its network of dams.  \"Syria and Iraq are badly in need of water but our Iraqi brothers feel the need much more... it is why this meeting is so important,\" Turkey's official Anatolian Agency quoted Syrian Irrigation Minister Nader al-Bounni as saying at the start of Thursday's tri-partite meeting to address water resources. \"Our dams are empty and we have human needs.\"  Also attending the meeting was Iraq's Water and Natural Resources and Turkey's Environment and Forestry minister, as well as its Energy minister.  But at the start of the meeting at a hotel in the Turkish capital, Turkey's energy minister seemed to rule out delivering significant quantities of additional water to Iraq and Syria.  \"We are aware of the water needs of Syria and Iraq,\" Energy Minister Taner Yildiz told journalists at the entrance to the conference. \"Water is not plenty in Turkey, and therefore we cannot exceed the determined amount too much.\"  Turkey provided Syria and Iraq 500 cubic meters of water a second, Yildiz said. But, he added, central and eastern Turkey had only received 350 cubic meters/second of water this year.  The Turkish government said rainfall over its part of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers plummeted by about 46 percent in the past three years.  Over the past decade, some environmental and political analysts have written about the scenario of a \"water war\" possibly breaking out in the Middle East as countries affected by climate change compete over dwindling access to fresh water.  However, there are more immediate political tensions complicating relations between the neighboring countries.  Syria and Iraq have withdrawn their ambassadors from each others' capitals after a series of deadly suicide truck bombings in Baghdad killed more than 100 people last month.  Iraq demanded Syria hand over several suspects it accuses of organizing the attacks. Damascus has denied charges that it is harboring insurgents.

{"article": " -- Ireland --- once Europe's 'Celtic Tiger' -- was last year felled by its black hole of a banking sector, and forced to tap Europe's bailout fund.  The country continues to live off bailout funds -- yet in September internet giant Twitter announced its intention to set up headquarters in Dublin. It will join Facebook and Google, which both have their headquarters in the Irish capital.  The move suggests Dublin could again become a major player in the technology industry, despite the country's financial woes.  According to Noel Ruane, head of Dogpatch Labs Europe -- which likens itself to a 'frat house for geeks' -- the city has enough of an internet community to rival Silicon Valley.  Dogpatch Labs was created by the U.S.-based venture capital company Polaris Venture Partners, and provides a space for aspiring entrepreneurs to brainstorm with like-minded people.  The center has also chosen to call Dublin its European home, with Ruane as its entrepreneur in residence.  Ruane believes Dublin is a good base for emerging companies, despite their consumers being located elsewhere. Many companies are web based, and don't need to be near their customers, he says.  He acknowledges language barriers can prove more difficult for companies in Europe than in other parts of the world, such as the U.S.  \"There is a localization requirement; we don't have one homogenous market like the U.S. where there are 300 million plus people that companies can target.\" But he says the nature of the web means businesses can be successful from wherever they're located, including Dublin.  But while Dublin's reputation as an internet hub is growing, many developers are still honing their skills in the U.S first before establishing themselves in Europe.  \"I meet companies all the time where the founders have returned home after perhaps graduating from Stamford University and spending some years with the large internet companies in Silicon Valley,\" explains Ruane. \"They have all that experience so that they can set up business back in Europe.\"  CNN's Emily Smith contributed to this story.", "Q": ["Q: When will Twitter set up shop in Dublin?

{"article": " -- Researchers announced this week that they've found a new gene, ALS6, which is responsible for about 5 percent of hereditary Lou Gehrig's cases.  The discovery of a new gene mutation may allow those with ALS in their family to be tested.  It's being called a \"momentous discovery\" by the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis  Association.  Scientists at Massachusetts General Hospital, the University of Massachusetts and Kings College in London found the mutation by doing detailed sequencing of the genes in several families with an inherited form of ALS. The findings are published in the February 27 issue of the journal Science and were partially funded by the ALS Association.  ALS, a disease of the nervous system, impairs muscle movement and eventually results in total paralysis. It was brought to national attention in 1939, when famed Yankee baseball player Lou Gehrig's illness was diagnosed as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS. Today, the disease is most commonly known by his name.  ALS6 is a protein normally found inside a cell's nucleus, but in patients with Lou Gehrig's disease, it is found outside the nucleus and sometimes forms unusual clumps.  ALS researchers are unsure why this occurs but believe this finding, combined with a gene they discovered last year, TDP-43, may lead them to a firmer idea of what causes this deadly disease.  Both genes help in building and transporting proteins and making sure they're in the right place in cell structure -- a process called RNA processing.  Lucie Bruijn, senior vice president of research and development at the ALS Association, likens this process to building an engine: If there are parts missing or placed in the wrong place or in the wrong way, the engine doesn't work right.  \"Everything has an exquisite role and has to be in the right place, and any imbalance... can cause things to go awry,\" Bruijn said.  \"It's exciting because what it's starting to tell us now is that we might be starting to get an underlying theme,\" Bruijn said. \"We now have two genes with similar function strengthening the idea that alterations in RNA processing is important in ALS. A completely new direction and also involved in many other neurodegenerative diseases.\"  She believes this gives researchers \"huge\" potential to develop new therapies.  And new therapies are needed.  There is no cure and only one treatment for ALS, a neurodegenerative disease that seems to progressively attack the nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. These attacks can cause symptoms such as muscle weakness, twitching, cramping and thick speech, eventually leading to paralysis. According to the ALS Association, the disease strikes a little more than 5,600 people every year, and about 10 percent of those cases are hereditary.  The discovery of this new gene mutation will also allow those with ALS in their family to be tested for another gene (this makes three genes). Bruijn says a test \"will be possible; however, currently, it is not widely accessible\" and \"it would only be used in familial ALS patients.\"", "Q": ["Q: Which gene did the ALS association discover?

Mazen Abdul Jawad appeared earlier this month on Lebanese channel LBC's show \"Red Lines,\" on which he discussed foreplay, sexual conquests and how he picks up women, all taboo subjects in deeply conservative Saudi Arabia.

So, much like that tattoo of your initials you got emblazoned across your butt last summer after too many G&Ts, this new slang is here to stay.  Besides, Shakespeare coined the word \"puke,\" so it wasn't all sunshine and roses back in the 1500s, anyway.  Still, there are some internet terms that don't quite translate when applied to real-life situations (or, OK, any situation other than the original and intended one), because they're too obtuse, redundant or just plain stupid.  Here's our take on three of the most awkward phrases and symbols to go from screen to scene:  #  Ah, the hashtag. First introduced into the Twitter lexicon by Chris Messina in 2007, the hashtag was originally a way to tie together common threads of conversation (e.g., Follow Friday, tweets relating to events, news about natural disasters).  Now, however, the hashtag has also become a way in which to emphasize certain ideas on the microblogging site (\"This weekend has completely murdered my soul #whiskeyandheartache), and, more recently, to denote sarcasm and caustic wit (\"Wow, I really enjoyed that show. Etch-a-Sketch art is totally dope. More free wine, however, would have made the experience much more tolerable. #JustSayin').  That's all well and good in the Twitterverse, but when taken into the real world, the hashtag is a bit harder to hash out.  You see, the majority of society -- you know, the people who don't sit in front of their computers tweeting about how \"Eating pancakes makes me feel like death now that I'm 30 #notakidanymore\" -- doesn't understand what the hell you're saying when you tack what amounts to a pound sign onto any given sentence/word in your correspondence (e-mails, etc.). In fact, they could get offended by what you think is an artfully punctuated joke.  Listen, we do not yet have a symbol that translates into sarcasm (despite lofty efforts by the folks over at Sarcmark), and the hashtag is no exception. So, for now, stick to being caustic and dry, and even then, watch your mouth. Not everyone is socially fluent enough to recognize superior wit when they see it. #JustSayin'...  @  MoMA's Department of Architecture and Design may have added the \"@\" sign to its collection in March, but the artfully looping symbol has yet to find any real foothold in the conversational realm.  Look, it makes sense to add an @ to your name on Twitter, and Facebook now has a handy tagging feature that works with the addition of that particular keystroke, but referring to your friends as \"@Tom\" or \"@T-Bone\" in digital parlance such as e-mail or chat is just... well... redundant. You already said their name, so why do you need a directive?  Even more egregious is rattling off your Twitter handle in any person-to-person situation (Exception: At tech and social media events this rule is a little less hard and fast, given that your Twitter handle is akin to your phone number).  Not only does it reek of self-promotion, it's just weird. And take it from us, tech and social-media experts' behavioral standards should not exactly be your yardstick of appropriateness.  LOL  Hey, did you know that before \"LOL\" came to mean \"laughing out loud,\" it was code for \"little old lady\" in the medical world? Well, unless you're a doc alerting your compatriots to the arrival of a particularly ornery blue-haired broad, never should you stir your vocal cords to utter the phrase \"LOL.\"  Why? Because you're not actually laughing.  The day that LOL becomes common parlance, my friends, will be the day that this whole internet Bard-penned comedy will become a complete and utter tragedy.", "Q": ["Q: What has become the #?

{"article": "New York (CNN)  -- Rapper Lil Wayne will go directly to jail after he is sentenced by a Manhattan judge Tuesday afternoon for a gun conviction, according to a person familiar with the case.  Dwayne Carter, as he is known legally, pleaded guilty to felony gun charges in a deal with prosecutors October 2009. He is expected to get a one-year prison sentence.  His sentencing was delayed three weeks so he could get some dental work done, including removal of his diamond-studded braces.  The person familiar with the case would not confirm where Wayne would serve his sentence.  The plea agreement was a result of the rapper's 2007 arrest outside New York's Beacon Theater.  According to police, Wayne had a.40-caliber pistol on his tour bus.  \"It's not his gun, they know whose gun it is,\" Wayne's attorney, Stacey Richman, said after a hearing last month.  In an unrelated case, Wayne also faces felony drug possession and weapons charges in the state of Arizona.  Lil Wayne is a multiplatinum-selling and Grammy-winning rap artist. His hits include \"The Block is Hot\" and \"Lollipop,\" and his album \"Tha Carter III\" was the top-selling disc of 2008. His latest album, \"Rebirth,\" was released last month.

{"article": " -- Deep underground on the border between France and Switzerland, the world's largest particle accelerator complex will explore the world on smaller scales than any human invention has explored before.  The collider's ALICE experiment will look at how the universe formed by analyzing particle collisions.  The Large Hadron Collider will look at how the universe formed by analyzing particle collisions. Some have expressed fears that the project could lead to the Earth's demise -- something scientists say will not happen. Still, skeptics have filed suit to try to stop the project.   It even has a rap dedicated to it on YouTube.  Scientists say the collider is finally ready for an attempt to circulate a beam of protons the whole way around the 17-mile tunnel. The test, which takes place Wednesday, is a major step toward seeing if the the immense experiment will provide new information about the way the universe works.  \"It's really a generation that we've been looking forward to this moment, and the moments that will come after it in particular,\" said Bob Cousins, deputy to the scientific leader of the Compact Muon Solenoid experiment, one of six experiments inside the collider complex. \"September 10 is a demarcation between finishing the construction and starting to turn it on, but the excitement will only continue to grow.\"  The collider consists of a particle accelerator buried more than 300 feet near Geneva, Switzerland. About $10 billion have gone into the accelerator's construction, the particle detectors and the computers, said Katie Yurkewicz, spokewoman for CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, which is host to the collider.  In the coming months, the collider is expected to begin smashing particles into each other by sending two beams of protons around the tunnel in opposite directions. It will operate at higher energies and intensities in the next year, and the experiments could generate enough data to make a discovery by 2009, experts say. Check out the collider complex's six detectors \u00bb  Testing the unknown  Experts say the collider has the potential to confirm theories about questions that physicists have been working on for decades including the possible existence of extra dimensions. They also hope to find a theoretical particle called the Higgs boson, which has never been detected, but would help explain why matter has mass.  The collider will recreate the conditions of less than a millionth of a second after the Big Bang, when there was a hot \"soup\" of tiny particles called quarks and gluons, to look at how the universe evolved, said John Harris, U.S. coordinator for ALICE, a detector specialized to analyze that question.  Since this is exploratory science, the collider may uncover surprises that contradict prevailing theories, but which are just as interesting, said Joseph Lykken, theoretical physicist at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory.  \"When Columbus sails west, he thought he was going to find something. He didn't find what he thought he was going to find, but he did find something interesting,\" said Lykken, who works on the Compact Muon Solenoid, one of six experiments inside the collider complex.  Why should the layperson care about this particular exploration? Years ago, when electrons were first identified, no one knew what they were good for, but they have since transformed our entire economy, said Howard Gordon, deputy research program manager for the collider's ATLAS experiment.  \"The transformative effect of this research will be to understand the world we live in much better,\" said Gordon, at Brookhaven National Laboratory. \"It's important for just who we are, what we are.\"  Black hole fears are \"baloney\"  Fears have emerged that the collider could produce black holes that could suck up anything around them -- including the whole Earth. Such fears prompted legal actions in the U.S. and Europe to halt the operation of the Large Hadron Collider, alleging safety concerns regarding black holes and other phenomena that could theoretically emerge.  Although physicists acknowledge that the collider could, in theory, create small black holes, they say they do not pose any risk. A study released Friday by CERN scientists explains that any black hole created would be tiny, and would not have enough energy to stick around very long before dissolving. Five collider collaborators who did not pen the report independently told CNN there would be no danger from potential black holes.  John Huth, who works on the collider's ATLAS experiment, called such fears \"baloney\" in a recent interview, and noted that in normal physics, even if the black hole were stable, it could just pass through the Earth without being detected or without interacting at all.  \"The gravitational force is so weak that you'd have to wait many, many, many, many, many lifetimes of the universe before one of these things could [get] big enough to even get close to being a problem,\" said Huth, professor of physics at Harvard University.  At the scene  When visiting the general-purpose detectors CMS and ATLAS at the Large Hadron Collider, Lykken said he was awed that 30,000 tons of electronics would have to work without anyone fiddling with them all the time.  \"It just blows you away to look at these things and realize they're not only incredibly complex and huge, but they have to actually work,\" he said. \"They have to work without people banging on them all day because they're sitting underground all by themselves.\"  With twice as much iron as the Eiffel Tower, CMS will run at full power for the first time in conjunction with the first beam test Wednesday, Lykken said. The magnet serves to bend particles, whizzing by at almost the speed of light, to figure out what kind of particles they are.  Although the detector's parts weigh thousands of tons, in previous trials of CMS at lower power, the magnet actually yanked certain parts around because of its power, Lykken said.  \"You're talking about such incredible power inside both the accelerator and detectors that you never really know until you turn it all on what's going to happen,\" he said.  Scientists around the world are pumped for the first beam. Fermilab, the high energy physics lab in Batavia, Illinois, and major collaborator on the Large Hadron Collider, will be host of a \"pajama party\" at 1:30 a.m. CT that includes a live connection to CERN to follow the action.  Cousins believes that because the collider pushes the frontiers of science and technology, it would be \"amazingly impressive if it works the first try,\" he said in a phone interview from CERN. Any little disturbance of the magnetic field anywhere in the tunnel could stop the beam from making it all the way around.  Still, after a 25-year wait, he's not complaining. \"I personally will be fine if there's some problem that has to be overcome in the next few days,\" he said.", "Q": ["Q: What is the price of the Large Hadron Collider?

{"article": " -- In a new anti-Israel, anti-U.S. video, an American al Qaeda member makes reference to his Jewish ancestry for the first time in an official al Qaeda message.  Adam Yahiye Gadahn, also known as Azzam the American, is seen in an earlier al Qaeda video.  In the video, Adam Yahiye Gadahn, also known as Azzam the American, discusses his roots as he castigates U.S. policies and deplores Israel's offensive in Gaza that started in late December 2008 and continued into January.  \"Let me here tell you something about myself and my biography, in which there is a benefit and a lesson,\" Gadahn says, as he elicits support from his fellow Muslims for \"our weapons, funds and Jihad against the Jews and their allies everywhere.\"  \"Your speaker has Jews in his ancestry, the last of whom was his grandfather,\" he says.  Growing up in rural California, Gadahn embraced Islam in the mid-1990s, moved to Pakistan and has appeared in al Qaeda videos before.  He was indicted in the United States in 2006 on charges of treason and material support to al Qaeda, according to the FBI. Gadahn is on the FBI's Most Wanted List, with a reward of up to $1 million leading to his capture. FBI records show Gadahn's date of birth as September 1, 1978.  The video -- in which Gadahn speaks Arabic, with English subtitles -- surfaced on Saturday. This account is based on an English transcript provided by As-Sahab Media, the media production company used by al Qaeda.  Gadahn's Jewish ancestry has been reported in the news media. But terrorism analyst Laura Mansfield says it is the first time Gadahn acknowledged his Jewish ancestry in an official al Qaeda message.  Gadahn says his grandfather was a \"Zionist\" and \"a zealous supporter of the usurper entity, and a prominent member of a number of Zionist hate organizations.\"  \"He used to repeat to me what he claimed are the virtues of this entity and encouraged me to visit it, specifically the city of Tel Aviv, where relatives of ours live,\" says Gadahn, referring to Israel.  He says his grandfather gave him a book by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called \"A Place Among the Nations\" -- in which the \"rabid Zionist\" sets out \"feeble arguments and unmasked lies to justify the Jews' rape of Muslim Palestine.\"  But Gadahn says that despite his youth at the time, he didn't heed his grandfather's words.  \"How can a person with an ounce of self-respect possibly stand in the ranks of criminals and killers who have no morals, no mercy, no humanity and indeed, no honor?\" he says in reference to Zionists and Israel.  \"Isn't it shameful enough for a person to carry the citizenship of America, the symbol of oppression and tyranny and advocate of terror in the world?\"  Mansfield thinks the video may have been made between late April and mid-May, before President Obama's speech in Cairo, Egypt, addressing U.S. relations with Muslims.  Gadahn notes Obama's inauguration, Netanyahu's election in February, and Obama's speech in Turkey in April.  Specifically mentioning the Gaza offensive and citing other hot spots such as Iraq, Afghanistan, Chechnya and Somalia, where the \"Zio-Crusader alliance\" is fighting his \"brothers,\" he says \"this open-faced aggression\" comes as Obama has risen to power.  He scorns Obama's statements in his inaugural address and in Turkey that America isn't and won't be at war with Islam, and \"other deceptive, false and sugarcoated words of endearment and respect.\" He says Obama's language is similar to words Netanyahu uttered in the Knesset in 1996.  Gadahn also backs the idea of targeting \"Zio-Crusader\" interests anywhere in the world, not just \"within Palestine.\"", "Q": ["Q: What did the Californian convert to Islam do in al Qaeda video?

{"article": "Paris, France (CNN) -- France has denied citizenship to a man because he allegedly forced his wife to wear a full Islamic veil, the French immigration minister said in a statement Wednesday.  The man was applying for citizenship in order to join his French wife in France, Immigration Minister Eric Besson said. The man was refused citizenship because he was depriving his wife of the liberty to come and go with her face uncovered, Besson said.  The decision, made Tuesday, came exactly a week after a French parliamentary commission recommended a partial ban on any veils that cover the face -- including the burqa, the full-body covering worn by some Muslim women.  The ban -- which has not yet come up for a vote -- would apply in public places like hospitals and schools, and on public transport, the commission announced.  Foreigners may become French citizens if they marry French nationals and meet certain criteria, including integrating well in French society and having \"good morality,\" Besson said. It is on the criteria of morality that the man's citizenship request was denied, Besson said.  \"This individual imposes the full veil upon his wife, does not allow her the freedom to go and come as she pleases, and bans her from going out with her face unveiled, and rejects the principles of secularism and equality between man and woman,\" Besson said he told President Nicolas Sarkozy.  France's top court denied a Moroccan woman's naturalization request in 2008 on the grounds that she wore a burqa.  Sarkozy controversially told lawmakers six months ago that the traditional Muslim burqa was \"not welcome\" in France. He said the issue is one of a woman's freedom and dignity, and did not have to do with religion.  France has relatively tight controls on religion, according to the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life. It has among the most severe government restrictions on religion in Western Europe, as well as some of the highest levels of social tension involving religion, Pew senior researcher Brian Grim told CNN.  More than half of French people support a full ban veils, according to a recent opinion poll. The Ipsos poll for Le Point magazine found 57 percent of French people said it should be illegal to appear in public wearing clothes that cover the face.  That's despite government estimates that fewer than 2,000 women in the country actually wear the full Islamic veil.  France has about 3.5 million Muslims, representing about 6 percent of the population, according to Pew Forum research. The country does not collect its own statistics on religion in accordance with laws enshrining France's status as a secular state.  France already has a law against Muslim girls wearing headscarves in state schools. It sparked widespread Muslim protests when the French Parliament passed the law in 2004, even though the law also bans other conspicuous religious symbols including Sikh turbans, large Christian crucifixes and Jewish skull caps.

{"article": "Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- An Afghan political figure considered vital to peace efforts in the country was assassinated Tuesday, officials said.  Burhanuddin Rabbani, a former Afghan president who had been leading the Afghan peace council, was killed in an attack at his home.  NATO's International Security Assistance Force said two suicide bombers, \"feigning a desire to conduct reconciliation talks, detonated themselves.\"  Afghan officials earlier said there was one bomber.  The attacker hid the explosive device inside his turban, said Hasmat Stanikzai, spokesman for Kabul police.  An Afghan intelligence source told CNN that the bomber arrived at the house at the same time a meeting was due to take place between Rabbani and a delegation representing the Taliban insurgency.  Stanikzai said the bomber claimed to be a Taliban member who had come for the talks about peace and reconciliation, and detonated the explosives as he entered the home.  Four other people were wounded, including Masoom Stanikzai, a key adviser to Rabbani, the police spokesman said.  A doctor at a 400-bed hospital in Kabul said, \"We have received three people from the blast at Rabbani's house. Among the injured are Masoom Stanikzai, one bodyguard and an assistant\" to Rabbani.  Rabbani was long considered crucial to Afghan and coalition efforts to bring Taliban leaders into the reconciliation process.  He was also heading the United National Front Party, the largest political party that stands in opposition to President Hamid Karzai.  Karzai called Rabbani's killing a \"very tragic loss\" for his country.  Speaking at the United Nations in New York, Karzai described Rabbani as \"an Afghan patriot\" who \"has sacrificed his life for the sake of Afghanistan and for the peace of our country.\"  \"We will miss him very much,\" Karzai said.  Karzai cut short his time at the United Nations. His office said he would return to Afghanistan in the wake of the killing.  Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, said of the violence in Afghanistan, including Rabbani's assassination, \"We know that is the campaign the insurgents are on. We've got to adjust to that and protect the leaders.  \"Someone is going to have to step in very quickly because that is a critical part of the peace process,\" Mullen said of Rabbani's role. The killing represents the strategy of the Taliban to assassinate as many leaders as possible, Mullen said.  NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen called the assassination \"an attack on the Afghan people as they begin to take their country's security in their own hands.\"  \"To those who offer only death and destruction to the Afghan people, our message is clear: You will not prevail,\" he said in a statement.  Gen. John R. Allen, commander of ISAF, said the \"face of the peace initiative has been attacked.\"  \"This is another outrageous indicator that, regardless of what Taliban leadership outside the country say, they do not want peace, but rather war,\" Allen said in a statement.  The loud explosion heard in the attack on the home prompted temporary lockdowns at the nearby U.S. Embassy and ISAF headquarters as officials investigated the source of the blast.  Personnel at the U.S. Embassy were instructed to take cover late Tuesday afternoon due to an incident outside the embassy's perimeter, an embassy spokesman said.  \"It appears at this time that the embassy was not the target of the incident,\" spokesman Gavin Sundwall said in a statement. \"We are working to account for all embassy personnel and staff.\"  ISAF headquarters was on lockdown for about 30 minutes, an ISAF spokesman said.

{"article": " -- Joseph Maraachli, the infant who became the center of an international end-of-life debate, died peacefully in his sleep at his Windsor, Ontario, home, a spokesperson for the family said Wednesday.  Widely known in the media as \"Baby Joseph,\" the 20-month-old boy spent the last several months with his family and died Tuesday afternoon.  \"Obviously, it's been a very difficult day for the family today,\" said spokeswoman Emma Fedor. \"In some ways, it was a bit of a relief for the family.\"  Joseph's family had refused to accept a recommendation by a Canadian hospital to remove the boy's breathing tube and allow him to die. In March, the infant received a tracheotomy at a children's hospital in St. Louis, Missouri.  He was able to go home April 21.  \"By providing him with this common palliative procedure, we've given Joseph the chance to go home and be with his family after spending so much of his young life in the hospital,\" said Dr. Robert Wilmott, chief of pediatrics for SSM Cardinal Glennon Children's Medical Center in St. Louis.  A London, Ontario, hospital where Joseph was receiving care for a progressive neurological disease refused to perform a tracheotomy, a surgical procedure in which an opening is made into the airway through an incision in the neck to allow for suction of fluid out of the lungs.  In court papers, doctors in Canada said there was no hope for recovery. They would not perform a tracheotomy because they considered it to be invasive and not recommended for patients who require a long-term breathing machine.  Parents Moe and Sana Maraachli refused to accept the recommendation. The Maraachlis' daughter, Zeina, had died at home in 2002 after a tracheotomy after suffering similar complications, and the family wanted to offer the same care to their son.  \"To go through it once is enough for a lifetime, to go through it twice, it's just... unbelievable,\" Fedor said.  Joseph was \"very peaceful, in no pain whatsoever, no distress,\" when he died, Fedor said. He was buried Wednesday next to his sister.  The family was thankful for those who helped and prayed for Joseph, she added.  \"The heart of the issue would come down to the mix between respecting the parents' rights... to be in comfort of (their) own home, to die on God's time,\" said Fedor.  The family countered assertions that Joseph was nonresponsive, blind and deaf, she said. Instead, the boy could hear the parents' voices and look for them, Fedor told CNN. The family believed that, after a tracheotomy, Joseph could be freed from machinery.  The parents said that they, rather than physicians, should make a judgment on quality of life, Fedor said.  The Maraachli case caught the attention of the group Priests for Life, which funded Joseph's transfer and treatment at the SSM Cardinal Glennon Children's Medical Center. That hospital deemed the procedure medically appropriate and Baby Joseph underwent a tracheotomy there on March 21.  In April, Frank Pavone, national director of Priests for Life, said he considered this a \"victory over the culture of death.\" He says \"(Joseph) has gained benefit from his tracheotomy, is breathing on his own, and is going home to live with his parents.\"  Priests for Life is a Catholic pro-life organization that functions as a network to prevent abortion and euthanasia. The group often is noted for the graphic images depicting abortion its members and supporters use to make their case.  The London Health Sciences Centre -- the hospital where Joseph was initially treated -- in March said that \"there are clearly differences in the approach of these centres to the management of end-of-life care in this tragic situation\" and that \"the medical judgments made by LHSC physicians remain unchallenged by any credible medical source.\"  Nurses helped the family provide 24-hour care for Joseph in his final months. \"There was always somebody by his side,\" Fedor said.  The child was on almost no medication and apparently was in no pain, Fedor said.  \"When he was in the arms of his parents, you could tell,\" she said. \"He was settled when he was in their arms.\"", "Q": ["Q: in which hospital the child receives tracheotomy?

{"article": "LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- A man distraught because he could not find work shot and killed his mother-in-law, his wife and three sons and then killed himself inside a home in an upscale San Fernando Valley neighborhood, police said.  Police say Karthik Rajaram left  suicide notes taking responsibility for the murders of his family.  Authorities said the man had an MBA in finance but appeared to have been unemployed for several months and had worked for major accounting firms, such as Price Waterhouse.  The two-story rented home is in a gated community in Porter Ranch, about 20 miles northwest of Los Angeles.  The shootings were discovered after 8:20 a.m. Monday, after a neighbor called police to report that the wife had failed to pick her up to take her to her job at a pharmacy, Deputy Chief of Police Michel Moore said.  Ed Winter, assistant chief from the Los Angeles County Coroner's Office, identified the suspect as Karthik Rajaram, 45.  Winter said the victims included Rajaram's mother-in-law, Indra Ramasesham, 69, and his 19-year-old son Krishna Rajaram, a Fulbright Scholar and honor student at UCLA.  Watch police remove body from home \u00bb  Also dead were Rajaram's wife, 39, Subasari Rajaram, and their two other sons, 12 and 7. Some of the victims had been shot more than once, and their identities were not immediately confirmed, he said.  \"Due to the nature of their injuries, it's been a little difficult,\" Winter said, adding that there were no signs of a struggle.  Police first found the mother-in-law shot in her bed in a downstairs bedroom, Moore said.  Upstairs, the couple's eldest son was shot in the master bedroom; the wife in another bedroom with a gunshot wound to the head; the two younger sons in the bedroom they shared, both shot in the head. The 12-year-old was on the floor and the 7-year-old in bed, Moore said. Watch more on what police had to say about tragedy \u00bb  The suspect was also in that bedroom, a gun still in his hand.  The killings are thought to have occurred after 6 p.m. Saturday, when the man was last reported seen, Moore said.  Inside the house, police also found three letters, one to law enforcement acknowledging responsibility for the killings, a second to friends and relatives and a third that appears to be the suspect's will, Moore said.  \"He attests to some financial difficulties, and he takes responsibility for the taking of the lives of his family members and himself as a result of those financial difficulties,\" Moore said.  Neighbors, family and friends told police that the suspect, who had not worked for several months, had said in recent days he was having had extreme financial difficulties, Moore said.  One of the letters, intended for friends and marked \"personal and confidential,\" detailed his financial transactions that resulted in \"an unfortunate, downward spiral,\" Moore said.  \"His narrative is one of talking about this tragedy befalling him and his contemplation of an available exit or solution,\" Moore said. \"One is taking his own life and the other is taking the lives of his family and himself.... He talked himself into the second strategy, believing that was, in effect, the honorable thing to do.\"  Moore said the several-page narrative appeared to have been written over a period of time. \"This was something that was not a spur-of-the-moment type of event,\" he said.  Moore said it was clear to police that the family members were close and \"had an affection for each other.\" He said the parents had given up their master bedroom to their eldest -- who was spending the weekend home from college -- \"out of respect.\"  \"This is a perfect American family behind me that has absolutely been destroyed, apparently because of a man who just got stuck in a rabbit hole, if you will, of absolute despair, somehow working his way into believing this to be an acceptable exit.\"  No neighbors reported having heard gunshots, and there was no sign of forced entry at the house, Moore said.  Rajaram was involved in a financial holding company as part owner \"at least,\" Moore said.  There is no evidence he had had any history of mental difficulties, nor was there an indication he had sought counseling, Moore said.  Neighbor Trish Harrison, who lives three houses from the crime scene, said the family had lived in the community for about a year, but kept to themselves and had little interaction with neighbors. The parents were from India, she said.  The Los Angeles Unified School District was making arrangements for crisis counselors to visit the schools attended by the two younger sons.

{"article": "  -- A controversial Colombian senator who has obtained the release of 16 hostages held by Marxist guerrillas is the leading candidate to receive this year's Nobel Peace Prize, which will be announced Friday, said an independent research institute in Norway.  Sen. Piedad Cordoba, right, of Colombia reportedly is one of three top contenders for the Nobel Peace Prize.  Sen. Piedad Cordoba is the most likely recipient among three leading contenders, said the Oslo-based International Peace Research Institute. The others the institute named are Jordanian Prince Ghazi bin Muhammad, a philosophy professor in Islamic faith at Jordan University, and Afghan physician and human rights activist Sima Samar.  Though the institute considers Cordoba the front-runner, no single candidate has emerged as the clear-cut favorite, as sometimes happens, said Kristian Berg Harpviken, director of the peace institute.  \"It really is quite open this year,\" Harpviken said.  This year's peace prize nominees include 172 people and 33 organizations. The committee does not release the names of the nominees.  The 50-year-old peace institute, which is often called PRIO, has no connection with the Nobel committee that awards the peace prize.  Harpviken said he believes the prize will go to an individual or organization engaged in the resolution of a protracted armed conflict.  \"This is a [Nobel] committee that will perhaps be more proactive and will award somebody involved in a standing process rather than rewarding someone for past accomplishments,\" he said.  Cordoba, 54, heads Colombians for Peace, a group trying to end to the 45-year-old war between the government and the guerrilla Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, known as the FARC.  Since 2007, she has obtained the release of 16 hostages held by the FARC and has gotten commitments from the rebels for the release of several more. Colombian officials have said the guerrillas are holding about 700 captives.  A government critic and longtime peace activist, Cordoba was kidnapped by a right-wing paramilitary group in 1999. She was released after several weeks and then fled to Canada with her family, where she stayed for 14 months before returning home. There have been at least two assassinations attempts against her.  \"While it is the hostage releases that have brought Cordoba and her organization the most attention, her role as a principal proponent of peace negotiations and of long-term reconciliation is probably more important to her candidacy for the Nobel Peace Prize,\" PRIO said in a release.  Harpviken said he had received many complaints because of his prediction about Cordoba, whom critics accuse of being too close to the rebels. \"I do realize that this created some debate in Colombia,\" he said. \"That's not terribly surprising.\"  Cordoba was nominated by Argentinean human rights activist Adolfo Perez Esquivel, winner of the 1980 Nobel Peace Prize.  Harpviken said Muhammad, an Islamic scholar known for trying to bridge gaps with other faiths, also is a leading candidate. \"Certainly, the purpose... he stands for makes him very strong,\" Harpviken said.  A member of the Jordanian royal family and educated at Princeton and Cambridge universities, where he received a doctorate, Muhammad, 42, \"is playing an increasingly central role as an advocate of interfaith dialogue,\" PRIO said.  In 2005, the prince brought together 170 Islamic scholars from 40 countries for the Amman Initiative to work out what they called a \"theological counter-attack against terrorism.\"  Two years later, Muhammad and other prominent Islamic scholars wrote a letter called \"A Common Word Between Us and You\" that urged mutual understanding and peace with Christians.  The letter, PRIO said, was partly a response to Pope Benedict XVI's 2006 lecture that many saw as an attack on Islam. Backing his words with his deeds, Muhammad gave what was considered a broadly accommodating welcoming speech when the pope visited Jordan this year.  \"The importance of Prince Ghazi's initiatives to date lies first and foremost in the way he engages Islamic theology, institutions and leaders in a debate on the relationship between Islam and other faiths, thereby contributing a wider platform for interreligious dialogue for Muslims in general,\" PRIO said. \"A prize to Prince Ghazi would also be recognition of the long-standing efforts of the Jordanian royal family, including King Abdullah, who have been long-standing proponents of peace and reconciliation in the Middle East.\"  If Muhammad does not win, Harpviken said, it could be because his work is not done.  \"He still has a way to go so that his ideas have an impact,\" Harpviken said.  The third PRIO front-runner is Samar, head of the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission and the U.N. special envoy to Darfur in Africa.  A medical doctor, Samar also established the Shuhada Organization, which focuses on health care, particularly for Afghan women.  After obtaining her medical degree in 1982, Samar and her son fled to Pakistan in 1984 when the communist regime then ruling Afghanistan arrested her husband.  Samar, 52, remained in exile until 2002 when she was appointed as a women's affairs minister in Afghan President Hamid Karzai's transitional administration.  \"She has been under frequent attacks both from conservative religious leaders and from Islamist radicals, and she is a prominent voice for the rights of women,\" PRIO said, adding that she \"does invite respect by being a principled and outspoken proponent of human rights and the need for a true reconciliatory process.\"  According to other published reports, another possible pick is monk Thich Quang Do, head of the outlawed United Buddhist Church of Vietnam. He has been under house arrest since 2001 and has been in and out of jail since his first detention by communist authorities in 1977.  Quang Do, 80, was awarded the annual human rights prize by the Rafto Foundation of Norway in 2006.  Four recent Rafto winners have gone on to garner the Nobel Peace Prize: Aung San Suu Kyi of Myanmar (also known as Burma), Jose Ramos-Horta of East Timor, Kim Dae-jung of South Korea and Shirin Ebadi of Iran.  Azerbaijani journalist and human rights activist Malahat Nasibova was awarded the Rafto this year and also is considered a possible Nobel prize winner.  Chinese dissidents Hu Jia, Gao Zhisheng and Wei Jingsheng also are contenders, other observers said.  After months of house arrest, Hu, 36, was detained in December 2007 during a crackdown on dissidents and sentenced to 3 1/2 years in April 2008 for \"inciting subversion of state power.\"  Hu started his activism focusing on HIV/AIDS in 2001 and co-founded a grassroots organization dedicated to helping children from AIDS families. The international human rights group Amnesty International said Hu's focus broadened and he began reporting on a wider human rights violations in China, even giving interviews to international journalists.  Amnesty said Hu has been repeatedly beaten and harassed by police for his outspokenness. Before being arrested, he had publicly expressed concerns over human rights abuses by police in Beijing.  Gao, who was born in 1966, is a self-taught lawyer and People's Liberation Army veteran who was a Nobel Peace Prize candidate last year. He disappeared in February after being taken away by Chinese police. Fellow activists say he is believed to still be alive.  In 2007, he wrote a letter to the U.S. Congress urging the United States to boycott the Olympic Games held in Beijing the following year. In it, he described a wide array of human rights violations by the Chinese government -- from lack of property and religious rights to environmental disasters to Tibet.  \"I ask to you to seriously consider the true value of morality, justice, and humanity, as well as to what extent such values are undermined in China,\" he said.  Wei, 59, was first arrested in 1979 and sentenced to 15 years. He was released in 1993 but arrested again within six months and sentenced to 14 years. In 1997, Chinese authorities put him on a plane to the United States, where he has lived since.  Perhaps the best known of the Chinese dissidents, Wei has been awarded the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Human Rights Award, the European Parliament's Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, the National Endowment for Democracy Award and the Olof Palme Memorial Prize. He has been nominated seven times for the peace prize.  Harpviken said he doubts the Nobel committee will choose any Chinese or Russian dissidents this year because they \"don't want to anger powerful governments.\"  \"Although the committee takes pride in being independent,\" he said, \"there are certain limitations on their being independent.\"  That does not mean he doesn't expect the committee to \"take daring decisions.\"  Harpviken said he believes that \"the most likely expression of the committee's courage this year will be to award the prize either to an unconventional kind of candidate or to somebody whose work is likely to be directly helped by a prize award.\"  The peace prize is one of five awarded annually since 1901 by the Nobel Foundation in Stockholm, Sweden. The other four prizes are for physiology or medicine, physics, chemistry and literature. Starting in 1969, the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel also has been awarded.  While the other prizes are awarded by committees based in Sweden, the peace prize is determined by a five-member panel appointed by the Norwegian parliament.  The Nobel recipient receives a prize of 10 million Swedish crowns, or about $1.4 million.  CNN's Arthur Brice contributed to this report.", "Q": ["Q: Is a Jordanian prince among the contenders?

{"article": " -- Alan Kardec scored a spectacular second-half winner for Brazil against Costa Rica to set up a replay of the 1993 Under-20 World Cup final against Ghana in Egypt.  Costa Rica midfielder David Guzman, left, battles for the ball with Brazil captain Giuliano.  Four-time champions Brazil edged a 1-0 victory against underdogs Los Ticos in Cairo after the Black Satellites qualified for the final for the third time with a 3-2 victory against suspension-hit Hungary in the first semi.  Striker Kardec's 67th-minute goal, his fourth of the tournament, lit up an otherwise uninspiring match as he crashed home a superb volley from a tight angle after substitute Bertucci's left-wing cross bounced to the far post.  Costa Rica had lost their opening game of the tournament to Brazil by a morale-sapping 5-0, but bounced back to reach the last four, beating hosts Egypt and the United Arab Emirates in the previous rounds.  The Central Americans came closest to scoring in the first half as David Guzman's 25-yard free-kick forced a fine save from Brazil goalkeeper Rafael.  However, the South Americans' dominance of possession -- they had an incredible 70 percent of the play -- finally told, with players lining up to take potshots at Costa Rica's goal.  But Los Ticos held on bravely, and even sent goalkeeper Esteban Alvarado to the other end of the pitch for three late corners, but the lack of quality in crucial areas was telling.  Ghana will be seeking to win the tournament for the first time on Friday, having lost to Brazil in the 1993 final and to Argentina in 2001.  The Africans looked lethal in attack against a Hungary side missing three key players following the dramatic 3-2 victory over Italy in the quarterfinals, but suffered from defensive lapses.  Dominic Adiyiah netted twice to give Ghana a 2-0 halftime lead before Marco Futacs pulled one back, but Abeiku Quansah crashed a spectacular late goal to make it 3-1 and substitute Adam Balajti set up a tense finish.  Striker Adiyiah netted the opener from close range in the ninth minute after Andre Ayew pounced on Adam Presinger's poor back-pass and rounded goalkeeper Peter Gulacsi.  He then scored a tournament-leading eighth goal in the 31st minute with a powerful header from Samuel Inkoom's cross.  Balazs Megyeri hit the post for Hungary in the second half before fellow substitute Marko Futacs reduced the deficit in the 73rd minute after a pass into the penalty area from Andras Simon.  Roland Varga and Janos Szabo both squandered golden chances to level, the latter from a simple header, and Ghana made the most of their escapes when Quansah crashed in a shot off the underside of the crossbar in the 81st minute.  David Addy's lapse allowed Balajti to comfortably sidefoot home just three minutes later, but it was Ghana who looked most likely to score again as Emmanuel Agyemang-Badu smashed a fierce long-range shot against the bar in time added on.", "Q": ["Q: Who led 2-0 at halftime?

{"article": "PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (CNN) -- Nearly 100 Thai soldiers crossed into Cambodian territory Wednesday near a disputed border temple that was the site of clashes last year, Cambodian officials said.  Cambodian troops guard the Preah Vihear temple late last year amid heightened tensions with Thailand.  The Thai army denied the claim.  Thai soldiers crossed into the area of the 11th century Preah Vihear temple about 1:40 p.m., said Phay Siphan, secretary of the Cambodian Council of Ministers.  The two sides did not fight and Cambodia has asked Thailand to pull back.  Thai Army Col. Sansern Kaewkumnerd said the troop movement was part of a normal rotation and that Thai soldiers had not gone anywhere they were not permitted to be.  For months last year, the two countries saber-rattled over the ancient temple. The nations differ on whether some territory around the temple forms part of Thailand or Cambodia.  Both countries posted troops in the area after the United Nations in July approved Cambodia's application to have the temple listed as a World Heritage Site -- a place the United Nations says has outstanding universal value.  The temple sits atop a cliff on Cambodian soil but has its most accessible entrance on the Thai side.  The International Court of Justice awarded the temple to Cambodia in 1962. Thailand claims, however, that the 4.6 sq. km (1.8 square mile) area around it was never fully demarcated.  Thailand says the dispute arose from the fact that the Cambodian government used a map drawn during the French occupation of Cambodia -- a map that places the temple and surrounding area in Cambodian territory.  The United Nations' decision re-ignited tensions, with some in Thailand fearing it will make it difficult for their country to lay claim to disputed land around the temple.  Last year's flare-up began July 15, when Cambodian guards briefly detained three Thais who crossed into the area. Once they were let go, the three refused to leave the territory.  Cambodia claimed Thailand sent troops to retrieve the trio and gradually built up their numbers. Thailand denied that, saying its troops are deployed in Thai territory.  -- CNN's Tim Schwarz in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, and Kocha Olarn in Bangkok, Thailand, contributed to this report.", "Q": ["Q: Where are the Thai soldiers accused of crossing into?

{"article": "KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Florida (CNN) -- So, what's harder, steering a space shuttle or out-machoing Tom Cruise on the set of \"Top Gun\"?  Scott Altman is commander of the current space shuttle mission to upgrade the Hubble Space Telescope.  Scott Altman laughs when he answers the question.  \"Flying a space shuttle is a little more challenging than what we did in the movie, although the flying was a lot of fun,\" said Altman, who knows more than a little about both.  The retired Navy F-14 fighter pilot is the commander of the current space shuttle Atlantis mission to repair and upgrade the Hubble Space Telescope. He also doubled for the actors, including Cruise, during the Southern California shoot of the 1986 hit movie.  Then a young pilot, Altman had just gotten back from a 7\u00bd-month tour onboard an aircraft carrier when he got the \"Top Gun\" call from his commanding officer.  \"The skipper of our squadron picked four guys he thought he could trust to have this kind of carte blanche to break the rules a little bit,\" Altman said. That included a scene in which a brazen Navy pilot buzzes the base's control tower. That would never happen in real life, Altman said.  The movie features Cruise as a young naval aviator, Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell, selected to attend fighter-pilot training school at the then-Miramar Naval Station north of San Diego. To prepare for the film, Cruise flew in the backseat of an F-14 several times, including once with Altman.  \"The actors were all pretty easy to get along with. Tom Cruise, for example, was very motivated,\" recalled Altman, who is making his fourth trip into space this week. \"He enjoyed flying. He listened to what we told him and became a pilot himself after that.\"  Altman is not one to brag about his flying in \"Top Gun.\" The U.S. space agency, NASA, doesn't mention his film heroics, either. But Altman is in one of the movie's most memorable scenes. While flying upside down, inverted, Altman gives an obscene gesture to the pilot of an enemy plane.  \"They said go ahead and gesture at the other airplane,\" said Altman, 49, with a smile. \"So when you're looking at the scene where he's communicating with the Russian, or the bad-guy pilots in the movie, that would be my finger.\"  But the flying scenes with the actors didn't all work out as director Tony Scott had hoped.  \"The director had to pay $7,600 an hour to rent an airplane,\" Altman recalled. \"But after a week of spending that much money on the airplanes, he decided he couldn't use the footage. The actors all looked a little green, he said.\"  Altman and the other pilots earned $23 a day for their trouble.  But his biggest disappointment was not getting to see the film as soon as it was released. He and the other pilots were invited to a preview screening, but a commanding officer would not let them go.  And by the time the movie hit theaters, Altman was busy. He was overseas, on another seven-month tour of duty.", "Q": ["Q: Who worked alongside Tom Cruise? A:", "Q: Who did Altman work with in this film?

{"article": "ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- A paper cape sits loosely around your shoulders, covering your naked chest. A radiology technologist directs you toward an imposing-looking machine. As you hold your breath, one bare breast at a time is tightly compressed between two flat panels and X-rayed.  You'll undress from the waist up for a mammogram; wearing two pieces, not a dress, makes it easier.  It's a scene that's been repeated more than 35 million times in the past year at certified mammogram facilities around the United States.  No matter what their age, race or medical history, the female patients probably shared a similar experience during the 20-minute procedure.  \"Mammograms are known to be uncomfortable,\" concedes Dr. Sujatha Reddy, an Atlanta, Georgia,-based gynecologist. \"The harder they squeeze and squish that breast, the less tissue the X-rays have to go through and the more likely they are to find something.\"  The American Cancer Society reports two to four mammograms out of every 1,000 lead to a diagnosis of cancer. About 10 percent of women who have a mammogram will require more tests.  Accuracy often depends on patient cooperation, but Reddy reveals there's another side as well: \"A mammogram is only going to be as good as the technician and the doctor who read it, so you want to go to a good place.\"  A recent study in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute reports that doctors reading mammograms miss an average of two in every 10 cases of breast cancer.  Medical experts remind women that mammograms alone don't guarantee a clean bill of health.  \"I wish I could say the mammogram could find 100 percent of breast cancers,\" Reddy said. \"I think we have to rely on having a clinical breast exam once a year at a health care provider and doing your self-breast exam on a monthly basis.\"  Reddy recommends having mammogram screenings at a reputable facility that is certified. She also suggests going to the same office every year so that old X-rays can be compared with new films.  A convenient location is another factor that makes it more likely that someone will actually show up for an annual mammogram appointment.  Health Minute: Watch more on what to expect during a mammogram. \u00bb  Fear of discomfort is what often keeps some women away.  Reddy advises her patients to schedule a screening appointment for the early part of their menstrual cycle. \"The best time of your cycle to do a mammogram is going to be when your period is over, maybe the week after your period is done when the breasts are not going to be tender.\"  Caffeinated coffee, tea and soft drinks may also contribute to tender, lumpy breasts. Experts recommend avoiding caffeine for a week before the procedure.  Before having any type of imaging test, the Cancer Society warns patients to tell technicians if they think they might be pregnant or are breast feeding.  Similarly, reveal any unusual breast symptoms or problems before a mammogram.  The screening requires women to undress from the waist up. You'll be given a disposable wrap to put around your shoulders and chest. Wearing a two-piece outfit will make the process easier and more convenient.  Technicians tell patients not to wear deodorant, antiperspirants, perfumes or powders. They might leave a residue that can be picked up on the X-rays, interfering with the results.  All mammogram facilities are required to issue results within 30 days, but many will contact patients within a week if there is a problem with the mammogram.  The Cancer Society recommends women 40 and older get a mammogram every year. Younger women may be advised to be screened earlier if there is a family history of breast cancer.

{"article": " -- Jeanne Tripplehorn's movie is about women and breast cancer. And it's airing on Lifetime.  Uh oh, this could get weepy.  Tripplehorn, who has starred in cable show \"Big Love,\" knows how preachy and awkward cancer movies can get.  \"This was something different,\" she said, of the film ,which airs Monday at 9 p.m. \"I spoke with Lifetime and they wanted it to be a new approach and a new way of looking at cancer.\"  The actress has seen the disease's toll.  \"Like all women, I had been affected,\" she said. \"Women in my family dealt with breast cancer. They all survived. It was important for me to do this on a lot of different levels. It wasn't just a paycheck.\"  The movie, \"Five\" tells stories of different women coping with breast cancer in five vignettes. Tripplehorn's character, an oncologist is the tie that binds the five stories together. Her character loses her mother to breast cancer as a young girl and becomes an oncologist.  The project has a bevy of star power. The executive producers are Jennifer Aniston, Marta Kauffman, co-creator of the series \"Friends\" and Kristin Hahn, who was the executive producer of \"The Departed.\" Aniston, Demi Moore and Alicia Keys each directed one of the vignettes. The ensemble cast includes Patricia Clarkson, Rosario Dawson, Ginnifer Goodwin, Josh Holloway, Tracee Ellis Ross, Tony Shalhoub and Jeffrey Tambor.  Tripplehorn answered a few questions for CNN not long ago.  CNN: Did you work with an oncologist, or consult a doctor for your role?  Tripplehorn: I consulted an oncologist. I read a lot.  The thing that I found confusing and frustrating is once you have this diagnosis, there is this maze of doctors.  There wasn't one particular way of dealing with a diagnosis. I was just very confused to the journey that one takes after a diagnosis. You have your mammogram, your radiologist, your oncologist.  Jen [Aniston] and her producing partner Kristin [Hahn] toured a clinic that hopefully will become a model for clinics across the country. It's almost a one-stop shop with everything a woman needs - the doctors, radiologists. It's all under one roof. And hopefully that will simplify before we get a cure.  CNN: What resonated with you about the story?  Tripplehorn: Just the way they were telling the story -- the five short films dealing with different women with the diagnoses.  I thought it was an interesting way of telling stories. Five directors who are women, for me, personally, it was a great experience to work with each of these directors. Alicia Keys is a first time director. You would never know it when you see her film.  CNN: Did having family members who've had breast cancer influence you in taking part in this project?  Tripplehorn: I had two women on my mother's side of the family; both went through bouts of breast cancer. Both survived.  My grandmother was a two-time survivor of breast cancer. She passed away of something different 15 years after her last diagnosis.  It's close to my heart and experience.  CNN: Having family members who've had this disease, does it make you concerned about your risk?  Tripplehorn: It's a constant reminder. It's always in the news. It's always out there. So, it's just what you live with. It's what you face.  You try to watch your diet, you're constantly aware of it. Some people put their head in the sand and I'm not that kind of person. I'm very aware of it.  CNN: Your character in the movie gets genetic testing for breast cancer. Have you ever thought about it?  Tripplehorn: I think it's a personal thing. It's not something that I'm thinking of doing. It's very personal.  CNN: What's your message through this movie?  Tripplehorn: No woman should have to go through this. I've seen it up close and personal. The fact that we're airing this during Breast Cancer Awareness Month, it's a small part that I could do -- if I could raise awareness, if women see this and get a mammogram.  When I started this project, it had been two years since I got a mammogram, because I was so busy. That's what happens with women. They are so busy taking care of other people, they don't put themselves first. You have to go out and do these small things. Getting a mammogram, doing your monthly self-exam, your diet, just taking care of yourself. If this film will remind women out there to do just that, that's a step in the right direction.  It's not every project that you can do this -- that can possibly directly impact somebody's life. And that was my hope.", "Q": ["Q: Who knows how preachy and awkward the movies get?

{"article": " -- Sri Lanka's president declared Wednesday that the country's Tamil insurgents are on the verge of total defeat, saying their demise has helped unite the island nation on the 61st anniversary of its independence.  Sri Lankan president Mahinda Rajapaksa  \"We are today a nation that has defeated a powerful enemy that stood before us,\" Mahinda Rajapaksa said in his independence day speech. \"Our entire nation is now united in the shade of the national flag.\"  But in other parts of his speech, Rajapaksa indicated that the fight against the Tamil Tiger rebels was not over.  \"I am confident that in a few days we will decisively defeat the terrorist force that many repeatedly kept saying was invincible,\" he said.  In another part of the speech, he said, government forces over the past two and a half years have \"been able... to almost completely defeat\" the rebel forces.  Sri Lanka's Defense Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa rejected calls Wednesday for a negotiated end to the fighting. He said there would be no political solution, the online edition of The Island reported. Some in the international community have suggested negotiations to give the rebels an opportunity to surrender.  That idea is ridiculous, an angry Rajapaksa told The Island, emphasizing that nothing short of unconditional surrender of arms and cadres could end the offensive on the Vanni front.

{"article": "CAIRO, Egypt (CNN) -- Omar bin Laden has a message for his father, Osama: \"Find another way.\"  Omar bin Laden says he last saw his father in 2000 when the son decided to leave al Qaeda.  The son of the most-wanted man in the world spoke Sunday to CNN in a quiet, middle-class suburb about an hour outside Cairo, Egypt.  Omar bin Laden, who works as a contractor, said he is talking publicly because he wants an end to the violence his father has inspired -- violence that has killed innocent civilians in a spate of attacks around the world, including those of September 11, 2001.  \"I try and say to my father: 'Try to find another way to help or find your goal. This bomb, this weapons, it's not good to use it for anybody,' \" he said in English learned in recent months from his British wife.  He said that's not just his own message, but one that a friend of his father's and other Muslims have expressed to him. \"They too say... my father should change [his] way,\" he said.  Watch whether Omar bin Laden thinks his father will ever be caught \u00bb  He said he hasn't spoken to his father since 2000, when he walked away from an al Qaeda training camp in Afghanistan with his father's blessings. He said he has no idea where his father is, but is confident he will never be caught because locals support him.  Asked if his father might be living along the Afghan-Pakistan border, he said, \"Maybe, maybe not.\"  \"Either way, the people there are different,\" he said. \"They don't care about the government.\"  Now, he and his wife are preparing to launch a movement far different from the one his father, Osama bin Laden, launched. They are pursuing a movement for peace.  At first glance, Omar bin Laden appears to have little in common with the man who has eluded international efforts to find him. The 26-year-old's hair is bound in neat braids, he drives a Jeep and is married to a British national twice his age.  But the physical resemblance quickly sinks in, even without the long beard his father favors. It is a resemblance he doesn't avoid. \"Being Osama's son, I don't hide it. I don't hide my name,\" he said.  \"I am proud by my name, but if you have a name like mine you will find people run away from you, are afraid of you.\"  He said he doesn't consider his father to be a terrorist. When his father was fighting the Soviets, Washington considered him a hero, he said.  \"Before they call it war; now they call it terrorism,\" he said. He said his father believes his duty is to protect Muslims from attack.  \"He believes this is his job -- to help the people,\" he said. \"I don't think my father is a terrorist because history tells you he's not.\"  However, Omar bin Laden -- who was 14 when he began training in al Qaeda camps -- said he differs greatly with his father over the killing of civilians.  Was 9/11 a just attack?  \"I don't think 9/11 was right personally, but it happened,\" he said. \"I don't think... [the war] in Vietnam was right. I don't think what's going on in Palestine is right. I don't think what's going on in Iraq is right.  \"If we make what is right and not right, we will make a very big list,\" he said.  He said he left al Qaeda because he did not want to be associated with killing civilians. He said his father did not try to dissuade him from leaving al Qaeda.  \"I told him I was going, and wanted to try life and see what it was like outside because, from a young age I was with my father, and I only saw and heard my father and his friends. My father told me, 'If this is what your choice -- your decision -- is, what can I tell you? I like you to be with me, but this is your decision.' \"  So father and son went their separate ways.  But there has been no running from the bin Laden name, not after the events of September 11. On that day, Omar bin Laden was in Saudi Arabia, where 15 of the 19 hijackers were from.  Asked if, upon learning of the news, he knew his father had been behind it, he replied, \"Yeah, maybe.\"  He said he felt sadness for those killed. \"I don't think 9/11 was right personally,\" he said. \"I don't agree with 9/11 or with any war where only civilians are dying.\"  Asked why he did not protest more strongly his father's role in the killing of civilians, he said it is up to the religious clerics close to his father to tell Osama bin Laden to change tactics in the name of Islam.  And even if that most unlikely scenario were to occur, he said, al Qaeda would not stop. \"My father doesn't have the power to stop the movement at this moment.\"  Sitting by his side throughout the hour-and-a-half interview was his wife, Zaina. The two are organizing a multi-month horserace through North Africa in the name of peace, set to kick off this year.  But getting sponsors to line up behind the name bin Laden has been difficult. \"It would probably have been easier to do a race without having Omar's name, but then the race would just be a race, it wouldn't be a race for peace,\" his wife said.  Omar bin Laden said his relationship with his father was limited. He is the fourth of 11 children born to his father's first wife, and he is one of 19 children Osama bin Laden has fathered. \"Most of the time he busy, so busy, all the day he's busy [with] his friends. He was working a lot.\"  Omar bin Laden is now undertaking perhaps an impossible task: trying to rebrand the name they share.  But he said he is not looking for approval from his father. \"My life, I take care of my life,\" he said. \"My father he take care of his life.\" E-mail to a friend.", "Q": ["Q: what is Bin's first name?

{"article": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- From ancient Phoenician galleys to 21st century super yachts, a lot has changed about the way people travel the high seas over the centuries.  The Mirabella V, built in 2003, is the world's biggest single-masted sailing yacht, with a mast that is nearly 300 ft tall.  Whether it's one intrepid \"micro-yachtsman\" navigating the Atlantic in a boat the size of a bathtub, or an elite racing team shattering world records in a state-of-the-art catamaran, these voyages all have one thing in common: they have altered the way mankind looks at the world.  MainSail takes a look at the ships, and the revolutionaries they carried on their way.  Voyage of the Beagle  When: 1831 Who: Naturalist Charles Darwin Where: Galapagos Islands The boat: The HMS Beagle was a 90 ft, 10-gun former British Navy warship built in 1820. The ship was repurposed and commissioned for civilian exploration voyages in 1825. How long: Five years Legacy: Aboard the HMS Beagle, Darwin collected specimens and began to develop his theories of evolution, which would later crystallize in \"The Origin of Species.\"  Columbus discovers the New World  When: 1492 Who: Italian explorer Christopher Columbus Where: From Spain to the Caribbean The boats: The Santa Maria was a 70 ft, three-masted ship built from pine and oak, that could carry 40 men. The Nina and the Pinta were both smaller, nimbler boats with triangle-shaped masts better for navigating tricky waterways. The square-sail Santa Maria ran aground in modern-day Haiti on Christmas Day 1492. Legacy: Searching for a new way into the East Indies spice route, it was aboard these three ships that Columbus unintentionally discovered the Caribbean.  'Micro-yachtsman' crosses the Atlantic in miniature boat  When: 1993 Who: American Hugo Vihlen Where: Across the North Atlantic, from Newfoundland to Cornwall, England The boat: The Father's Day, the world's tiniest sailboat at a length of 5 ft 4 in, was so small that Vihlen had to roll up into a ball to sleep, and couldn't stand up without opening the hatch and risk taking on water. Likened to a space shuttle, the boat is made from fiberglass-enclosed Airex foam and was fitted with GPS, a water maker, VHF radio and SSB/Ham radio. Legacy: Aboard the Father's Day, Vihlen became the world's first \"micro-yachtsman,\" but it wasn't all smooth sailing -- the boat was surrounded by whales, nearly capsized, and caught the tail end of a hurricane during its 105-day voyage. What world-changing voyages would you add to our list? Sound Off below  Magellan navigates Cape Horn  When: 1519 Who: Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan Where: Around the world bypassing Cape Horn, South America via a narrow strait The boat: Given to Magellan by King Charles I of Spain, The Victoria was the only one of five ships to complete the trip successfully. Only 18 of its original 237 crew members survived and the ship was so badly damaged it was only kept afloat by the crew continuously pumping water out of the hull. How long: Three years Legacy: During the first ever circumnavigation of the world Magellan discovered a shortcut through a waterway in the southern tip of Chile, which helped sailors to avoid the almost continuous ocean storms off Cape Horn. The voyage also established the need for an international date line -- as the explorers found upon return that their calendars were one day off.  Pilgrims sail to Plymouth Rock  When: 1620 Who: The Pilgrims Where: From England to Plymouth Rock The boat: Primarily used as a cargo ship, in this instance the Mayflower, which was estimated to be between 90 and 110 ft, was used to transport 102 English separatists. How long: Two months Legacy: Half the Pilgrims died during the first winter on the Mayflower, but, in America, the ship continues to be a symbol of the bold English separatists who would encounter great hardships while they explored, and established colonies the modern-day U.S. east coast.  Cook charts the Pacific  When: 1772-1775, 1778-1780 Who: English cartographer and explorer Captain James Cook Where: Pacific Ocean, Antarctic Circle The boat: Called \"the fittest ship for service I have ever seen\" by Cook, the HMS Resolution was fitted with the most advanced technology of the day, including an \"Azimuth compass,\" an ice anchor, a fresh water distiller, and 24 guns and small cannons. How long: Five years  Legacy: Cook charted maps of the Pacific so accurate that many were still used up until 50 years ago, and proved the nonexistence of the mythical \"Terra Australis\" continent believed to exist in the south Pacific. In the process, the HMS Resolution became the first ship to cross the Antarctic Circle.  First solo circumnavigation of the globe  When: 1895 Who: Canadian sailor Joshua Slocum Where: From Boston to Rhode Island The boat: Given as a gift to Slocum in 1892, the rotting 36 ft vessel, The Spray, the sailor restored it for \"$553.62, and 13 months of my own labor.\" How long: Three years Legacy: Slocum became the first person in history to successfully circumnavigate the world solo upon his return to Rhode Island in June 1898, inspiring generations of sailors to come.  Yacht with tallest mast ever sets sail  When: Built in 2003 Who: Owned by American Joe Vittoria, former CEO of Avis Where: From Portsmouth, England to the Mediterranean Sea The boat: With an overall length of 247 ft, the Mirabella V is the largest single-masted boat in the world. The super-yacht's unprecedented mast extends up nearly 300 ft into the sky, and its main sail is over 16,000 sq ft -- the biggest in the world. Legacy: No expense was spared in the construction of Vittoria's luxurious yacht, which cost over $50 million to build. The Mirabella V spends her winters in the Carribean, her summers in the Mediterranean, and can be rented for around $400,000 per week -- but one tip: there isn't a single bridge in the world that the yacht can sail underneath.  Phoenicians build empire on the seas  When: 1200-600 B.C. Who: Expert sailors of Phoenicia's maritime empire Where: Mediterranean Sea The boats: The Phoenicians improved upon the galley -- the ancient ship powered by rows of human oarsmen -- by inventing the \"bireme,\" a galley propelled by a second row of oars. Legacy: Through their skillful use ships to trade valuable Tyrian purple dyes, the seafaring Phoenicians -- who could be considered the world's first \"global capitalists\" -- built a maritime empire from Spain to the Middle East that dominated commercial trade in the Mediterranean for the better part of a millennium.  Fastest circumnavigation of the globe  When: 2005 Who: French yachtsman Bruno Peyron Where: Around the world The boat: The Orange II, a 121 ft \"maxicat,\" a catamaran designed for ocean racing, with super heavy-duty sails that can withstand prolonged exposure to heavy winds. How long: 50 days, 16 hours, 20 minutes and four seconds Legacy: The Orange II shattered the previous world record for the fastest circumnavigation of the globe by nearly eight days -- and Peyron and his 12-man crew currently hold the Jules Verne Trophy, the prize given to the world's fastest circumnavigators.", "Q": ["Q: Who crossed the Atlantic in a micro yacht?

{"article": "ORLANDO, Florida (CNN) -- The meter reader who led authorities last week to remains believed to be those of Caylee Anthony called police four months ago, directing them three times to same site, authorities said Thursday.  Caylee Anthony, 2, has been missing since June in a case that has received national attention.  At a news conference, Capt. Angelo Nieves, an Orange County Sheriff's Department commander, said investigators are looking into whether the tips, called in August 11, 12 and 13, were properly followed up.  In one of those phone calls, the meter reader reported seeing a gray bag on the side of the road, Nieves said. On August 13, a deputy responded to the site and did a \"cursory search\" but found nothing, Nieves said.  Casey Anthony, 22, faces charges including first-degree murder in the June disappearance of her daughter, Caylee, who was 2 at the time. Remains described as being those of a small child were found last week a half-mile from Casey Anthony's parents' home, in the area where the meter reader first directed police.  Nieves said police were getting more information from the tipster and the deputy who responded to the tips. He said the department was investigating the \"thoroughness\" of the deputy's response but would not identify the deputy.  The meter reader \"is not a suspect,\" Nieves said. \"He is a credible witness.\"  Nieves' latest announcement is raising questions about whether police missed several chances to find remains believed to be Caylee's.  The meter reader is not the only one, or the first, to have pointed police toward the site containing the remains.  KioMarie Cruz, Casey Anthony's childhood friend, also told police to investigate the same wooded area near Hidden Oaks Elementary School a month before the meter reader, according to CNN affiliate WFTV.  In an interview with detectives, according to WFTV, Cruz said that she and Anthony \"pretty much used to hang out there most of our time,\" would \"snack on food for hours\" and went there to \"get away from our parents.\"  The sheriff's office followed up on that tip, but the wooded area was covered in floodwaters, preventing a search. Nieves said the water may have been present at the time of the meter reader's tips as well.  Nieves also said Thursday that searchers combing the site after the skull's discovery had found \"significant skeletal remains\" consistent with those of a small child on the outer perimeter of the search area.  The area will be enlarged, and processing and searching of the site will continue, probably into the weekend, he said.  Some of the remains have been sent to the FBI lab in Quantico, Virginia, in an effort to identify them. Authorities have said the remains are believed to be Caylee's, but an identification is pending.  Sheriff's spokesman Carlos Padilla said last week that authorities believe the remains are Caylee's for three reasons: No other children have been reported missing in the area; the remains are consistent with those of a child of Caylee's age; and the remains were found near the home of the grandparents, where the 2-year-old and her mother were living just before Caylee disappeared.  FBI spokesman Richard Kolko said Monday that he did not know when tests would be complete, but an attorney for Anthony's parents said the FBI is likely to have results \"within the next week.\"  Casey Anthony could face a sentence of life in prison if convicted.

{"article": "  -- The Tennis Channel has canceled plans to broadcast a tournament in Dubai because an Israeli player was banned.  Israeli tennis player Shahar Peer was denied a visa by the United Arab Emirates.  Shahar Peer, the 45th-ranked women's player according to the World Tennis Association, qualified to compete in this week's Barclays Dubai Tennis Championships but was denied a visa by the United Arab Emirates. Dubai is one of the seven emirates of the UAE.  The cable network had planned to air parts of the tournament this weekend.  \"Tennis Channel recognizes that this exclusion has been made by state authorities and neither the tour nor tournament directors themselves,\" said a statement posted on the channel's Web site Wednesday. \"However we also honor the role and proud tradition that tennis has always played as a driving force for inclusion both on and off the courts.  \"Preventing an otherwise qualified athlete from competing on the basis of anything other than merit has no place in tennis or any other sport, and has the unfortunate result of undermining the credibility of the very nature of competition itself.\"  The announcement comes the same day The Wall Street Journal Europe announced it is dropping its sponsorship of the tournament.  \"The Wall Street Journal's editorial philosophy is free markets and free people, and this action runs counter to the Journal's editorial direction,\" the Journal said in a written statement.  The paper also said it plans to cancel a special tennis-themed advertising section scheduled for Monday and its backing of a men's tournament in Dubai scheduled for next week.  After days of international criticism, including the WTA saying it would review whether the UAE should be allowed to host future tournaments, the event's organizers said Peer was barred from the tournament for her own protection, apparently alluding to Israel's recent military offensive in Gaza.  \"We do not wish to politicize sports, but we have to be sensitive to recent events in the region and not alienate or put at risk the players and the many tennis fans of different nationalities that we have here,\" organizers said in a written statement.  The statement cited anti-Israel protests before one of Peer's matches at a recent tournament in New Zealand.  But this is not the first time the UAE has barred Israeli tennis players. Last year, an Israeli men's doubles team was denied entry. The emirate also cited security concerns then.  In a statement posted on the Tennis Channel's site, Peer thanked the cable channel for its decision.  \"I was very moved and excited to hear about your decision not to broadcast the Dubai tournament following their denial to allow me to participate in the event,\" she wrote. \"You at Tennis Channel were the first ones to add action to the words and this is leading the way to other organizations as well.  \"All I want is to play tennis and do well.

{"article": "(Budget Travel) -- It's all the rage to criticize the airlines. But we found some smart, practical initiatives that point the way to a better future.  This test design for Personal Rapid Transit is part of plans for driverless pods to replace airport shuttles.  Driverless pods at airports  Someday, driverless pods may be zipping passengers between an airport and its parking lots. Fully automated, pods are more convenient than shuttle buses driven by humans. Currently, 18 pods are being tested at London Heathrow's Terminal 5. They let you board when you want to, rather than wait for a bus on a fixed schedule. Punch in your destination, such as a parking lot, on a touch screen. Then leave the driving to the machine, which glides on rails at speeds of 25 mph. A bonus perk: The pods are battery powered, so they don't spew out environmentally destructive exhaust.  Improved design of coach seats  Hong Kong based Cathay Pacific Airways has reinvented the economy-class seat: As the seat reclines, the bottom slides forward, but the back stays in place. So the passenger sitting behind doesn't have to endure a seat hovering inches from his or her chin. The new seats are especially welcome on long-distance hauls -- which happen to be routes Cathay Pacific flies regularly. American Airlines is among the other carriers reportedly interested in installing similar, slide-forward seats.  In-cabin mood lighting  Poor cabin lighting on a long flight may worsen jet lag. For instance, exposure to bright light at an hour when you are ordinarily asleep can confuse your body's internal clock. But smart cabin lighting may actually help your body adjust to a new time zone -- and beat back jet lag. Virgin America has an in-cabin lighting system that subtly shifts through 12 shades of violet, including a welcoming, bright blue-purple during the day, a softer violet hue after dusk, and a deep, calming near-black on red-eyes when it's time to sleep. Elsewhere in the world, Air Canada, Malaysia Airlines, Singapore Airlines, and Thai Airways offer mood lighting on many long-haul flights.  Luggage check before you get to the airport  Schlepping your bags isn't fun. It's also not necessary -- at least not in the many capital cities where you can drop checked luggage at bus or train stations and forget about it until you land at your destination. Many passengers can check bags at London's Paddington station (for Heathrow flights), Vienna's Wien Mitte station, Moscow's Kievsky Station, and Hong Kong Station. In the U.S., the best advance luggage-check option is at Walt Disney World: Guests staying at Disney lodging can check bags at their hotel before hopping on the free Magical Express ride to the Orlando airport.  Paperless boarding passes  Boarding passes printed on flimsy paper seem almost as outdated as paper airline tickets. Now, cell phone check-in is allowed at many airports, such as Chicago O'Hare and Los Angeles's LAX. Punch in your phone number at check-in and a bar code appears on your phone via e-mail or text message. Security officers and gate agents scan your phone's screen, making for an entirely paperless process. Some airlines, including American, Continental, and Delta (plus its sister unit, Northwest), plan to adopt the new technology at every airport gate nationwide.  More power --sockets -- for the people  Sometimes it's the simple things that count. Virgin America not only became the first airline to offer Wi-Fi on every flight, but it did so in an especially sensible way, with standard sockets (no adapter necessary) at every seat on the plane. Because while Wi-Fi is nice (even when there's a fee for it), it's even nicer to know that you won't run out of juice in the middle of a flight. Sockets obviously work with portable DVD players and cell phone chargers, too.  Replacements for outmoded radar-tracking systems  Radar is outdated. Locating a plane's position can take up to half a minute, a long time when planes are traveling at speeds over 500 mph. To play it safe and avoid accidents, planes fly extremely far apart from each other. They also fly routes that zigzag rather than go straight. The reason? Aircraft need to remain within signal range of radar beacons, which are irregularly spaced around the country. To shave flight times -- and improve safety -- the FAA is rolling out NextGen, a GPS-based air traffic control system that provides real-time plane locations to pilots and air traffic controllers. Using GPS technology (already in trial use by Alaska Airlines), planes will be able to fly straighter, more efficient routes while maintaining a safe distance from other aircraft. But we may have to wait until 2025 to see this technology adopted nationwide. Sigh.  Easier upgrades  With most airlines, upgrading is an esoteric process that may involve loyalty program points, elite status, or just dumb luck. But when you check in at the airport for a Spirit Airlines flight, the kiosk presents a simpler formula. The screen may inform you that one of Spirit's Big Front Seats (the carrier's version of business class) is available for as little as $35 extra. The roomy seats are often dispensed on a first-come, first-served basis close to departure time. Depending on how you're feeling that day, you may very well decide that an upgrade to a more comfortable seat is money well spent.  Copyright 2009. Newsweek Budget Travel, Inc.

{"article": "CRAWFORD, Texas (CNN) -- Anti-war activist Cindy Sheehan doesn't come around President Bush's ranch any more, but there's a new kid in town trying to get his attention.  Peace activist Alix Bryan traveled 11,000 miles to President Bush's ranch in Crawford, Texas.  Peace activist Alix Bryan, 33, arrived near the ranch here on Saturday afternoon aboard a motor scooter that goes about 55 miles per hour -- on 12-inch wheels.  She drove the scooter from the White House to a home in Crawford dubbed by anti-war activists as the \"Peace House,\" mapping out a circuitous route that formed a peace sign.  Sheehan used to frequent the house.  Bryan bears little resemblance to Sheehan, a California woman who gained national attention as a protest leader after her son Casey was killed fighting in Iraq.  Sheehan's loss prompted her to camp near Bush's home in Crawford throughout August 2005, demanding a meeting with the president to discuss her son. Bush refused to see her, and she abandoned her protests in Texas last year.  Bryan's odyssey took three months. She journeyed more than 11,000 miles braving elements ranging from rain to wind and even one speeding ticket (which she says she talked her way out of). ( Watch Bryan arrive in Crawford \u00bb)  \"I had my moments actually where I was just exhausted, I mean it's draining,\" Bryan said upon her arrival in Crawford. \"I've ridden in heat from 105 degrees to temperatures (as low as) 40 degrees.\"  Bryan blogged about the trip on the Web site of Rep. Dennis Kucinich, D-Ohio, the liberal presidential candidate, and sustained herself with donations to her own site, www.peacescooter.com.  Bryan said she always planned to end her trip in Crawford and hoped to arrive on September 15 after hitting the road from the White House in July. But weather delays and running out of gas once delayed her arrival in Texas until this weekend, when Bush happens to be spending time at his ranch.  While the odds of landing a meeting with the president are remote at best, Bryan said if she had the chance she would like to start a dialogue of peace based on the conversations she had with Americans along the way.  \"I would say even those who voted for Bush do not support this war,\" she said.  But the large crowds of antiwar activists that followed Sheehan around Crawford in the summer of 2005 have long since vanished.  A \"rally\" at the Peace House to celebrate Bryan's arrival drew just a handful of antiwar activists. Nevertheless, Bryan said she was not defeated.  \"Calm seas,\" she said, \"don't make good sailors.\" E-mail to a friend.", "Q": ["Q: What did Bryan ride for more than 11,000 miles?

The student's admission came the day after police were alerted to the presence of the noose in a library bookcase at the school.

In a crime alert bulletin, police said they received several reports Thursday around 10:30 p.m. of the noose on the seventh floor of the Geisel Library. It was found hanging in an aisle facing windows.  \"Officers spoke with people who were in the area, but no one witnessed the noose being placed on the bookcase,\" police said in a campus notice.  Hanging a noose with intent to terrorize is a crime, it noted.  On Friday, the school announced several measures it was taking in response to recommendations from its Black Student Union. They include the establishment of a task force on minority faculty recruitment, a new commission to addressing declining African-American enrollment and finding space for an African-American resource center.  \"I want to emphasize these are the initial steps, and I realize we have a lot of work ahead of us,\" Fox said.

{"article": "  -- The American Civil Liberties Union is pushing for a quick legal decision, hoping to save a high school prom that was allegedly canceled because two lesbians wanted to attend it together.  The rights group filed a motion for a preliminary injunction against a Mississippi school district and high school in federal court Tuesday over the April 2 prom.  The case will be argued before a federal judge in Mississippi on March 22, the ACLU said.  The showdown stems from a complaint by 18-year-old Constance McMillen, who said she was told not to bring her girlfriend to the prom or wear a tuxedo.  The prom was canceled after the ACLU demanded that McMillen's high school change its policy.  \"I never thought the school would try to cancel the prom and hurt everyone just to keep me and my girlfriend from going together,\" McMillen said in an ACLU news release. \"A lot of people have made really generous offers to pay for a prom somewhere else, which I really appreciate. But all I've ever wanted was to be able to just go to my own school's prom with my girlfriend.\"  The motion filed Tuesday is part of a lawsuit that the ACLU has filed against the Itawamba County School District and Itawamba Agricultural High School.  At the center of the lawsuit is a memorandum from the school to students, dated February 5, which says that prom dates must be of the opposite sex.  Also, when McMillen expressed a desire to wear a tuxedo to the prom, the district superintendent told her only male students were allowed to wear them, according to court documents.  Superintendent Teresa McNeece also told McMillen that she and her girlfriend could be ejected from the prom if other students complained about their presence, according to the documents.  School district officials could not be reached for comment.

{"article": " -- Former \"Manson Family\" member Susan Atkins, who stabbed actress Sharon Tate to death more than 40 years ago and now is terminally ill, was denied parole Wednesday, prison officials said.  Susan Atkins, shown here after her indictment in the Manson murders, was denied parole again Wednesday.  The parole hearing was the 13th for Atkins, 61, who is battling terminal brain cancer. Held at the Central California Women's Facility in Chowchilla, California, the hearing stretched to more than six hours.  The panel set another hearing for Atkins in three years, said Michele Kane, spokeswoman for the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.  Atkins was 21 when she and other followers of Charles Manson participated in a two-night rampage that left seven people dead and terrorized the city of Los Angeles in August 1969. She and the others -- Manson, Leslie Van Houten, Patricia Krenwinkel and Charles \"Tex\" Watson -- were initially sentenced to death in the slayings of five people, including Tate, and two additional deaths the following night.  Their sentences were automatically commuted to life in prison when the Supreme Court struck down the nation's death penalty laws in 1972.  Watch Atkins, victims' kin speak \u00bb  By her own admission, Atkins, known as Sadie Mae Glutz within the Manson family, held Tate down as she pleaded for mercy, and stabbed the actress 16 times. Tate was eight months pregnant. In a 1993 parole board hearing, Atkins said Tate \"asked me to let her baby live.... I told her I didn't have any mercy on her.\"  After killing Tate, according to historical accounts of the slayings, Atkins scrawled the word \"pig\" in blood on the door of the home Tate shared with her husband, director Roman Polanski. Polanski was not home, but three of Tate's house guests were also slain by the killers, as was a teenager who was visiting the home's caretaker in his nearby cottage.  In an interview scheduled to air Friday on CNN's \"Larry King Live,\" Linda Kasabian, a former Manson follower who was the prosecution's star witness against Manson and Atkins, recounted the Tate slayings.  Watch Kasabian recall killings \u00bb  \"I started hearing like horrible screaming and I started running toward the house and Sadie came running out and I just looked at her and I said, 'Sadie, please make it stop,'\" Kasabian said. \"And she said, 'I can't. It's too late.'... It was unreal. It was so real that it was unreal.\"  On whether she asked Atkins and the others why they were killing, Kasabian said, \"It wasn't that kind of a scenario. All that I said was, 'Sadie, make it stop.'\"  For her safety, Kasabian asked to wear a disguise during the interview, which was conducted last month.  As of earlier this year, Atkins was paralyzed over 85 percent of her body and could not sit up in bed or be moved into a wheelchair, according to a Web site maintained by her husband and attorney, James Whitehouse. She has been described as a model prisoner who has accepted responsibility for her role in the slayings and now shuns Manson.  But Tate's sister, Debra Tate, told CNN in an e-mail in March that she does not think any Manson family member convicted of murder should ever be set free, saying the slayings were \"so vicious, so inhumane, so depraved, that there is no turning back.\"  \"The 'Manson Family' murderers are sociopaths, and from that, they can never be rehabilitated,\" Tate said. \"They should all stay right where they are -- in prison -- until they die. There will never be true justice for my sister Sharon and the other victims of the 'Manson Family.' Keeping the murderers in prison is the least we, as a society who values justice, can do.\"  In a manuscript posted on her Web site, Atkins wrote that \"this is the past I have to live with, and I have to live with it every day.\"  \"Unlike the reader, or the people who seem to think Charles Manson was cool, I can't think about it for an hour or so and then go on with my life. Just like the families and friends of the victims, this is with me every day. I have to wake up every day with this and, no matter what I do for the rest of my life and no matter how much I give back to the community, I will never be able to replace what my crime took away. And that's not 'neat,' and that's not 'cool.'\"  Atkins' brain cancer was diagnosed in March 2008, Whitehouse wrote on his Web site. On May 15, doctors predicted she would live less than six months. But she passed that deadline, he wrote, and celebrated her 21st wedding anniversary on December 7.", "Q": ["Q: How many years until another hearing for Atkins?

{"article": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Bush signed an executive order Friday expanding U.S. sanctions against Zimbabwe, the White House said.  About 200 victims of election violence seek safety outside the U.S. Embassy in Harare, Zimbabwe, this month.  \"The new executive order significantly enhances our ability to designate individuals in and entities connected to the Mugabe regime,\" Bush said in a written statement that calls the Zimbabwean government under president Robert Mugabe \"illegitimate.\"  Just after the announcement, the Treasury Department said it has designated for sanctions 17 entities, including three government-owned or controlled companies used by Mugabe and his government \"to illegally siphon revenue and foreign exchange from the Zimbabwean people,\" as well as one individual.  \"This action is a direct result of the Mugabe regime's continued politically motivated violence, disregarding calls from the Southern African Development Community, the African Union and the United Nations to halt the attacks,\" the White House said.  \"The regime has also continued its ban against NGO activities that would provide assistance to the suffering and vulnerable people of Zimbabwe. No regime should ignore the will of its own people and calls from the international community without consequences.\"  The U.S. has been pushing for sanctions against Zimbabwe since Mugabe ignored a U.N. Security Council appeal to postpone a presidential runoff election June 27. The vote initially was intended to be a runoff between Mugabe and opposition candidate Morgan Tsvangirai, who did not win the presidency outright in the general election, according to government tallies.  But Tsvangirai, of the Movement for Democratic Change, withdrew just before the vote, saying Mugabe's supporters had orchestrated a campaign of beatings, intimidation and murders against Tsvangirai supporters.  Earlier this month, Russia and China vetoed a Security Council resolution pushed by the United States, Britain and France that would have imposed international sanctions on Mugabe and senior members of his government. Bush said last week he was \"displeased\" at the vetoes, but the Treasury and State Departments were working on potential U.S. action.  Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Jendayi Frazer told members of Congress last week that more than 100 people have been murdered, more than 3,000 have been injured by beatings or torture and more than 30,000 have been driven from their homes because of violence that broke out after the general election.  Entities designated by the Treasury Department include Minerals Marketing Corp. of Zimbabwe, the company that serves as the sole marketing and export agent for all minerals mined in Zimbabwe except gold and silver; Zimbabwe Mining Development Corp.; and Zimbabwe Iron and Steel Co., among others.  The individual named is Thamer Bin Saeed Ahmed al-Shanfari. The Treasury Department said he is an Omani national who has close ties to Mugabe and his top officials and uses his company, Oryx Natural Resources, to \"enable Mugabe... to maintain access to, and derive personal benefit from, various mining ventures in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  Under the sanctions, any assets tied to al-Shanfari or to the designated companies that are within U.S. jurisdictions must be frozen, and people living in the United States are prohibited from doing business with them.  On Monday, Mugabe and Tsvangirai signed an agreement that paves the way for power-sharing talks to take place in the next few weeks. They will be mediated by South African President Thabo Mbeki, as a representative of the Southern African Development Community, and Jean Ping, chairman of the African Union Commission.  Bush said Friday the United States is ready to provide a \"substantial assistance package, development aid and normalization with international financial institutions\" should those talks result in a new government \"that reflects the will of the Zimbabwean people.\"  In the meantime, the president said he is authorizing the use of up to $2.5 million from the U.S. Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance Fund to assist Zimbabwean refugees and those displaced by the violence. In addition, he said the United States will continue efforts to provide food and medical care to Zimbabweans.", "Q": ["Q: Mugabe and Tsvangirai have signed agreement paving way for what?

{"article": "NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- Tibetan exile leaders, meeting in northern India to debate a potential new approach to Tibet's decades-long struggle for autonomy, have voted to stay with the Dalai Lama's current \"middle way approach,\" according to a spokesman for the spiritual leader.  Some have sought Tibet's independence from China, but the Dalai Lama has sought autonomy.  \"The majority of the people have spoken and have requested his holiness the Dalai Lama to continue with his middle way approach,\" said spokesman Tenzin Taklha.  The meeting was called after the Dalai Lama acknowledged he had failed in his efforts to convince China to restore the territory's autonomy. He did not attend the week-long conference in Dharamsala, a town in the hills of north India where he lives in exile. He called the meeting, he said, to offer the exiles an opportunity to discuss \"the best possible future course of action\" for Tibet.  Takhla said the Tibetans demonstrated that the Dalai Lama was their undisputed leader, and they hoped China would recognize him as such and negotiations toward a realistic solution could be held.  There was a small minority who said they wanted to demand Tibet's independence, Takhla said.  The \"middle way\" approach with Beijing is one in which Tibetans want a level of autonomy that will allow them to protect and preserve their culture, religion and national identity. In exchange, China could continue to claim Tibet as part of its territory.  Some in Tibet have advocated independence from China, but the Dalai Lama has long called for genuine autonomy.  Tibet is technically autonomous from the central Chinese government, but the Dalai Lama and others have said they favor real autonomy and resent the slow erosion of their culture amid an influx of Han Chinese, the largest ethnic group in China.  Learn about Tibet's history of conflict \u00bb  The resentment spilled over in March, when Buddhist monks initiated peaceful anti-Chinese protests in the Tibetan capital of Lhasa. The demonstrations began March 14, the anniversary of a failed 1959 uprising against Beijing's rule that sent the Dalai Lama into exile.  The protests soon turned violent, with demonstrators burning vehicles and shops. Some protesters advocated independence from China, while others demonstrated against the growing influence of the Han Chinese in Tibet and other regions of China with ethnic Tibetan populations. The subsequent crackdown left 18 civilians and one police officer dead, according to the Chinese government. Tibet's self-proclaimed government-in-exile put the death toll from the protests at 140.  China blamed the Dalai Lama and his followers for the March riots -- a charge he has consistently denied.", "Q": ["Q: Who did they back? A:", "Q: Who wnated Tibet's independence?

The police dogs in Duesseldorf, Germany are now patrolling the pavement in protective shoes that their police-officer handlers strap onto their paws.  The reason? Too many glass shards left by beer drinkers in the city center, said Andre Hartwich, a spokesman for police in Duesseldorf.  \"We wondered how can we protect our dogs' feet against glass,\" said Hartwich. \"We looked on the Internet and found these shoes.\"  Beer drinkers along the Rhine River and in the city's Altstadt, or Old Town, often discard beer bottles on pebbled walkways. Broken glass poses a problem for the police force's 20 German Shepherds and Belgian Shepherds, Hartwich said.  In addition, hooligans and vandals leave behind glass shards around New Year's Eve and during the city's famous Carnival celebrations.  So what's a dog to do?

{"article": " -- An estimated 1 million people turned out to hear Pope Benedict XVI preach a Mass in Angola on Sunday, the last major event of his first trip to Africa.  Pope Benedict XVI celebrates Mass in Angola, where he told Angolans on Sunday to \"trust in God's promises.\"  He spoke of the need for reconciliation in a country that endured a brutal civil war lasting nearly three decades.  \"Look to the future with hope, trust in God's promises and live in his truth. In this way you will build something that will stand and endure... a lasting heritage of reconciliation, justice and peace,\" Benedict said in English to polite applause.  The service's Bible reading's \"vivid description of the destruction wrought by war echoes the personal experiences of so many people in this country amid the terrible ravages of the civil war,\" Benedict said in the Mass, which was broadcast by TPA, a CNN affiliate in Angola.  \"How true it is that war can destroy everything of value: families, whole communities, the fruit of men's labor.\"  Benedict also expressed \"deep sorrow\" at the death of two women killed in a stampede at one of his events in Angola on Saturday, papal spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said.  Cardinal Tarciso Bertone, the Vatican secretary of state, earlier led a Vatican delegation to the hospitals where the bodies of two dead women are being kept, Lombardi said. They prayed over the dead bodies and met with the family of the one victim who has been identified, a catechism teacher in a parish in Luanda whose last class was Saturday morning.  Midway through the Mass, a long line of worshippers brought offerings to the pontiff, as an electric organ and guitar played a joyous tune over the sound of percussion instruments and a choir, members of which were wearing matching white baseball caps. Women carried local produce on their heads in wide baskets or tall jugs, many dancing to the music as they waited to meet the pope.  The 81-year-old pontiff mopped his face with a white handkerchief several times during the outdoor service, while many worshippers sought shelter from the sun under umbrellas.  The pope spoke in English and Portuguese, the language of Angola's former colonial rulers, during the hour-long service, while local clergy read short passages in tribal languages.  Benedict has been in Africa since Tuesday. He returns to Rome on Monday.  Africa is the last continent that Benedict had left to visit, and one he could not avoid, said David Gibson, a biographer of the pope.  \"He knows he has to do this. He knows Africa is the future of the [Roman Catholic] Church, as it is for all of Christianity,\" said Gibson. Christianity, like Islam, is on the rise in Africa and Latin America, even as the northern hemisphere tends to become more secular.  One in five of the world's Christians lives in Africa -- up from fewer than one in 50 in 1900, said Brian Grim, an editor of the World Religion Database.  So Benedict is making the visit, although travel \"is not his cup of tea,\" Gibson said, in contrast to his predecessor. \"John Paul II loved the travel and loved the different cultures. Benedict is a European through and through.\"  But Benedict understands that travel has become an essential part of a pope's duties, said Gibson, the author of \"The Rule of Benedict: Pope Benedict XVI and His Battle with the Modern World.\"  The trip opened with controversy, with the pope reiterating the Vatican's opposition to artificial birth control Tuesday while flying to Cameroon, the first stop on his journey.  Sub-Saharan Africa has been hit harder by AIDS and HIV than any other region of the world, according to the United Nations and World Health Organization. There has been fierce debate between those who advocate the use of condoms to help stop the spread of the epidemic and those who oppose it.  Gibson said this week's visit may be Benedict's only trip to Africa.  \"Knowing that the pope is older, he cannot travel as much -- he does not like to travel -- makes these trips more poignant. He may never come back to Africa again.\"  CNN's Hada Messia in Rome contributed to this report.", "Q": ["Q: Where did 1 million gather? A:", "Q: What is the name of the Pope?

{"article": " -- Golf was considered a sport of the capitalist elite and banned in Eastern Europe under the rule of communist regimes -- but in the 20 years since the Berlin Wall has fallen there has been a renaissance of the game in the region.  Gary Player has overseen the development of two courses on the Black Sea coast in Bulgaria.  With rising disposable income and an increasing interest in leisure pursuits, a growing number of courses, more television coverage and availability of EU funds, the future of the industry in Eastern Europe is bright.  Bulgaria is one country where the sport is on the up. Eight years ago there were no golf courses but --to fulfil the increasing domestic demand and as a means to attract tourists to the region -- the country could be set for a  boom in golf development.  Kancho Stoychev, vice president of Bulgarian Golf, believes that despite there being only 200 registered players in a country whose population is eight million there is set to be an explosion of interest in the sport.  See CNN's Justin Armsden's report on the development of golf in Eastern Europe. \u00bb  \"It is an absurdly low figure, but now I believe that there'll be a switch because we have six nice golf courses,\" Stoychev told CNN.  \"We can already see there is a high increase in interest and it'll evolve quite quickly.  \"We have some advantages in Bulgaria. We have an excellent coastlines, we are a small country but very diverse, so the country is geographically and naturally perfect for golf.\"  The potential in Eastern Europe has also been recognized by golf legend Gary Player, whose course design company has been working on projects in the region.  Having just opened a course in Poland, Player's design company is building two more in Bulgaria - BlackSeaRama which is already open, and Thracian Cliffs which is scheduled to be finished by July 2010.  Player told CNN: \"You want to take golf to new areas, like Poland, you want to bring it to Bulgaria, where people never thought that they could play golf where people associated golf with just rich people.  \"You can play down here along the ocean and ten minutes up the mountain you have a links course, which is the complete opposite, people who love golf will be in for a golfing treat.\"  The knock-on effect of the presence of a high-profile name such as Player in the region ensures it has caught the eye of influential figures within the industry.

{"article": "NEW YORK (CNN) -- After arguing with her husband, Liza Murphy walked out of their home in Emerson, New Jersey, leaving behind her purse, her cigarettes, her cell phone and her three children, her husband told police. There has been no sign of her since August 19, 2007.  Liza Murphy has been missing from her home in Emerson, New Jersey, since August 19, 2007.  Murphy's friends and family reported her missing the next day.  \"In my heart, I fear the worst, that my daughter is gone,\" said her mother, Sophia Stellatos.  Police searched extensively for Murphy, especially around a reservoir not far from her home, but they found nothing. Cadaver dogs caught her scent near the George Washington Bridge, but the trail went cold, police told the family.  Deepening the mystery, her husband, Joe Murphy, tried to take his own life a few days after his wife disappeared by walking into oncoming traffic and throwing himself in front of a fire truck, police say.  He was hospitalized and recovered from his injuries, but police say he hired a lawyer and is no longer cooperating with investigators.  His lawyer said Murphy, an Irish immigrant, has nothing to hide from the authorities. He said his client has no criminal record and no history of violence. Attorney Joseph Rem added that there was no physical violence in the marriage.  According to her family, Liza Murphy, 42, was not the type of person to take off on her own without letting her family know.  Watch an update \u00bb  \"She would never leave her three children behind voluntarily,\" her mother insisted.  \"What doesn't make sense is Liza leaving her house without her purse, cell phone, wallet, keys or cigarettes,\" she added. \"She was a heavy smoker, and if she took off after a fight for a walk to cool off, she definitely wouldn't leave without her cigarettes!\"  Liza Murphy and her husband were having marital problems, her family said. Stellatos described Joe Murphy as possessive of his wife, never allowing her to go out with her friends. She said he was even jealous if she spent time with her parents.  Rem pointed out that his client has not been named as a suspect or a person of interest in the case. He said police have not asked to speak to his client recently.  Liza Murphy's children are 15, 13 and 10 years old now. Joe Murphy has full custody of them, and the Stellatoses have not seen their grandchildren since shortly before their daughter disappeared.  Murphy and her children had spent the week before her disappearance visiting with her parents, who live about 125 miles away. They returned the Friday before Murphy's disappearance.  Police say both the Murphy home and their vehicles have been processed for forensics, but they found no evidence of foul play or struggle.  Liza Murphy had been suffering from depression and was on medication for fibromyalgia, a painful condition that affects the muscles and soft tissues. Police say she may have been accosted after she left home, still stewing over the argument.  The police seek the public's help in this case.

{"article": " -- The Mexican military has arrested a suspect in the killings this month of three people with ties to the U.S. Consulate in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, police and federal spokesmen said Monday.  The arrested man is Ricardo Valles de la Rosa, municipal police spokesman Jacinto Seguro said.  According to Juarez newspaper El Diario, the suspect also was sought in connection with at least one other homicide: the killing of Zapata Reyes, a member of the rival Mexicles gang.  Valles de la Rosa reportedly has U.S. ties, having been charged with 10 counts related to drug trafficking in the United States, local media said. The suspect is a resident of la colonia Partido Romero in Ciudad Juarez, the media said, adding that he may rent a place in El Paso.  Federal spokesman Enrique Torres said the suspect was arrested sometime Friday. He did not release a name, but described him as being 42 years old and a member of the Aztecas, a local street gang affiliated with the Juarez drug cartel.  \"The Chihuahua state attorney general is telling us that this guy is implicated in the killings of Arthur Redelfs and his pregnant wife, Lesley [Enriquez],\" Seguro said.  El Diario reported that the suspect was captured with the help of the FBI. An FBI spokesman in El Paso, Texas, had no comment, other than to say that the investigation continues.  The three victims had all been at a party in Juarez and left in two vehicles that looked similar. They were killed on the roads in drive-by shootings.  Enriquez was an employee of the consulate in Juarez and was four months pregnant. Redelfs, her U.S. citizen husband, was a jailer in El Paso. The couple's 10-month-old child, who also was in the vehicle, was not injured.  The third victim, found dead in the other vehicle, was identified as the husband of a Mexican employee of the consulate. His wife was not traveling with him, but two of their children in the car were wounded, officials said.

{"article": " -- Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich was absent again Tuesday from his Senate impeachment trial, but state senators who will decide whether to remove him from office heard him loud and clear on FBI recordings of his phone calls.  Gov. Rod Blagojevich talks to CNN's Campbell Brown Tuesday night about his impeachment trial.  Only four snippets of conversations were played for senators in the second day of the impeachment trial, and all pertained to horse-racing legislation.  Prosecutors said the brief recordings focused on the governor's efforts to apparently raise campaign contributions in exchange for signing a horse-racing bill.  In one recording from December 3, a lobbyist assures the governor that a race-track owner has pledged his \"commitment.\"  \"He goes, 'I hope I'm gonna have it next week, but you have my commitment. I've always been there. I'm gonna be there,' \" the lobbyist told Blagojevich of the race track owner.  None of the recordings mentions money specifically.  Meanwhile, Blagojevich continued an ambitious media blitz, appearing in interviews with CBS, CNN, Fox and The Associated Press. A day earlier, he appeared on CNN's \"Larry King Live,\" ABC's \"Good Morning America\" and \"The View.\"  Watch Blagojevich on \"Larry King Live\" \u00bb  \"I hate all of this,\" Blagojevich told CNN's Campbell Brown in an interview Tuesday. \"This is a life-changing thing. I am about to be thrown out of office for accusations that are false and not true.\"  Watch Brown interview Blagojevich \u00bb  He added, \"But there's principles involved. And that is I did nothing wrong and I'd like an opportunity to prove it.\"  The governor has railed against state Senate rules that restrict the calling of some witnesses and the presentation of some evidence.  State Sen. Matt Murphy, part of the nine-member committee that put the Senate trial rules together, has said U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald asked both sides to \"defer to the criminal prosecution\" of Blagojevich and \"limit witnesses.\" The House prosecution in the Senate trial is operating under the same restrictions, he said.  Senators also heard testimony Tuesday from FBI Special Agent Daniel Cain, author of a 76-page affidavit released in December, when the governor was arrested on federal corruption charges.  Watch proceedings from Tuesday's trial \u00bb  Among other allegations, federal prosecutors said the governor tried to trade or sell the Senate seat that would become vacant after Barack Obama became president.  Cain testified about transcripts of federal tapes in the affidavit, mostly replying in the affirmative when House prosecutor David Ellis asked whether the portions of the affidavit were accurate.  \"In the end, we were very confident that it was the governor's voice in those conversations,\" Cain told House prosecutor David Ellis.  Cain said FBI agents repeatedly listened to the governor's recorded conversations to make sure they were accurate. \"Agents would listen to the recordings repeatedly as many times as necessary to verify the accuracy and quote,\" he said.  Later, as senators tried to ask Cain about the recordings, a representative from the U.S. attorney's office was on hand to block some answers.  After Blagojevich's arrest, the state House impeached the two-term Democratic governor in two votes, with only one dissenting vote each time. The second vote was needed because of the seating of a new House.  Blagojevich has said the House impeachment vote was politically motivated.", "Q": ["Q: Who was absent from the trial?

{"article": " -- Journalist Bob Woodward describes in his new book a secret U.S. program to assassinate terrorists in Iraq.  CNN's Michael Ware says, \"The U.S. subcontracted out an assassination program against al Qaeda... in early 2006.\"  Woodward, an associate editor of The Washington Post, says in \"The War Within: A Secret White House History 2006-2008\" that the assassination program, not the 2007 increase in U.S. forces in the war zone known as \"the surge,\" is primarily responsible for the reduction of violence in Iraq.  CNN Baghdad correspondent Michael Ware cast doubt on Woodward's assertion Tuesday in a conversation with \"American Morning\" host John Roberts.  Watch Larry King on his talk with Woodward \u00bb  John Roberts: What do you think of what Woodward is saying?  Michael Ware: Let's say that these \"fusion teams,\" as they're being called, have come into effect. The first thing to say is, \"Well, about time.\"  On the ground you've seen the lack of coordination as the left hand of one agency is not with the right hand of another agency within the American effort. But by and large, to suggest that anything like this being done now has been the major reason for the decline in violence is a bit rich.  I mean, the U.S. subcontracted out an assassination program against al Qaeda way back in early 2006. And this was conceded by the then-chief of military intelligence in Baghdad and by [U.S.] Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad himself. That's what broke the back of al Qaeda.  Then when America put 100,000-plus insurgents on the U.S. government payroll, including members of al Qaeda, that not only took them out of the field, but it also let them run their own assassination programs against the Iranian-backed militias.  Roberts: So it sounds like assassination was a real part of the program here, but was that the only thing that worked? What about the addition of these troops and these neighborhood stations that were set up? Did it all kind of work together?  Ware: It does work together. But the key to the downturn in violence that we're seeing now is not so much the surge of 30,000 troops in itself.  What it's been is the segregation of Baghdad into these enclaves. It's been cutting a deal with Muqtada al-Sadr, the leader of the Iranian-backed militia. And primarily it's been putting your enemy on your payroll -- the Sunni insurgents and many members of al Qaeda. That's what's brought down the violence. This is your American militia, the counterbalance to the Iranian militias.  So if there's new teams out there with new technology, great. But they're riding the wave of previous success.", "Q": ["Q: Who is CNN's Baghdad correspondent? A:", "Q: What deal is also key? A:", "Q: According to Ware, what had a bigger impact?

{"article": "Washington (CNN) -- The chairman of the Republican Party and a leading GOP senator called on Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to give up his post Sunday, following the publication of remarks he made about President Obama's race in 2008.  A new book quotes Reid, D-Nevada, as saying privately in 2008 that Obama could be successful as a black candidate in part because of his \"light-skinned\" appearance and speaking patterns \"with no Negro dialect, unless he wanted to have one.\"  The remarks were \"embarrassing and racially insensitive,\" said Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, head of the GOP's Senate campaign arm, in a statement to CNN.  GOP Chairman Michael Steele, on NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" said: \"Racism and racist conversations have no place today in America.\"  Steele also was on the defensive for a remark he made last week that members of both parties have called a racial slur. In an interview with Fox News, Steele used the phrase \"honest injun.\"  The Congressional Black Caucus has accepted Reid's apology and is dismissing calls for him to step down as majority leader.  Rep. Barbara Lee, chairwoman of the caucus, issued the following statement: \"I have had an opportunity to speak with Senator Reid and he apologized for his unfortunate remarks concerning the president, and he understands the gravity of such remarks. There are too many issues like the economy, job creation and energy for these regrettable comments to distract us from the work that must be done on behalf of the American people.\"  Democrats also rejected the calls for Reid's dismissal. Gov. Tim Kaine of Virginia, chairman of the Democratic Party, said \"the case is closed\" following Reid's round of apologies.  Douglas Wilder of Virginia, who 20 years ago became the nation's first elected African-American governor, also rejected calls for Reid's ouster.  \"I think that what Reid was giving was a personal opinion, which wasn't affecting the laws or the operation of the dispensation of justice in our country,\" Wilder told CNN's \"State of the Union.\"  But he said he believes the incident \"illustrates the need for more open discussion about race.\"  Reid's office made clear he has no plans to step down.  Democrats rejected the calls for Reid's dismissal, and Reid's office made clear he has no plans to step down.  \"Sen. Reid will stay in his position as majority leader and will run for re-election,\" his spokesman said.  \"As the leader in the fight to pass the Voting Rights Act and legislation banning hate crimes, Sen. Reid has a long record of addressing issues that are important to the African-American community. His Republican critics who are looking to politicize the issue can't say the same.\"  Reid's controversial quote is in the book \"Game Change,\" due in stores Monday. The authors write that \"Reid was convinced, in fact, that Obama's race would help him more than hurt him in a bid for the Democratic nomination.\"  In a statement to CNN, Reid said, \"I deeply regret using such a poor choice of words.\"  \"I sincerely apologize for offending any and all Americans, especially African-Americans for my improper comments. I was a proud and enthusiastic supporter of Barack Obama during the campaign and have worked as hard as I can to advance President Obama's legislative agenda,\" Reid said.  In his defense, he pointed to his efforts to integrate the Las Vegas strip and the gaming industry, among other legislation favored by African-American voters.  \"I have worked hard to advance issues important to the African-American community,\" he said.  And the senate leader called Obama on Saturday afternoon to apologize for the remarks. In a statement issued after the call, Obama said, \"As far as I am concerned, the book is closed.\"  \"Harry Reid called me today and apologized for an unfortunate comment reported today,\" the president said. \"I accepted Harry's apology without question because I've known him for years, I've seen the passionate leadership he's shown on issues of social justice and I know what's in his heart.\"  An aide to the senator told CNN that Reid also offered apologies to several prominent African-American political figures, including House Democrats Jim Clyburn of South Carolina and Barbara Lee of California; the Rev. Al Sharpton; CNN political contributor and Democratic strategist Donna Brazile; NAACP chairman Julian Bond; and the head of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, Wade Henderson.  Steele, the GOP's first African-American chairman, was asked about the remarks on both \"Meet the Press\" and \"Fox News Sunday.\" He told NBC on Sunday he believes Reid is out of touch with \"how African-Americans generally feel\" about sensitive issues.  Steele was asked by NBC whether he believes the situation is similar to one involving former Sen. Trent Lott, who lost his post as Senate majority leader in 2002 after saying that the nation would have been better off if one-time segregationist candidate Strom Thurmond had been elected president.  \"Oh, yeah. There is a big double standard here,\" Steele said on NBC.  Steele added: \"When Democrats get caught saying racist things, you know, an apology is enough.\"  Steele said that if a Republican senator had made the same remark Reid did, Steele himself and the Democratic Party \"would be screaming for his head very much as they were with Trent Lott.\"  Cornyn, in his statement, also accused Democrats of following a \"double standard,\" and noted that they had pushed Lott to step down.  \"As we await his explanation, Sen. Reid should do the right thing, follow the example that he himself set in 2002, and step down as majority leader,\" Cornyn said.  Kaine shot back against those arguments.  \"Anybody looking at Trent Lott's statements praising somebody who had been a pro-segregation candidate for president will see that there is no comparison between those comments and those of Sen. Reid,\" Kaine told NBC.  The comments \"were in the context of praising the senator and acknowledging that the senator could be a great president, but they were still insensitive,\" Kaine said.  Asked whether Reid should resign, he said, \"Absolutely not.... We're moving on.\"  Nevada state Senate Majority Leader Steven Horsford, who is African-American, affirmed his support for Reid in a statement Saturday.  \"While I am disappointed in Sen. Reid's comment and choice of words, I accept his apology,\" said Horsford, a Democrat. \"I have known Sen. Reid for many years and he has consistently been supportive of advancing the interests of the African-American community as he has for all Nevadans and all Americans.\"  Steele, meanwhile, was asked about his remark in a Fox News interview last week that the GOP platform \"is one of the best political documents that's been written in the last 25 years, 'honest injun' on that.\"  \"Fox News Sunday\" host Chris Wallace noted that lawmakers from both parties have called that a racial slur.  \"Well, if it is, I apologize for it. It's not an intent to be a racial slur. I wasn't intending to say a racial slur at all,\" Steele said.

{"article": " -- An American missionary family living in Haiti has been providing virtually nonstop reports about the devastation from Tuesday's earthquake and tracking down information on others serving there.  \"There is no way to even begin to share the things we've heard and seen since 5 p.m. yesterday,\" Tara Livesay wrote on the family's blog Wednesday morning.  \"To do so would take hours that we don't have to give right now. Some of them feel wrong to tell. Like only God should know these personal horrible tragedies.\"  Tara and Troy Livesay are country directors for World Wide Village, a Minnesota-based charitable organization providing Christian education, health care, nutrition and micro-enterprise opportunities to children and families in Haiti.  \"Sometimes life in Haiti leaves you wondering 'Where are you God?' and other times we witness miracles with our own eyes,\" they write in their blog profile.  Besides Troy and Tara, the household in Port-au-Prince is made up of daughter Paige, 15, and \"the crew\": Isaac, 8, Hope, 7, Noah, 5, Phoebe Joy, 3, Lydia Beth, 2, Annie, also 2, and Peanut the dog. Some of the children are adopted. Daughter Britt, 19, lives in Texas with her husband, Chris.  In addition, there's Jeronne, the children's nanny. (\"She is the MVP around here. We love her and think of her as family,\" the blog says.)  Finally, there's Tipap, Troy's assistant, security chief and all-around handyman, who lives at the World Wide Village Guest House.  The Livesays see themselves and their efforts as \"a work in progress -- trying to make the love of Jesus known while learning to know Him better ourselves.\"  That work since Tuesday evening has been consumed by gathering and reporting information about the quake and accounting for missing missionaries and other people.  Troy Livesay's reports came in the form of tweets that alternated between raw descriptions and expressions of hope:  \"... covered in dust and debris... we saw a few bodies that had been pulled out of the rubble laying dead in the sidewalk... many others injured\"  \"Church groups are singing throughout the city all through the night in prayer. It is a beautiful sound in the middle of a horrible tragedy.\"  \"The worst damage is in Carrfour (South of Port, near the Palace) we are hearing that many two and three story buildings did not make it.\"  \"Tipap made it home from Carrefour - saw many dead bodies and injured along the way - said most buildings w/more than one story are down.\"  \"The Haitian people are out praying together -- aftershock happening right now.\"  Share your images and accounts  On the blog, Tara Livesay's writing is both pained and eloquent:  \"The few things we can confirm -- yes the four story Caribbean Market building is completely demolished,\" she posted. \"Yes it was open. Yes the National Palace collapsed. Yes Gov't buildings nearby the Palace collapsed. Yes St Josephs Boys home is completely collapsed. Yes countless countless - countless other houses, churches, hospitals, schools, and businesses have collapsed. There are buildings that suffered almost no damage. Right next door will be a pile of rubble.  \"Thousands of people are currently trapped. To guess at a number would be like guessing at raindrops in the ocean. Precious lives hang in the balance. When pulled from the rubble there is no place to take them for care Haiti has an almost non existent medical care system for her people.  \"I cannot imagine what the next few weeks and months will be like. I am afraid for everyone. Never in my life have I seen people stronger than Haitian people. But I am afraid for them. For us.  \"When the quake hit it took many seconds to even process what was happening. The house was rocking back and forth in a way that I cannot even begin to describe. It felt fake.

{"article": " -- The nomination of Elena Kagan to fill the seat of retiring Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens has caused quite a stir on the political left and right, as operatives on both sides try to ascertain exactly where she stands.  But it has also opened another fissure in the complex relationship that exists between black organizational leaders and President Obama, the nation's first African-American president.  Over the past year we have seen criticisms leveled by grass-roots activists, civil rights groups and the Congressional Black Caucus.  But instead of taking on the president, the beefs are largely aimed at \"those around the president.\" In previous administrations, these same individuals wouldn't have hesitated to call out Presidents George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George H.W. Bush or Ronald Reagan.  Why the hesitance? Because they also understand that a direct attack on President Obama could hurt them in two ways: They could find themselves cut off from the administration or they could anger their base by making the president's job more difficult when he is facing daily attacks from Republicans.  Even among African-American commentators, columnists and radio and TV show hosts, if you are too harsh on President Obama, the backlash has been swift and vicious.  The organizations know this, and trust me, the White House knows this, and has used it to its advantage.  That's why I call it the Obama-Black-Two-Step.  I've been told countless times by folks on both sides that Obama can't be seen as favoring African-Americans over others, and his White House has been especially scared of touching anything dealing with race.  As a result, black civil rights leaders and prominent Democrats have largely bitten their tongues, unwilling to publicly take on the president and some of his decisions. Instead, they quietly fume, mumbling under their breath and offering their critiques in measured tones.  Yet I have gotten the sense that black civil rights and political leaders may stop the racial solidarity and stand up on the principles they have long fought for. I've been expressly told that some have no interest in working hard or raising money in the fall on behalf of Democrats to hold on to the House and Senate.  The nomination of Kagan has become a flash point in this uneasy relationship, because this is the second time in a year that President Obama has made a Supreme Court appointment and his administration didn't seriously consider an African-American woman for the job.  The nomination of Sonia Sotomayor certainly was historic in that she became the first Hispanic to sit on the high court, and it was embraced by civil rights groups. Yet this time, for highly qualified African-American female judges, such as Leah Ward Sears, the retired chief justice of the Georgia Supreme Court, to never make the cut for a face-to-face interview with the president has ticked off a number of leaders I've talked with over the last several days.  What's the big deal about including a black woman? A Democratic pollster told me that black women have a higher voter turnout than any other ethnic-gender demographic -- 65 percent -- and it's vital for Obama to appeal to them. When Obama was behind Sen. Hillary Clinton in the polls, it was because black women hadn't embraced him yet. When they did, the race changed.  The uneasiness with Kagan's appointment among civil rights groups has focused on the hiring record of minorities during her tenure at Harvard Law School, which was followed by the White House pushing back to insulate her from criticism by saying the Harvard faculty makes the recommendations about hiring for tenured positions.  They were quick to blast out blogs, columns and articles written by African-Americans at Harvard to make clear Kagan is a major advocate of diversity.  When a meeting with civil rights leaders and administration officials was held at the White House on Tuesday with senior adviser Valerie Jarrett, I was told \"more listening than talking\" was done by the administration.  Civil rights leaders made clear that they felt they were being taken for granted in the process, and were expected to rubber stamp the choice.  When Kagan's nomination was unveiled Monday, the only prominent African-Americans in attendance were Charles Ogletree, a Harvard professor who taught both Obamas, and Wade Henderson, president of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. That's a stark contrast to Sotomayor's unveiling, when a number of civil rights leaders were there to back her bid.  That's why if you look at the public statements released this week by the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, the National Urban League and others, they are more neutral on Kagan's appointment, saying they look forward to hearing more about her views on a variety of issues as the nomination plays out.  Folks, that's lukewarm at best.  I've heard the previous complaints that congressional and civil rights leaders have been ignored by White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel, with one saying he has never attended a meeting with them (\"Even Bush sent Andy Card to meet with us,\" one leader told me). And that extends to others surrounding the president in various parts of the White House.  \"These problems are valid and BIG, and we cannot let them off the hook,\" I was told by one frustrated organizational head.  Yet this time is different.  White House officials would quickly suggest that they are on excellent terms with the Rev. Al Sharpton, but this goes beyond him. The Rev. Jesse Jackson is clearly on the outs with this administration, as seen in his banishment from the West Wing. But this contentious relationship is with civil rights, religious, economic and social justice officials. And it's getting worse.  One civil rights leader opined that President Obama is \"losing his emotional connection with black leadership and black voters.\"  This has huge ramifications for the president and his agenda, because Democrats are facing a major battle to hold on to the House and Senate in November.  A Wall Street Journal/NBC poll released Thursday shows that voters are split over who should control Congress -- Democrats and the GOP both got 44 percent. But of those most interested in the midterm elections, Republicans garnered 56 percent to 36 percent for Democrats.  Yet according to a study released in April by the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a nonpartisan think tank that focuses on African-Americans, upwards of 80 percent of black voters say they are very likely to vote in November. The group surveyed 500 African-Americans in Missouri, Indiana, Arkansas and South Carolina.  What helped catapult President Obama into the White House was a high black turnout, especially in the South, and he garnered 95 percent of the black vote. A drop of 10 to 15 percent by black voters for Democrats in November would be catastrophic.  As the Kagan nomination goes forward, White House officials have told me they expect no problems from civil rights groups.  That may be the case. But the distance is growing between this president and what many figured are his natural allies. In a year when you have energized your enemies, the last thing you need is to push away your friends.

{"article": " -- Miriam Brown has always wanted to visit Cape Cod, but when she recently began to plan a trip and found out she would have to pay $200 or more a night for lodging, her dream vacation seemed out of reach.  Miriam Brown and her husband bartered their services for room and board on Cape Cod.  Brown, who lives in New Orleans, Louisiana, is an accountant. Her husband is a home renovations contractor.  Like many people dealing with a soft real estate market and high food and gas prices, they just don't have that kind of extra cash for a trip.  \"I have traveled a lot in prior years, but after [Hurricane] Katrina, there's just no money for traveling,\" Brown said.  So she still plans to go, but she won't spend any cash at all on lodging.  Brown has joined the growing ranks of Americans who are bartering -- trading goods and services without exchanging money -- as a way to cope with tough economic times.  Brown posted an ad in the barter section of the online community Craigslist last month, offering to trade her accounting skills and her husband's knack for home repairs in exchange for room and board on Cape Cod, Massachusetts.  She has lots of company.  There were some 142,000 listings in the barter section of Craigslist in July, or almost double the number posted during the same month last year, according to Craigslist spokeswoman Susan MacTavish Best.  \"When the economy turns unfriendly, Craigslist users become far more creative to get their everyday tasks done,\" Best said.  Swapping 'to get by'  Other Web sites that put Americans in touch with like-minded people who are willing to trade everything under the sun have also seen a boost in traffic. SwapThing, which lists almost 3.5 million \"things\" available for trade, reports its customers are bartering for different reasons than before.  \"I think a few years ago it was more for fun,\" said Jessica Hardwick, SwapThing founder and CEO.  \"But we've seen a real shift in the last year, and especially an increase in the last few months, where I think people are really doing it to get by.\"  Some of the most popular items to trade for late this summer were school uniforms, which some parents found they could not afford to buy for their children, Hardwick said.  Experts aren't surprised Americans are becoming more financially creative during an economic downturn.  \"Historically, when times get tough, you see a 50 percent-plus increase in bartering as a way for people to be able to buy things or get things and do it economically,\" said C. Britt Beemer, chairman of America's Research Group.  The company talks with thousands of consumers every week to gauge their spending habits and attitudes.  A couple of years ago, many Americans had $500 to spend at the end of the month, but that money has evaporated because of rising prices, Beemer said.  \"We've never had a time, at least in my lifetime, where you have food and fuel going up at the same time. So it isn't a question of buying things, it's a question of buying nothing,\" Beemer said.  Breast implants and a horse  Businesses have long recognized the benefits of bartering, and there are hundreds of barter networks set up across the country to fill their needs.  They use barter credits as currency, so a plumber in need of a filling doesn't need to search for a dentist's office with plumbing problems to make a deal. He can fix a leaky pipe for one member of a network and use the credits he earned for that job at any other.  Since all kinds of companies are members, the trades can be all over the map, said Michael Krane, president of Green Apple Barter Services in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. His company has brokered everything from breast implants to college tuition to a horse.  \"Really, there are no limits to it. We trade for just about anything you can think of,\" Krane said.  Bartering on this scale is also robust in tough economic times. Krane said his exchange has seen a 20 percent rise in barter transaction volume in the first six months of this year.  A longtime client is Thomas Forrest, an orthodontist in suburban Pittsburgh who barters his services for everything from office improvements to stationery. His practice hasn't been affected by the economic downturn, Forrest said, but some of his patients seem glad to be able to visit him under the barter arrangement.  \"I think if you have a business owner who has children in need of braces, I sense a gratitude that that's available,\" Forrest said.  Barter exchanges must carefully document all trades, since the Internal Revenue Service considers income from bartering as taxable. However, a barter exchange \"does not include arrangements that provide solely for the informal exchange of similar services on a noncommercial basis,\" according to the IRS.  In New Orleans, Brown and her husband are getting ready to go to Cape Cod after finding a taker for her bartering offer on Craigslist. The couple will work five hours a day in exchange for staying in \"a beautiful three-bedroom house right in the center of it all,\" Brown said.  \"We can do a lot more if we don't have to pay for room and board,\" she added.", "Q": ["Q: What are Americans doing as a way to cope with tough economic times?

{"article": "  -- She's been called Italy's answer to Michael Moore, and she doesn't pull any punches -- even when the subject she's taking to task is Italian leader Silvio Berlusconi.  Filmmaker Sabina Guzzanti puts the prime minister's handling of the L'Aquila earthquake, which killed nearly 300 people and devastated the city when it struck last year, under deep scrutiny in her latest documentary \"Draquila -- Italy Trembles.\"  Recently screened at Cannes Film Festival, the documentary is creating a stir among critics and the Italian government alike.  Even though he has been dogged by allegations of corruption and fraud --  which he strongly denies -- as well as criticism of his personal lifestyle, many Italians still support Berlusconi.  There are so many scandals in Italy, the picture can get quite complicated, Guzzanti told CNN. At home, she is a well-known political satirist and critic of the government.  She decided to focus on one disaster, L'Aquila, to show how abuse of power, corruption and misinformation have contributed to what she presents as the precarious state of democracy in Italy today.  \"The idea was this: Explain Italy through L'Aquila,\" she told CNN.  The Italian government has responded angrily to the film, whose title is a combination of the words \"Dracula\" and \"L'Aquila.\"  Culture Minister Sandro Bondi refused to attend Cannes, where the film was shown as part of the festival's special screening program.  Bondi issued a statement, dismissing the documentary as \"propaganda\" and saying it \"offends the truth and all of the Italian people.\"  Guzzanti is used to incurring the government's displeasure.  \"Raiot,\" a political satire TV show she wrote, directed and acted in, was cancelled after just one episode on a state-owned television network following a defamation suit filed by Silvio Berlusconi's Mediaset TV network.  In a retort, she made \"Viva Zapatero,\" a 2005 film that examines censorship.  So, what is it about \"Draquila,\" Guzzanti's fourth feature, that has created an uproar among Berlusconi supporters?  Guzzanti argues that Berlusconi, whose ratings were suffering when the earthquake hit in April last year, took advantage of the tragic event to improve his image and boost the public's opinion of him.  The documentary uses straightforward language to paint a stark picture of what the filmmaker sees as Berlusconi's exploitation of the tragic event.  \"Opinion polls showed his popularity was plummeting. So, when, at 0332 on April 6, 2009, an earthquake awoke even those in the Big Brother house, and when it emerged an entire town was destroyed, for Berlusconi it was like God reaching out to him again,\" a voiceover says in the film.  Watch a clip of the film  In the wake of the quake, Berlusconi made a last-minute decision to move the G8 Summit to L'Aquila from Sardinia -- a gesture that attracted world attention -- and took advantage of photo opportunities in several trips to the leveled city.  Even more damning, though, is the documentary's examination of the reconstruction efforts in L'Aquila. In particular, the film takes issue with the role played by the Civil Protection Authority.  The film argues that the government agency has amassed such immense power under Berlusconi that it can dodge the law -- when granting reconstruction contracts, for instance -- all in the name of emergency and safety.  For Guzzanti, investigating the aftermath of the earthquake and the power of the Civil Protection Authority is a way of examining Italy's drift into authoritarianism.  \"They became like a private army of the prime minister with licence of spending money and making laws,\" she said of the agency. \"And I was shocked and started to investigate.\"  Her film has won praise, not only for its high degree of scrutiny, but for its even-handedness as well.  The Hollywood Reporter described \"Draquila\" as a \"straightforward and surprisingly balanced documentary.\"  While her probing style and knack for ruffling feathers make it easy to draw comparisons with Michael Moore, Guzzanti distinguishes herself with an ability to control her outrage.  As Variety pointed out in its review: \"While she's omnipresent, this is not the Sabina Guzzanti show; the helmer knows she doesn't need to constantly register her outrage for it to come across.\"  Grace Wong and CNN's Neil Curry contributed to this report.", "Q": ["Q: Who made the documentary?

{"article": "  -- Three aid workers have been shot over the last day in Somalia, two of them fatally, Somali media reports said.  Somalis prepare Monday to bury murdered Osman Ali Ahmed, the head of the U.N. Development Program.  The first fatality was a Somali, Mohamed Mohamud Qeyre. He was the deputy director of the group Daryeel Bulasho Guud (DBG), funded by a German company and affiliated with the group Bread for the World.  Qeyre was shot in the Somali capital of Mogadishu Friday night in what appeared to be a targeted attack, the reports said. He was shot by three gunmen outside the facility where aid distribution is coordinated. The gunmen may have been staking out the facility waiting for Qeyre to exit.  The head of DBG, in Nairobi, Kenya, said he will suspend all aid operations in Somalia for the time being.  The second fatality was a member of the Sodra nongovernmental organization, which is helping with humanitarian efforts in Somalia. Officials said it appears that Ali Baashi was also specifically targeted by gunmen.  Earlier this week, the World Food Program said a truck driver carrying its relief supplies was killed -- the fourth WFP driver killed in Somalia this year. Ahmed Saalim was shot when fighting broke out between convoy escorts and militiamen at a checkpoint, the U.N. aid agency said.  A growing percentage of the Somali population has become dependent on humanitarian aid. A severe famine swept the nation in 1991-1993, devastating crops, killing up to 280,000 people and displacing up to 2 million, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.

{"article": "JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (CNN) -- Reggae legend Lucky Dube, one of South Africa's most famous musicians, was killed in an attempted car-jacking as he dropped his children off at a relative's house, his record label said Friday.  Reggae star Lucky Dube was much loved by his fellow South Africans.  Dube, 43, was killed in Johannesburg around 8 p.m. local time Thursday after someone tried to steal his car, Gallo Record Company said in a statement. Police said he was shot. The statement said Dube attempted to escape but died almost instantly from his wounds.  Dube was much loved by his fellow South Africans, and his death cast a shadow over festivities ahead of South Africa's highly-anticipated appearance in the rugby World Cup final with England this weekend.  News of his death was the headline in many Friday newspapers, knocking the World Cup off the front pages for the first time in days.  Callers to talk radio stations suggested the Springboks wear black armbands in remembrance of Dube when they take to the field Saturday in Paris.  Gallo Records called the death \"senseless and random,\" and it was not clear whether Dube's attackers knew who he was.  South Africa is one of the most dangerous societies in the world. Figures from the South African Police Service show that from April 2006 to March 2007, more than 19,000 South Africans were murdered, more than 52,600 people were raped, and nearly 13,600 people were carjacked.  \"It's very sad,\" said Mark Sutherland, London bureau chief for Billboard Magazine. \"He's a big loss to the South African music business. (He was) one of their most successful artists and certainly one of their leading reggae artists.\"  Sutherland said Dube was an extremely respected musician who toured extensively around the world. Dube had just returned from a tour of the United States that stretched from California to New York.  His record company said Dube leaves \"a great void\" in the music industry after a 25-year career. Dube recorded 22 albums in Zulu, English and Afrikaans.  Born outside Johannesburg in 1964, Dube was named \"Lucky\" by his mother because he was the first child to be born after several failed pregnancies.  Dube started singing in 1982, joining a band playing Mbaqanga, or traditional Zulu music. It was only later that he began recording reggae tracks as a solo singer, but the genre was to dominate and define the remainder of his career.  Ivor Haarburger, the chief exectutive of Gallo Music Group, said he was deeply saddened by the loss.  \"Lucky was not just an extraordinary artist, he was a personal friend,\" Haarburger said. \"It's so sad to lose such a great friend and so tragically.\"  Dube is survived by his wife, Zanele, and his seven children: Bongi, Nonkululeko, Thokozani, Laura, Siyanda, Philani and three-month old Melokuhle.

{"article": "Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- In the middle of the street lies a young man who appears to be dead, a pool of blood beneath his head. A large concrete block is next to his shoulder, with shattered pieces of it around him. Blood trickles down the road.  Witnesses say he was a thief trying to steal people's money Friday amid the chaos from last week's earthquake.  \"This is robbery. He went to rob the people. He went to steal money -- American dollars,\" said a man at the scene who identified himself as Frederic Mano, a Haitian sportswriter.  \"The people kill him with the blocks, because the people are angry. They are not hungry, they are angry,\" Mano told CNN's Lisa Desjardins.  Gruesome photos from the scene show the man facing up, with his arms out to the side. He is wearing socks but no shoes.  A second concrete block is a few feet away from him.  Mano said the young man was one of several thousand prisoners who escaped after the earthquake struck.  He did not deserve to be killed, Mano says, \"but anyway, he's dead. That is destiny.\"  Other witnesses gave a similar account. They said they believed the man was a thief and might have been a prisoner who escaped.  In Haiti at this time, there is no immediate way to confirm the man's identity.  CNN learned of the situation when a Haitian approached a CNN crew. \"Do you want to see an example of citizen justice?\" the man asked.  He said a man had been stoned to death by an angry mob.  By the time CNN arrived on the scene, the crowd had mostly dispersed. Some people stood on the side, looking at the young man in the middle of John Brown Avenue, which is usually one of the busiest streets in the capital city.  There are no operating shops on the street. But there are many vendors selling items from tables or carts.  The incident took place near the Champs de Mars, the capital's central plaza that has turned into something of a tent city. It was just a few minutes' walk from CNN's bureau.

{"article": "New York (CNN) -- A new report saying that Iran could be secretly working on a nuclear weapon is a major development, but not one that should lead the U.S. to consider a military strike against the Tehran regime, according to analyst Fareed Zakaria.  The draft report, obtained by CNN and not yet approved by the International Atomic Energy Agency's board of governors, is the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency's strongest warning yet that Iran could be aiming to build a nuclear bomb.  Zakaria told CNN the report should spur U.S. diplomacy to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons but that talk by commentators outside the U.S. government of a potential military strike against Iran was wrongheaded. \"To be casually talking about military action because we're getting frustrated seems to me somewhat dangerous,\" he said.  Iran's Green Movement of protesters against the regime indicates that waiting could have its benefits, Zakaria said. \"At the end of the day, time is not on the side of this regime. It's a dysfunctional regime that has run the economy into the ground, taken a great and open and proud nation and turned it into a kind of paranoid and closed one and which is clearly losing the support of young Iranians by the day.\"  Zakaria, author and host of CNN's \"Fareed Zakaria GPS,\" spoke to CNN on Thursday.  CNN: The International Atomic Energy Agency has done a report saying that Iran could be at work on building a nuclear weapon. What do you think that means?  Fareed Zakaria: That's a major development because so far we have not really been able to assess whether Iran has decided definitively that it wants nuclear weapons. We know that it wants a nuclear capacity -- that is clear -- and it wants a large nuclear capacity and one that is robust so that they have multiple production sites.  But it has always seemed as though there were two views within the Iranian leadership. One was that Iran should develop a robust civilian nuclear capability and a robust missile program but that it should not put the two together because that would place it in clear violation of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. There are clearly others in Iran who believe that Iran should simply have nuclear weapons....  This would suggest that the harder line faction within Iran is winning out. We don't know for sure because this is all guesswork frankly....  CNN: What's happening with the negotiations?  Zakaria: The Iranians have been playing a very peculiar negotiating game where they sometimes seem interested in negotiating but rarely do they actually engage in good faith.... They rarely seem to engage in these with a consistent pattern with consistent positions -- which either means the leadership is very divided or they're playing games.  CNN: What's your view about the wisdom of imposing new sanctions?  Zakaria: It probably is the only course available right now since the prospect of engaging with Iran and giving it positive inducements does not seem to be going anywhere. I also think the sanctions that are being talked about are fairly narrow and targeted at particularly the Republican Guard within the regime, which seems to be most powerful faction. And that's the right approach to take. We know that generalized sanctions only hurt the average Iranian, and that is entirely counterproductive.  CNN: What's the impact of the domestic turbulence inside Iran, including the protest movement?  Zakaria: Nobody knows for sure, but it does seem to have confused the situation internally. [Iranian President Mahmoud] Ahmadinejad had made some conciliatory statements on the nuclear issue, which were then attacked by the opposition, and he retracted it, which suggests that he's feeling the pressure. It suggests that there are divisions within the regime, there's some sense of vulnerability.... It just makes it more difficult to negotiate with them, but it also suggests it may not be the worst thing in the world to wait and watch how this plays out in Iran.  CNN: What do you think about the military option?  Zakaria: The problems with the military option remain what they've always been, and it's a little alarming to see the way in which people are gravitating toward a military option, out of a sort of frustration that there isn't some magical solution here.  The military option is certainly not a magical solution. It's a very risky strategy with many potentially large, unintended consequences. A military strike would be a pre-emptive invasion of another country by the United States. It would not have any sanction in international law.  It would not be supported by the vast majority of the world, and it would only delay rather than destroy the Iranian program.  I've talked to many military experts, and we do not seem to have the ability to completely destroy a program like this, partly because nuclear technology is after all not some cutting-edge technology. This is 60-year old technology, and there are lots of people in Iran who are trained scientists.  It would also strengthen the hard-line elements within the regime, would weaken the Green Movement because they would have to come out in support of the regime, and against what would be a foreign attack on Iranian soil.  It would inflame the Middle East and make tensions rise everywhere, including the two places where the U.S. has a huge stake and tens of thousands of troops -- Afghanistan and Iraq -- and it would put the moderate Arabs on the defense. It would have the effect of radicalizing the region.  And those are pretty much the known consequences.... Then, there's always in the business of war, the unknown consequences. What would Iran's reaction be?... What kind of militia operations could it fund in Iraq and Afghanistan that would directly kill Americans?  CNN: Do you think the administration is seriously contemplating military action?  Zakaria: I don't think the administration is seriously contemplating it, but I'm struck by the degree to which many outside commentators are doing it, and the danger is... that the administration places itself in a box where it says things which leave it no option but to keep taking a harder and harder line. I don't think it's likely, but I do worry that there is a train which is leaving the station, which might end up in a military strike.  CNN: Do you think Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has been sounding the right note?  Zakaria: Absolutely. Secretary Clinton has been sounding the right note and being tough, making the point that they're willing to engage with the Iranians if they are serious.  I also think this most recent declaration by IAEA will make it easier for us to continue building a containment strategy against Iran, getting moderate Arab countries to ally with the United States, tacitly with Israel and against Iran politically and militarily within the region, get the Europeans even more strongly on board and most crucially get the Russians and the Chinese on board for sanctions in the U.N. -- further, tighter and tougher sanctions.  CNN: Aside from sanctions and watchful waiting, is there anything else that should be done?  Zakaria: I think we should be supporting the Green Movement in Iran. I don't think we need to do it in a dramatic and overt kind of way, which would probably be counterproductive. But there are ways in word and deed that the United States could make clear that we support the aspirations of those Iranians who want a more normal Iran, a more open democratic Iran, more engaged with the world. That is not inconsistent with us saying we want to negotiate with Iran. We did that with the Soviet Union.  If there was a way for us to construct a containment strategy that at the same time left room for negotiations on the one hand and also left room for us to express our hopes and support for a different Iran in the future, that would be the best long-term strategy for us....  It's difficult to predict when and where things will change, but it's difficult to imagine that 25 years from now Iran will still be run by this unholy alliance of a bunch of reactionary mullahs and power-hungry military leaders.", "Q": ["Q: What does the draft report say about Iran?

{"article": " -- Ed McMahon, the longtime pitchman and Johnny Carson sidekick whose \"Heeeeeeerre's Johnny!\" became a part of the vernacular, has died.  Ed McMahon had suffered several health problems in recent years.  McMahon passed away peacefully shortly after midnight at the Ronald Reagan/UCLA Medical Center, his publicist, Howard Bragman, said Tuesday  McMahon, 86, was hospitalized in February with pneumonia and other medical problems.  He had suffered a number of health problems in recent years, including a neck injury caused by a 2007 fall. In 2002, he sued various insurance companies and contractors over mold in his house and later collected a $7 million settlement.  Though he later hosted a variety of shows -- including \"Star Search\" and \"TV's Bloopers and Practical Jokes,\" McMahon's biggest fame came alongside Carson on \"The Tonight Show,\" which Carson hosted from 1962 to 1992. The two met not long after Carson began hosting the game show \"Who Do You Trust?\" in 1957. iReport.com: Share your memories of Ed McMahon  \"Johnny didn't look as if he was dying to see me,\" McMahon, who was hosting a show on a Philadelphia TV station, told People magazine in 1980 about the pair's first meeting. \"He was standing with his back to the door, staring at a couple of workmen putting letters on a theater marquee. I walked over and stood beside him. Finally the two guys finished, and Johnny asked, 'What have you been doing?' I told him. He said, 'Good to meet you, Ed,' shook my hand, and I was out of the office. The whole meeting was about as exciting as watching a traffic light change.\"  Watch McMahon discuss meeting Johnny Carson \u00bb  Though McMahon was surprised to be offered the job as Carson's sidekick, the two soon proved to have a strong chemistry. Carson was, by nature, introverted and dry-witted; McMahon was the boisterous and outgoing second banana, content to give Carson straight lines or laugh uproariously at his jokes (a characteristic much-parodied by comedians).  Watch Comedian Joan Rivers recall McMahon \u00bb  Carson made cracks about McMahon's weight, his drinking and the men's trouble with divorce. McMahon was married three times; Carson, who died in 2005, had four wives.  McMahon was also the show's designated pitchman, a talent he honed to perfection during \"Tonight's\" 30-year run with Carson, even if sometimes the in-show commercial spots fell flat.  For one of the show's regular sponsors, Alpo dog food, McMahon usually extolled the virtues of the product while a dog eagerly gobbled down a bowl. But one day the show's regular dog wasn't available, and the substitute pooch wasn't very hungry.  McMahon recalled the incident in his 1998 memoir, \"For Laughing Out Loud.\"  \"Then I saw Johnny come into my little commercial area. He got down on his hands and knees and came over to me.... I started to pet Johnny. Nice boss, I was thinking as I pet him on the head, nice boss. By this point the audience was hysterical.... I just kept going. I was going to get my commercial done.  \" 'The next time you're looking at the canned dog food...' -- he rubbed his cheek against my leg -- ... reach for the can that contains real beef.' Johnny got up on his knees and started begging for more. I started petting him again... and then he licked my hand.\"  McMahon also promoted Budweiser, American Family Insurance and -- during the most recent Super Bowl -- Cash4Gold.com. Entertainment Weekly named him No. 1 on its list of TV's greatest sidekicks.  Edward Leo Peter McMahon Jr. was born in Detroit, Michigan, on March 6, 1923. His father was a promoter, and McMahon remembered moving a lot during his childhood.  \"I changed towns more often than a pickpocket,\" McMahon told People.  He later joined the Marines and served in World War II and Korea.  Though McMahon was well-rewarded by NBC -- the 1980 People article listed his salary between $600,000 and $1 million -- his divorces and some poor investments took their toll. In June 2008, The Wall Street Journal reported that McMahon was $644,000 in arrears on a $4.8 million loan for a home in Beverly Hills, California, and his lender had filed a notice of default.  McMahon and his wife, Pamela, told CNN's Larry King that McMahon had gotten caught in a spate of financial problems.  \"If you spend more money than you make, you know what happens. And it can happen. You know, a couple of divorces thrown in, a few things like that,\" said McMahon, who added that he hadn't worked much since the neck injury.  McMahon later struck a deal that allowed him to stay in the house.  He is survived by his wife, Pamela, and five children. A sixth child, McMahon's son Michael, died in 1995.", "Q": ["Q: Who hosted \"Star Search\"? A:", "Q: Who is Johny Carson? A:", "Q: Who hosted \"The Tonight Show\"?

{"article": "BERLIN, Germany (CNN) -- A German cruise liner said Tuesday it plans to fly its passengers over the Gulf of Aden, instead of sailing them through, out of fear of pirate attacks in the region.  U.S. Navy image of pirates operating off coast of Somalia in October this year.  Hapag-Lloyd Cruises said all 246 passengers and most of the crew aboard the MS Columbus, currently at the start of an around-the-world cruise, will disembark at an undisclosed port, then fly to Dubai to continue their journey.  The company called the move a precautionary measure.  Pirate attacks in the waters off Somalia have shot up this year, with pirates staging increasingly bolder attacks on ever-bigger targets. So far this year, pirates have attacked almost 100 vessels off Somalia's coast and successfully hijacked nearly 40, according to the International Maritime Bureau.  Freight and cargo ships, cruise liners, and private yachts have all come under attack. In many hijackings, pirates take the crew and passengers hostage while they demand a ransom.  The problem has forced companies like Hapag-Lloyd, that use the Gulf of Aden, to make new plans, including stepping up security or changing their routes.  One shipping company announced last month it would bypass the region altogether, sailing instead around the Cape of Good Hope and adding thousands of kilometers to its voyages.  Read more about how to solve the pirate problem here.  Hapag-Lloyd said a general travel warning for the area, issued by the German Foreign Ministry, played a part in the decision. But the company also said it had asked the German government for naval protection and the request was turned down.  Representatives of Hapag-Lloyd and the German Defense Ministry could not immediately be reached for further comment.  The passengers on board the Columbus began the first leg of their world cruise November 28 in Genoa, Italy and are due in Dubai on December 17, according to Hapag-Lloyd's Web site. Further stops include Singapore, Bali, Indonesia and Sydney, Australia.  Hapag-Lloyd said that after the passengers and most of the crew disembark, the Columbus will sail through the Gulf of Aden with a skeleton staff. The passengers will stay in a five-star hotel in Dubai for three days until the Columbus arrives to take them back onboard, the company said.  Both the crew and passengers approve of the safety measure, Hapag-Lloyd said.  The U.S. State Department and British Foreign Office advise those traveling near the Somali coast to use extreme caution because of the recent pirate attacks.  Last week, the Australian government issued a similar warning about travel to the region. The advice also urged Australian ships \"to apply a robust and layered protective security regime\" when traveling through the area.  -- CNN's Frederik Pleitgen contributed to this report.", "Q": ["Q: Who needs to use caution?

{"article": "CHICAGO, Illinois (CNN)  -- U.S. President-elect Barack Obama announced key members of his energy team on Monday, naming physicist Steven Chu as secretary of energy, and former EPA administrator Carol Browner to a new post in the White House to coordinate energy and climate policy.  Carol Browner was one of four key environmental nominees named by Obama.  Obama also named Lisa Jackson, former head of New Jersey's environmental agency, to serve as his Environmental Protection Agency administrator, and Nancy Sutley, the Los Angeles deputy mayor for energy and environment, to lead the White House Council on Environmental Quality.  Sutley, a prominent supporter of Sen. Hillary Clinton's bid for the Democratic presidential nomination, is the first high-ranking gay appointee to the Obama administration.  \"In the 21st century, we know that the future of our economy and national security is inextricably linked with one challenge: energy,\" Obama said at a news conference to introduce his energy team.  \"We've seen Washington launch policy after policy, yet our dependence on foreign oil has only grown, even as the world's resources are disappearing,\" he said.  \"This time has to be different. This time we cannot fail, nor can we be lulled into complacency simply because the price at the pump has for now gone down from $4 a gallon.\"  Obama called Chu \"uniquely suited to be our next secretary of energy\" for his work on new and cleaner forms of energy. Chu, who runs the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California, won the 1997 Nobel Prize in physics and is highly respected in energy circles.  Browner, who was administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency in the Clinton administration, was named to be the nation's first \"climate czar,\" working inside the White House on policy issues.  \"Carol understands that our efforts to create jobs, achieve energy security, and combat climate change demand integration among different agencies, cooperation between federal, state, and local governments and partnership with the private sector,\" Obama said.  He said that Jackson, as commissioner of New Jersey's Department of Environmental Protection, helped make that state a leader in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and developing new sources of energy.  \"Lisa also shares my commitment to restoring the EPA's robust role in protecting our air, our water, and abundant natural resources so that our environment is cleaner and our communities are safer,\" Obama said.  Sutley has been \"at the cutting edge\" of environmental work on the municipal and regional level, Obama said. She will be \"a key player in helping to make our government more efficient in coordinating our efforts to protect our environment at home and around the globe,\" he added.  Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa praised the appointment of his deputy mayor to a national post.  \"With Nancy on my team, we have made tremendous progress -- from quadrupling our renewable energy portfolio to exceeding the targets set out by the Kyoto Protocol four years ahead of schedule,\" he said in a written statement.  Energy is one aspect of the president-elect's goal to create 2.5 million jobs by 2011. The plan aims to put Americans to work updating the country's infrastructure, making public buildings more energy-efficient and implementing environmentally friendly technologies, including alternative energy sources.  During his campaign, Obama said he would invest $150 billion over 10 years in clean energy. He proposed increasing fuel economy standards and requiring that 10 percent of electricity in the United States comes from renewable sources by 2012.", "Q": ["Q: What was created for the policy coordinator?

{"article": "ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- In a bustling room full of computers, giant wall-mounted monitors and constantly ringing telephones, a newly gathered army is fighting a war.  The swine flu outbreak has kept workers busy at the Emergency Operations Center at the CDC..  The control room is staffed 24/7, and the leader recently had to tell his fighters to make sure to take a day off per week.  This is the Emergency Operations Center at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which has ramped up its resources to tackle swine flu, a new disease that experts say may evolve into a global pandemic.  \"The last time when we were really at this level was Hurricane Katrina,\" said Toby Crafton, operations manager.  The CDC has 400 people tasked to work on the virus, also called the 2009 H1N1 flu, Crafton said. The agency had deployed 50 people to various U.S. states and Mexico by Friday.  The Mexican government asked the CDC to help facilitate laboratory testing of the virus during a conference call with Canada and the United States, he said.  Watch as Dr. Sanjay Gupta tours the Emergency Operations Center \u00bb  \"We don't go anywhere unilaterally. We don't go into any state unless asked,\" Crafton said. \"So if the state health department or the state health director or the government feels like their capacity is exceeded or they need us for our scientific expertise, they will ask us to come.\"  Explainer: What you should know about 2009 H1N1 flu \u00bb  The U.S. has also committed to giving Mexico 400,000 doses of the antiviral drug Tamiflu, a shipment believed to have arrived Friday morning, said Dr. Anne Schuchat, interim deputy director for science and public health at the CDC.  In front of each computer in the Emergency Operations Center is a placard: Ethics, Immunization, Mental Health, Security, and dozens more. The people -- some in jeans, some in skirts, some in uniforms with military stripes -- are fielding phones calls to their respective departments.  Elsewhere in laboratories, samples of the virus arrive in FedEx and World Courier packages for analysis, triple packaged to avoid leaking. Scientists are working on the genetic sequencing of the virus, as well as growing a strain that functions as a vaccine.  Although the CDC is not in the business of mass-producing vaccines, researchers there are working on developing one. A vaccine strain is being grown and characterized, Schuchat said.  Once a suitable candidate virus is developed -- it takes about three weeks -- the CDC theoretically would send it to a manufacturer, which would need another eight to 10 weeks to determine production possibilities as well as the dosage, said Dr. Nancy Cox, director of the CDC's Influenza Division, at a press conference Friday.  But it would not interfere with the seasonal influenza vaccine.  \"If a vaccine for this new virus is prepared, it would be prepared either in parallel with or after the seasonal vaccine is already produced,\" Cox said.  Still, there has not been a recommendation to mass produce a vaccine for swine flu. The U.S. part of that decision would come from the Department of Health and Human Services.  Map: Where the flu is \u00bb  Researchers are still struggling to understand the origin of the virus.  \"What isn't making sense right now is why there weren't reports of illness in pigs,\" said Michael Shaw, leader of the laboratory team force for the 2009 H1N1 virus. \"Usually, if you find a human who has been infected by a swine influenza virus, you look around, you start seeing sick pigs, and we haven't seen that.\"  Watch Dr. Sanjay Gupta talk with Michael Shaw about what CDC is doing to combat virus \u00bb  It is possible that the virus did not originate in pigs. Swine viruses have been found in turkeys, for example, Shaw said.  The 2009 H1N1 virus has a \"level 2\" containment distinction at the CDC, although extra precautions from \"level 3\" are being applied, Shaw said. That means swine flu is one containment level below avian flu, which was at 3. One key handling difference is that lab workers had to shower after being exposed to the avian virus, he said.

{"article": "MADRID, Spain (CNN) -- One of Osama bin Laden's sons has been denied asylum in Spain, an Interior Ministry spokeswoman told CNN on Wednesday.  Omar bin Laden pictured earlier this year during a television interview in Rome, Italy.  Omar bin Laden, who is in his late 20s, stepped off a plane at Madrid's Barajas International Airport during a stopover late Monday and informed authorities that he planned to request political asylum, the spokeswoman said.  Bin Laden has publicly called on his father to abandon terrorism.  He prepared his formal asylum request Tuesday at the airport with the help of a translator, filing it around 1 p.m., the spokeswoman said.  The Interior Ministry, which had 72 hours to reply to the request, was required to seek the opinion of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees on the matter. The UNHCR recommended against granting asylum, the spokeswoman said Wednesday.  No reason was given for the denial.  It was not immediately known what grounds bin Laden gave for his request, and the spokeswoman said it is unlikely to be disclosed.  His flight Monday originated in Cairo, Egypt, and landed in Madrid on its way to Casablanca, Morocco, she said. The request caught Spanish authorities by surprise, she said.  Bin Laden, who is married to a British citizen, previously was denied asylum in Britain. He holds a Saudi passport.  Since Spain has denied his request, bin Laden has 24 hours to appeal before he is put on a plane back to Cairo, the spokeswoman said. If he appeals, the Spanish government has 48 hours to rule on it.  Last year, 7,664 people requested asylum in Spain. The government granted that status to only 570, the spokeswoman said.

{"article": " -- In the black market of prison life, cell phones have become perhaps the hottest commodity. Now, Texas is among a growing number of state governments going after them.  Hundreds of contraband cell phones were found behind bars or in transit to Texas inmates in 2008.  Tiny, easy to hide and an unmonitored link for convicts to the outside world, cell phones are valuable contraband, fetching a greater asking price from convicts than some shipments of illegal drugs.  John Moriarty, inspector general for the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, said that one phone can fetch as much as $2,000.  \"It takes one crooked prison worker to populate a whole prison unit with them,\" he said.  More than 1,200 wireless phones sit in law enforcement evidence rooms, all found behind bars or in transit to Texas inmates in 2008.  Moriarty is the investigator and bloodhound the state of Texas uses to trail the illegal traffic.  \"These are not stupid people,\" he said of the coordinated efforts to slip phones into the prison and hide them. \"There are a lot of hands in between and they all want a piece of the action.\"  Accomplices on the outside vary from family members, to friends to fellow criminals who buy or steal the phones and charge them with minutes.  The contraband is then moved through an elaborate series of drop points and usually ferried into the walls of a prison by a guard or trustee -- an escape engineered in reverse. Finding the dirty prison employee is often the key.  \"Some of these guys make next to nothing, so you can see how easy it could be to corrupt them,\" Moriarty said.  State Sen. John Whitmire, a Houston Democrat and the chair of the state senate's Criminal Justice Committee, became an ally of Moriarty's after one phone call in October.  He picked up a phone slip from his secretary and called the number on it -- only to realize he had returned a call to a death row inmate's cell phone.  The inmate, he said, was Richard Tabler -- a convicted double murderer who was sharing a wireless phone with nine other inmates.  \"At first I thought it was a hoax,\" said Whitmire, who said he called the state justice board and \"read them the riot act.\"  Whitmire is one of the sponsors of a bill in the Texas Legislature that would crack down on convicts caught with phones and allow prison systems to monitor and detect cell signals. It's en route to Gov. Rick Perry's desk after clearing both houses of the legislature this week.  Other efforts are under way at both the state and federal level.  In January, U.S. Rep. Kevin Brady, a Texas Republican, introduced legislation that would let prisons jam cell-phone signals within their walls.  Last month, Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley asked the federal government for permission to do so in his state.  Prison officials in Arizona are training dogs to sniff out cell phones.", "Q": ["Q: What are training dogs for?

{"article": "ELDORADO, Texas (CNN) -- Ambulances rolled into a Texas ranch that's home to members of a polygamist sect, as authorities continued their search Saturday night for possible victims of physical and sexual abuse.  Authorities are seeking Dale Barlow, 50, seen in a mugshot from a 2005 arrest on child sex charges.  The emergency vehicles were called for as investigators prepared to search the group's temple, law enforcement officials said.  The sect is a rogue branch of the Mormon church, which forbids nonbelievers from entering its temples.  Authorities wanted medical backup \"in case they're involved in sensitive areas that could escalate into a negative reaction,\" a law enforcement source said.  A police helicopter also had begun circling the ranch Saturday night.  Earlier, dozens more children and young women were removed from the compound.  A total of 183 people, including 137 children, have been taken away since law enforcement officers raided the compound Thursday night, said Marleigh Meisner, a spokeswoman for the Texas Child Protective Services Division.  The children -- most of them girls -- were being interviewed by special investigators, she said.  \"We're trying to find out if they're safe,\" she explained. \"We need to know if they have been abused or neglected.\"  Eighteen of the girls have been taken into state custody.  Authorities believe that they \"had been abused or were at immediate risk of future abuse,\" said Child Protective Services spokesman Darrell Azar.  The others were taken to a nearby civic center. Meisner described them as doing \"remarkably well.\"  Watch a report on the latest developments \u00bb  Authorities continue to search the 1,900-acre YFZ ranch, occupied by followers of imprisoned polygamist sect leader Warren Jeffs, and at least one man is being sought by police.  According to the search warrant, authorities are looking for Dale Barlow, 50, whom they suspect of having married and fathered a child with a 16-year-old girl.  Watch an Eldorado neighbor talk about the raid \u00bb  Law enforcement agencies raided the ranch Thursday night after receiving a report Monday that a 16-year-old girl had been \"sexually and physically abused,\" Azar said.  Watch buses take girls from compound \u00bb  The warrant cited an \"immediate need\" for authorities to have access to the 16-year-old and an 8-month-old child with either the last name of Barlow or the girl's last name. It instructs law enforcement officers to look for any records showing that Barlow and the girl were married and any evidence of them having a child.  Barlow is in Arizona and does not know his accuser, his probation officer told The Salt Lake Tribune.  \"He said the authorities had called him [in Colorado City, Arizona], and some girl had accused him of assaulting her, and he didn't even know who she was,\" Bill Loader said.  Barlow pleaded no contest last year to conspiracy to commit sexual conduct with a minor, The Associated Press reported.  He was ordered to register as a sex offender for three years, according to the AP.  His lawyer in that case told the AP he had not spoken to Barlow in a year.  Jeffs, the 52-year-old leader and \"prophet\" of the 10,000-member church, was convicted in Utah last year and sentenced to 10 years on two counts of being an accomplice to rape, charges related to a marriage he performed in 2001. He faces trial in Arizona on eight charges of sexual conduct with a minor, incest and conspiracy.  Jeffs' Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints bought the land near Eldorado four years ago and built the ranch, which they call the YFZ Ranch. The letters are said to refer to the words Yearning for Zion.  It is home to as many as 400 members who relocated from their Arizona and Utah compounds.  State and local law enforcement agencies set up roadblocks around the ranch Thursday evening, preventing journalists from seeing what was happening on the property, according to Randy Mankin, editor of the Eldorado Success weekly newspaper.  \"This came totally out of the blue,\" Mankin said.  There were no indications of violence around the ranch, he said.  When CNN crews have visited the ranch, it was guarded by armed men equipped with night vision gear and other high-tech surveillance tools to prevent intruders.  When CNN flew over the ranch in a small plane last year, the crew saw a massive temple, the three-story housing units where Jeffs' chosen followers live, the water tower, the school and community center, the dairy and cheese factory and a massive concrete mill.  The church openly practices polygamy in two towns straddling the Arizona-Utah state line -- Hildale, Utah, and Colorado City, Arizona -- but members living on their Texas ranch rarely venture into Eldorado, four miles to the south.  Critics of the sect say that it arranges marriages for girls as young as 13 and that competition for brides may be reduced through exiling young men. If male followers are excommunicated, the critics claim, their wives and children can be reassigned to someone else.

{"article": "ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Gregory Maguire absently cleans his glasses with his tie as he talks about pushing someone down the stairs.  \"I use children's stories as kind of a snare and temptation and illusion to draw in readers,\" Gregory Maguire says.  \"I wonder if you've ever stood at the top of the stairs behind someone who's really annoying and just imagined putting your foot out and planting your boot in somebody's objectionable behind?\" he asks. \"You know, I think that thought is a fairly common human thought.\"  Maybe for the author of \"Wicked,\" who looks more like a college English professor than someone who spends his days writing about the world of Oz. Maguire often imagines evil, and how those without self-control respond to it.  Maguire's \"Wicked\" series puts a spin on the classic \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\" tale, bringing in corruption, political prisoners and war. His first book, \"Wicked,\" has sold more than 2.5 million copies, and the musical based on the book reportedly has been seen by more than 3.75 million people in New York alone. National tours have been huge successes.  Maguire's newest book in the series, \"A Lion Among Men,\" tells the story of the Cowardly Lion -- the motherless cub defended by Elphaba in \"Wicked.\"  Watch Maguire roar about \"Lion\" \u00bb  CNN talked to Maguire about the book's main character, his life before \"Wicked\" and why he has never written realistic adult fiction. The following is an edited version of that interview:  CNN: To someone who's never read your books before, how would you describe your style?  Gregory Maguire: I would describe [my books] as being, not quite allegories, but commentaries on contemporary society -- and indeed politics to some extent -- enshrouded in, and disguised by, the guise of children's stories.  In other words, I use children's stories as kind of a snare and temptation and illusion to draw in readers who say this is going to be easy... and it's going to be fun. And indeed I hope it is fun. But once I get people involved in the plot, I hope to also communicate some of the questions I have about the way we live our lives in the 21st century.  CNN: Talk to me about Brrr. What's his personality like? What is he going through?  Maguire: Well, Brrr is the name that I've given to the cowardly lion who is the main character -- the protagonist -- in this novel called \"A Lion Among Men.\" And I gave him that name for two reasons: One, because it does sound like a shiver, and he is always slightly spooked by the world; and the second reason, because the two letters in it B-r-r-r are both letters from the name of Bert Lahr, who played the Cowardly Lion so famously in the 1939 MGM film.  His character arises in the hollow space in our perceptions between that giant roaring lion at the MGM logo... the ideal lion, and the kind of sad, sacked, out of work, vaudeville performer in lion pajamas that we see when Dorothy actually runs into the lion on the Yellow Brick Road.  In other words, there's a huge disconnect between the image we project of ourselves -- the best we might ever hope to possibly be -- and the way we feel about ourselves at our absolute worst -- when we're the most down in the dumps. There's a huge space in between there. So the novel's really in some ways about character and taking control of the destiny of your own character.  CNN: Everyone knows of your success with \"Wicked\" -- it's huge. But what was your life like before you wrote that book?  Maguire: I had written children's books for 14 years before I published \"Wicked.\" And none of them were poorly reviewed, and none of them sold enough for me to be able to buy a bed.  I was the traditional artist in the garret, expecting to live that way or maybe to give up writing soon because I would eventually have to get a job that was going to pay me some kind of retirement package. Silly thought, that, these days.  CNN: You often take the point of view of the \"wicked\" or \"evil\" characters in your books. How do you get inside their heads?  Maguire: Well, I like to think I'm a pretty good-natured guy and pretty civil and probably not ever truly guilty in any serious way of any legal infractions. But I do seem to have an unconscionable, easy time of thinking about how people might do wrong, of what they might feel like and how they might behave if they had less self-control than I do.  And then also, how they would have to deal with the weight of being called evil. If everyone was always calling you a bad name, how much of that would you internalize? How much of that would you say, all right, go ahead, I'll be everything that you call me because I have no capacity to change your minds anyway so why bother. By whose standards should I live?  In a way, all three of my adult books come down to that question -- by whose standards should I live? Can I find my own standards? Can I recognize them? Can I value them if I can name them? And are they good enough, are they strong enough, standards by which to live?  CNN: You talked about writing children's books. How is writing for children different than writing for adults?  Maguire: Well, for one thing children are intensely more impatient than adults. So you have to start out active, you have to start out strong and you cannot be, for a moment, self-indulgent.  Everything has to be a sound bite or something that the children can visualize as if they're running a little Super 8 projector in their mind. Now I date myself with ancient technology, but you know what I mean... write the scene that you want Steven Spielberg to film, which means every sentence has to give us something to see. Make it intensely visual and this is, I think, the main rule for writing for children.  But in no way do I make it less thoughtful. I just actually have to work harder. Writing for children is like the difference between writing a sonnet and writing a gossip column. I mean you have a lot more restrictions so you have to work a lot harder.  I'm not saying that a gossip column can't be intensely rewarding, but I dare say it's easier to write.  CNN: Have you ever considered writing anything that's not magical, or more real life?  Maguire: I have, but I never seem to get very far. In a way, and I don't mean to talk myself down, but sometimes I look at the mysteries of other people and I think, \"How do I know if they think anything like I think?\"  I can only guess who you might be. You might see the world in a whole different range of colors than I do. You might be super sensitive to nuances of body language or music or... I just don't know.  So I always feel when I try to write realistic fiction for adults, that maybe I don't have enough life experience, even though I'm 54. I'm not sure I trust it.  But when I write something that has a magic base to it, I put in everything I do know about the infinite varieties and subtleties and ambivalences in adult behavior, but nobody can call me out and say, \"You don't even know who human beings are\" because I've couched it.  I suppose it's a kind of safety net for myself, or a security blanket. If I'm writing magic, nobody can say I got it wrong because we all know magic doesn't exist.", "Q": ["Q: What is \"A Lion Among Men,\" about? A:", "Q: What did Maguire write for 14 years?

{"article": "BANGKOK, Thailand (CNN) -- An Australian author imprisoned last month for insulting the king and crown prince of Thailand was on his way home Saturday after receiving a pardon from the king.  Harry Nicolaides behind the bars of a Thai holding cell.  Harry Nicolaides, 41, was arrested last August over his 2005 book titled \"Verisimilitude.\"  The book includes a paragraph about the king and crown prince that authorities deemed a violation of a law that makes it illegal to defame, insult or threaten the crown. CNN has chosen not to repeat the language because it could result in CNN staff being prosecuted in Thailand.  Mark Dean, a lawyer for Nicolaides, said he was released Friday and taken to the Australian embassy in Bangkok, where he stayed until leaving for Australia at about midnight.  \"He is obviously very relieved and grateful that the pardon was granted,\" Dean said.  Nicolaides was sentenced to three years in prison after pleading guilty last month. He faced a term of up to six years before the plea.  Watch shackled Nicolaides at court \u00bb  His lawyers then requested the pardon. King Bhumibol Adulydej had pardoned foreigners in similar cases in the past.  Dean said Nicolaides was deported from Thailand, but that he did not know of any other stipulations related to the pardon.  In an interview with CNN International, Dean avoided repeating what Nicolaides wrote, but said the passage was presented as a rumor, not a fact.  \"This is probably not the best time to repeat the passage that was found to be offensive,\" Dean said. \"But it concerned the crown prince of Thailand and a rumor that was being circulated in Thailand about the crown prince.\"  Nicolaides had been living in Thailand since 2003, lecturing at two universities about tourism.  He was about to leave Thailand when he was arrested on August 31. It is not clear why the authorities waited three years after the publication of his book to bring charges against him.  Fifty copies of the book were published, and only seven were sold.  Thailand's king is highly revered in the Buddhist nation. But even he has said in the past that he can be criticized. Thailand's prime minister, Abhisit Vejjajiva, also has told CNN he is concerned about what he called misuse of the law.

{"article": "(Tribune Media Services) -- Frank Santa Maria buys two tickets to Italy on Expedia. But when an agent misspells his wife's name, he must embark on an odyssey to ensure she'll be allowed to use her tickets. Will he be successful?  Q: I recently bought tickets to Italy by calling Expedia. I spelled my wife's first name to the agent. That afternoon we left town for a trip. When we returned the tickets were at the front door and a confirmation e-mail was waiting. My wife's first name was spelled Crista instead of Christa.  I immediately called Expedia, and was told I should have contacted them the day the e-mail was sent to me and that there would be a $150 re-ticketing fee. After several more calls and being put on \"hold\" for more than half an hour, a supervisor told me that there was nothing they could do. They couldn't even change the name on the ticket.  I contacted the airline directly and they told me they would make a note on my wife's passenger record. My wife's tickets are still wrong and I'm afraid we may have a problem with our connecting airline or with customs. What can I do?  -- Frank Santa Maria, New Braunfels, Texas  A: Expedia should have spelled your wife's name correctly. When it was clear that the company had made an error, it should have done everything in its power to fix it instead of giving you the runaround and forcing you to deal directly with your airline.  Then again, it should have never come to this. First, why are you phoning an online travel agency to buy tickets? It may be more convenient, but online agencies are built to handle your purchases online. It's more efficient and reduces the chance of an error being introduced -- like misspelling a passenger's name.  Second, you should always check your verification e-mail immediately. Expedia could have made a change to your ticket if you had caught the mistake earlier. It's essential that you review your itinerary as soon as possible. Believe me, I know. I just made this mistake and had to spend an extra day at my destination because I put the wrong date in my reservation. (See? It can happen to anyone.)  I've dealt with too many wrong-name cases to count, and here are a few things I've learned. Passengers aren't turned away at the gate because of a typographical error on their tickets. Reservations systems have limitations that sometimes truncate last names or render non-English names in funny characters. Last names and first names are frequently flip-flopped. Ticket agents, gate agents and security screeners know that, and will let you through.  I haven't heard of anyone being denied boarding because of a one-character difference in a name. I'm reasonably sure your wife would have been allowed to travel using her ticket, even if this had happened after the May 15 implementation of the first phase of the Transportation Security Administration's \"Secure Flight\" initiative, which requires that you provide your full name as it appears on your government-issued identification.  Incidentally, the \"notation\" in her reservation would have almost certainly been visible to any connecting airline. And a customs agent wouldn't even pay attention to your ticket under normal circumstances. It's your customs form and passport that matter to them.  Next time you buy tickets by phone -- and I hope there's no next time -- do yourself a big favor: When you offer your name to the agent, ask to have it spelled back. That way, you'll catch any errors before the transaction goes through. Once you have a reservation, it becomes much more difficult (or even impossible) to make a change.  It shouldn't be that way. In an ideal world, you'd be able to change a name on a ticket. Airlines say they can't allow name changes for \"security reasons\" but I'm inclined to believe it has more to do with the fact that they would lose lots of money if passengers could give their tickets to friends and family. Or resell them.  I contacted Expedia on your behalf, and it issued a new ticket with your wife's name spelled correctly.

{"article": " -- Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger can expect an apology from Premier League referees chief Keith Hackett following his dismissal in the closing seconds of Saturday's 2-1 English Premier League defeat to Manchester United.  Arsene Wenger has to stand with Manchester United fans after being sent off at Old Trafford.  League Managers Association chief executive Richard Bevan has spoken to Hackett about the Old Trafford incident which saw Wenger sent to the stands by referee Mike Dean on the advice of fourth official Lee Probert.  And he has been told that Wenger will receive an apology from the Premier Game Match Officials Board which appoints officials to top-flight games in England.  The Gunners manager caught Probert's attention when he kicked an empty water bottle down the touchline following a disallowed goal for Arsenal.  There was then confusion as Wenger seemed unaware of where he was supposed to go -- moving first to the back of Arsenal dugout then starting to walk down the touchline as the whistle was blown.  On the decision to penalize Wenger, Bevan said: \"Although correct in 'law', it was completely out of context in the game and it was followed by the nonsense which followed over where Arsene Wenger should sit to watch the game.\"  He added: \"I've spoken to Keith Hackett and he fully recognizes the situation was an error and an apology will follow to Arsene Wenger.  \"Lee Probert totally failed to manage the situation and created a needless pressure point taking the focus away from the pitch in a big event with only a minute to go.\"  Meanwhile, Arsenal's north London rivals Tottenham have suffered a setback with a serious injury to Croatia playmaker Luka Modric.  The 23-year-old broke his leg in Saturday's 2-1 victory against Birmingham, which left the club second in the English Premier League after four wins from four.  \"X-rays have determined that Luka Modric sustained a fracture to his right fibula,\" said a statement on the official Spurs Web site.  Tottenham did not indicate how long the midfielder would be sidelined, but he is likely to miss the home game against champions Manchester United and the trip to Chelsea which follow the upcoming international break.

{"article": " -- Benazir Bhutto, who was assassinated Thursday in Rawalpindi, was the first female prime minister of Pakistan and of any Islamic nation. She led Pakistan from 1988 to 1990 and again from 1993 to 1996.  Benazir Bhutto died Thursday after a suicide bombing at a political rally in Rawalpindi, Pakistan.  Bhutto, 54, spent eight years in self-imposed exile in Great Britain and Dubai after President Farooq Leghari dismissed her second administration amid accusations of corruption, intimidation of the judiciary, a breakdown of law and order, and undermining the justice system.  She was found guilty of corruption and sentenced to five years in prison. The conviction was later overturned but she remained in exile until this year.  She returned to Pakistan in October after President Pervez Musharraf signed an amnesty lifting corruption charges.  Watch political history of Bhutto \u00bb  In a September 26 interview on CNN's \"The Situation Room,\" Bhutto said she expected threats against her life as she prepared to lead a push for the restoration of democracy in Pakistan.  \"After military dictatorship an anarchic situation developed, which the terrorists and Osama (bin Laden) have exploited,\" she told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. \"They don't want democracy, they don't want me back, and they don't believe in women governing nations, so they will try to plot against me.  \"But these are risks that must be taken. I'm prepared to take them,\" she said.  Bhutto narrowly escaped injury on October 18 when a suicide bombing near her convoy in Karachi killed 126 people.  \"Soon thereafter, I was asked by authorities not to travel in cars with tinted windows -- which protected me from identification by terrorists -- or travel with privately armed guards,\" she wrote for CNN.com in November.  \"I began to feel the net was being tightened around me when police security outside my home in Karachi was reduced, even as I was told that other assassination plots were in the offing.\"  \"I decided not to be holed up in my home, a virtual prisoner,\" she wrote. \"I went to my ancestral village of Larkana to pray at my father's grave. Everywhere, the people rallied around me in a frenzy of joy. I feel humbled by their love and trust.\"  Musharraf declared a state of emergency and placed Bhutto under house arrest twice in November as anti-government rallies grew in Rawalpindi. The arrest warrant was lifted November 16.  She filed a nomination paper for a parliamentary seat on November 25 and appeared headed for a power showdown with Musharraf before she was assassinated Thursday.  See a timeline of Bhutto's political career \u00bb  Bhutto was the daughter of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, former president and prime minister of Pakistan, who was hanged in 1979 for the murder of a political opponent two years after he was ousted as prime minister in a military coup. Benazir Bhutto was the de facto leader of her father's Pakistan People's Party.  Her brother, Murtaza, was killed along with six others in a 1996 shootout with police at his home. Another brother, Shahnawaz, died mysteriously in France in 1985.  \"I know the past is tragic, but I'm an optimist by nature,\" Bhutto told Blitzer in September. \"I put my faith in the people of Pakistan, I put my faith in God. I feel that what I am doing is for a good cause, for a right cause -- to save Pakistan from extremists and militants and to build regional security.  \"I know the danger is out there, but I'm prepared to take those risks.\"  Benazir Bhutto earned degrees from Radcliffe College and Oxford University and received an honorary degree from Harvard University in 1989.  She leaves her husband of 20 years, Asif Ali Zardari, two daughters and a son.  Bhutto's husband issued a statement Thursday from his home in Dubai saying, \"All I can say is we're devastated, it's a total shock.\"  President Bush, on his ranch in Crawford, Texas, said Bhutto \"refused to allow assassins to dictate the course of her country.\"  \"We stand with the people of Pakistan in their struggle against the forces of terror and extremism,\" Bush said. \"We urge them to honor Benazir Bhutto's memory by continuing with the democratic process for which she so bravely gave her life.\" E-mail to a friend.", "Q": ["Q: What year was Bhutto's father hanged?

{"article": "NEW ORLEANS, Louisiana (CNN) -- A grand jury has indicted four people in the shooting death of a woman during what police say was a Ku Klux Klan initiation rite in the Louisiana woods, St. Tammany Parish prosecutors said.  Raymond \"Chuck\" Foster is reputed to be the leader of the Klan Group. He was among the four indicted.  Raymond \"Chuck\" Foster, 44, was indicted on second-degree murder charges Wednesday in the November death of Cynthia Lynch, 43, of Tulsa, Oklahoma. If convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of life in prison, said Rick Wood, spokesman for the St. Tammany Parish district attorney's office.  \"That's what he was charged with,\" Wood told reporters on Wednesday. \"The grand jury agreed with that charge.\"  Two other men, including Foster's son, Shane Foster, were indicted on a count of obstruction of justice, and a woman, Danielle Jones, was indicted on one count of being an accessory after the fact.  Wood said Thursday Foster's case was assigned to one judge and the others' cases were assigned to another. Foster is scheduled to be arraigned March 3, he said, and the others are set for arraignment next week.  Eight people initially were arrested in the case. The remaining four were not indicted.  \"Haven't seen one like this,\" Wood said Wednesday. \"We've had a lot of high-profile cases, but not one like this.... As (district attorney) Walter Reed said, it will be to the max. They will be prosecuted to the max.\"  Authorities said Lynch was recruited over the Internet and took a bus to Slidell, Louisiana, where she was met by two Klan members. They then went to a campsite in the woods near Sun, Louisiana, about 60 miles north of New Orleans, where they met other members of the group, police said.  During the initiation rite, members of the Klan group, which calls itself the Sons of Dixie, shaved Lynch's head, according to Capt. George Bonnett of the St. Tammany Parish Sheriff's Department and Sheriff Jack Strain, who spoke to CNN in November.  After 24 hours of drills, including chanting and running with torches, she asked to be taken to town. An argument began, authorities said, and the group's leader, Raymond Foster, pushed Lynch to the ground and shot her without warning.  Lynch apparently wanted to leave because she was homesick, investigators found after talking to her family members.  After the shooting, \"Foster, we believe, removed a knife from his pocket and rolled over the victim and began a process of trying to remove the bullet from her body... because he was trying to destroy evidence where law enforcement would not be able to piece these things together,\" Strain said.  Police believe other members of the Sons of Dixie helped cover up the slaying on Foster's behalf, Strain said at the time, including burning some of Lynch's personal items.  \"We're up to the challenge,\" Wood told reporters after the indictments were handed up Wednesday. \"This office is ready to proceed and take care of business.\"  Authorities received the initial tip about the slaying from a convenience store clerk, after two group members went into the store and asked him if he knew how to get bloodstains out of their clothes. The clerk told them he did not, then called police after they left.  Officials tracked down those two members and arrested them, then arrested others at the campsite and Foster. All the members surrendered without incident, police said.  Investigators found Confederate battle flags, Ku Klux Klan banners, five Klan robes and an Imperial Wizard robe at the campsite, authorities said. Lynch's body was found under loose brush along a road several miles from the campsite.  Raymond Foster has a history of Ku Klux Klan activity dating back seven years, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, a Montgomery, Alabama-based organization that tracks hate groups.", "Q": ["Q: who have son ?

Chris and Sheri Coleman are shown with their two boys, Garret and Gavin.  \"We don't have a warrant for his arrest at this time, so we don't feel it would be prudent to give his name out until the state's attorney determines whether or not there's enough to charge him,\" said Maj.

{"article": "NEW YORK (CNN) -- The home life Diana Krall shares with husband (and fellow musical brain) Elvis Costello and their 2-year-old twin boys is a little nutty.  Diana Krall's new album, \"Quiet Nights,\" was inspired by a trip she made to Brazil.  \"It's zany in the most wonderful way,\" says the 44-year-old jazz singer-pianist. \"You have two little boys leaping off the furniture who think they're Buzz Lightyear while we're practicing and playing. It's just a happy house.\"  Krall's domestic bliss -- \"domestic\" being a new concept for the ever-touring artist -- is suggested in the warm, intimate vibe of her latest album \"Quiet Nights.\"  \"It's a very natural process for me, making a record. It ends up being a reflection of where I am at that time. My life is just tremendous right now. It couldn't be better,\" she says.  No kidding. \"Quiet Nights\" debuted at No. 3 on the Billboard 200 album charts last week, a career high for Krall.  A memorable trip to Brazil in 2007 inspired the Canadian chanteuse to take her 12th album in a bossa nova direction: The title track is the English version of the bossa nova classic \"Corcovado.\" She also covers \"The Girl from Ipanema\" -- though naturally in her whispery rendition she flips \"girl\" to \"boy\" -- and gives a fresh spin on Frank Sinatra's \"Where or When.\"  Watch Krall find bliss in Brazil \u00bb  \"There was something about turning 'Where or When' into a bossa nova that changes the feeling for me of the song,\" Krall said. \"It's much more emotional than if I sang it in a swing feeling. I've always experimented with that.\"  Krall brought arranger and conductor Claus Ogerman on board. He was a natural, having worked with Sinatra and Brazilian singer-songwriter Antonio Carlos Jobim who wrote both \"Ipanema\" and \"Corcovado.\" And Krall co-produced the album with frequent collaborator Tommy LiPuma.  \"One of the best parts of making a record is the dinner after where you all you go to the restaurant, you decompress, have some great wine and just tell stories and listen to Claus and Tommy and [engineer] Al Schmidt and all these people telling amazing stories,\" says Krall.  Diana Krall recently sat down with CNN to share some stories of her own about a teenaged letter to Oscar Peterson, idolizing Harry Connick Jr. and Mickey Mouse pancakes. The following is an edited version of the interview.  CNN: This is the first album you've made since becoming a mother. Does it feel different somehow?  Diana Krall: I think [this album reflects my present] state of mind. It's not about loss, it's not preparing for loss. I'm not peeling grapes. Life has changed a lot and it's not just about performing and touring. It's motherhood and having a home for the first time, because I've always been on the road. So it's an incredible thing to be making Mickey Mouse pancakes in the morning while you're doing your interviews.  CNN: You've been producing Barbara Streisand's new album. What has that been like?  Krall: Incredible. I just am so thrilled with her performance on this album. [She gives] one of the most incredible performances I think of her career on a song called \"You Must Believe in Spring\" with a great pianist from New York named Phil Charlap. It's just piano and voice and it's so incredibly stunning. She said to me, \"Maybe it needs some strings or something.\" I said \"Don't touch it! Just leave it! It's gorgeous!\"  It's been great working artist to artist and we had a lot of fun. We played cards. So when there were moments in the studio where there was something technical that had to be fixed, we'd deal the cards and we'd play gin rummy, which I'm lousy at. Thank goodness.  CNN: This is the first album you've produced for another artist. Way to choose somebody really small to start off with.  Krall: She chose me! I had a few phone calls and it was a little daunting, but it was a great experience and really, really intense, as you would expect it to be.  CNN: Some people were a little put out by your record \"The Girl in the Other Room\" because you strayed from jazz. How did you process that reaction?  Krall: Somebody's always put out with anything I do (laughs). \"Why'd you do 'The Look of Love?' \" \"Why don't you do 'The Look of Love' again?\" I don't know! I'm too busy trying to put the Lego back in the box, and making sure nobody's eating all the Play-Doh.  That record did very well and a lot of people say to me, \"That's my favorite record.\" And I wrote [it] with my husband, so I don't really look back. I look forward. And I've got a pretty loyal audience.  CNN: What would you say to your sons if they tell you they want to be musicians when they grow up?  Krall: They should do whatever makes them happy. This is what they know so if that's what they choose to do -- who knows. They could be like my mom and my dad and be a teacher-librarian and a chartered accountant. That's fine too.  A month ago I found this letter I wrote to Oscar Peterson when I was 16 years old and my mom had saved it for me and put it in a box in the attic. It was a five-page letter I wrote to Oscar Peterson saying, \"Dear Oscar, I'm 16 years old and I hear a professional musician's life is a very difficult one but I know this is the only life I want to have.\" And it was really enlightening for me to see the focus of a 16-year-old. It reminded me of how much I love the music and always wanted to do what I'm doing, so how lucky am I?  CNN: But it's not all luck.  Krall: I think it's a lot of luck. I think I started in a very good time. When I went to see that film \"When Harry Met Sally,\" and I heard Harry Connick playing the piano, I though there's somebody who's my age and he's playing the music that I love. And I felt like there was a kindred spirit and it inspired me to go, \"I want to do exactly what he's doing.\" And I still owe a lot of thanks to Harry. I've only met him like a couple of times, but he's still a favorite artist of mine.", "Q": ["Q: What instrument does she play? A:", "Q: Whose new album is she producing?

{"article": "BOGOTA, Colombia (CNN) -- A former Colombian congressman who was held hostage in the jungle for more than eight years has escaped -- with the help of a former captor.  Oscar Tulio Lizcano was kidnapped on August 4, 2000 near the Colombian town of Riosucio.  Oscar Tulio Lizcano, his hair disheveled, appeared too weak to stand for long when he met the news media Sunday, hours after stumbling onto a military patrol -- and freedom.  Lizcano suffered from hunger and disease in captivity and endured isolation in the company of leftist rebels who often would not let him talk, he and Colombian authorities said.  \"Maybe my incoherence is for a lack of speaking,\" Lizcano told reporters. \"I was unable to talk with the guerillas who guarded me.\"  Lizcano said he had little to read in the jungle except \"The Odyssey\" by Homer. He suffered from malaria and other illnesses and once ate nothing but hearts of palm for six or seven days, said Juan Manuel Santos, the Colombian defense minister.  \"This is big news for the whole family,\" said Lizcano's sister, Amparo Lizcano. \"We were waiting for the guerrillas to give our brother back alive before he died.\"  The former congressman fled about three days ago with the assistance of one of his captors, a member of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, a leftist rebel force that has been fighting the government for more than 40 years in a war that also has involved right-wing paramilitaries and drug traffickers.  Watch release of FARC hostage \u00bb  President Alvaro Uribe appeared on television Sunday with the ex-FARC rebel -- known by the alias \"Isaza\" -- and said the man will receive compensation and permission to resettle in France with his family. He said that's in keeping with a Colombian government policy that rewards rebels who desert and help hostages gain their freedom.  Police officers and soldiers pinpointed the location of the FARC unit holding Lizcano several months ago, Santos said.  They monitored the location for about five months and took steps to seal off possible escape routes, he said, as they planned a rescue operation using information gleaned help from a rebel who deserted October 2. Troops started that rescue operation Saturday -- only to discover that \"Isaza\" and Lizcano had decided on their own to escape.  The two men wandered through the jungle for three days and nights before encountering a Colombian army patrol Sunday, said Santos, the defense minister.  Lizcano was kidnapped on August 4, 2000 near the Colombian town of Riosucio. He and his former captor stumbled Sunday onto a patrol near the border of the states of Risaralda and Choco, in central Colombia, authorities said.  The FARC holds an estimated 750 hostages in Colombia. Its members have justified hostage taking as a legitimate military tactic.  The rebels have been battered this year by government raids that killed several top commanders, the death by apparent heart attack of their founder and a wave of desertions.  Government commandoes tricked the FARC in July and freed their most prized hostage, the former presidential candidate Ingrid Betancourt, in an elaborate ruse that also liberated three U.S. defense contractors and 11 other hostages.  On Sunday, Lizcano offered words of encouragement to those hundreds who remain trapped in the jungle, captives of the FARC.  \"Hold on. Hold on,\" he said. \"One day you will enjoy your freedom, too.\"  -- CNN's Karl Penhaul contributed to this report.", "Q": ["Q: How many hostages did the Farc hold?

{"article": " -- Kim Clijsters continued her successful return to tennis by demolishing American third seed Venus Williams in the final of the Sony Ericsson Open in Miami on Saturday.  The Belgian, a former world No. 1 but seeded 14th for this event following her two-year absence from the women's circuit, will move up to 10th in the rankings next week following her one-sided 6-2 6-1 triumph at Key Biscayne.  Williams had been hoping for a fourth title at the event, having won her last two tournaments, but was well below par as Clijsters added to her 2005 victory in Miami in just 58 minutes.  The 26-year-old claimed her third title since making her comeback last year after giving birth to baby daughter Jada, who was watching her mum from the stands again on Saturday.  The 2009 U.S. Open champion notched up her 37th triumph in WTA Tour events, 28 of those now on hardcourt surfaces.  She passed $17 million in career earnings after taking home the $700,000 first prize -- which is almost $100,000 more than the winner of Sunday's men's final between Andy Roddick and Tomas Berdych will receive.  Clijsters, who defeated fellow comeback queen Justine Henin in an epic semifinal on Friday, broke Williams to love to seal the title.  \"It took a lot of hard work to get back into shape and I have a few people to thank, including my fitness coach and husband,\" Clijsters said on-court after the match.  \"It feels really good to be back here, having won the title in 2005. It's always nice to come back to a place you have done well before, and to such a beautiful stadium.\"  Williams, cheered on by injured younger sister and current No. 1 Serena, made 29 unforced errors to Clijsters' 12 as she struggled to continue her recent good run of form.  \"Sometimes when you hit a few bad shots it's not as easy to reel it in, and things start to go a little bit quicker,\" said Williams, who will rise to fourth in the rankings.  \"Obviously against a player like Kim, if you make too many errors, the match can go quickly. I mean, I think she hit eight winners, so it wasn't that she played extremely solid -- it's not like I was blown off the court. Unfortunately I was my own worst enemy today.\"", "Q": ["Q: What did 26 year old return from doing?

{"article": " -- Jury selection was under way Thursday in the case of a man accused of sexually assaulting a toddler and capturing it on videotape years ago, a crime that triggered a nationwide manhunt and search for the girl when the tape surfaced in 2007.  Chester Arthur Stiles faces life imprisonment if convicted of videtaping a sexual assault on a child.  Chester Arthur Stiles, 38, faces 22 felony counts in connection with the videotape, including lewdness with a child, sexual assault with a minor and attempted sexual assault with a minor. If convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of life in prison.  Thursday is the third day of jury selection, said Michael Sommermeyer, spokesman for Clark County, Nevada, courts.  Some 200 potential jurors were called, according to CNN affiliate KVBC. As of Thursday morning, only seven jurors had passed on to the next stage of selection, Sommermeyer said.  Prosecutors hope to seat 15 jurors eventually, Sommermeyer told CNN, meaning they'll want a pool of about 35 to pick from in the final stage.  Picking a jury in the case is challenging, according to KVBC, not only because of the media attention the case has drawn, but because of the crimes Stiles is accused of. A questionnaire given to potential jurors has one question addressing the videotape: \"As a juror, despite the graphic nature of the videotape, can you promise to remain fair and impartial and objectively evaluate all evidence for returning a verdict?\"  \"One, you let them know what the case involves and they've heard it on the news, it's a little difficult to get over any preconceived notions that they had about the case,\" defense attorney Stacey Roundtree told KVBC.  \"However, we do have faith in this community that they want to do the right thing,\" she said. \"Most of the jury trials I've had, the jurors go out of their way to make the right decision. They go out of their way to follow the judge's rules, and we're confident we can have that happen in this case.\"  The tape was given to authorities in September 2007 by a man who said he had found it in the desert five months before. On it, police found images of the small girl being sexually assaulted.  After attempting unsuccessfully to find out the girl's identity, authorities turned to the media for help and released a picture of the girl, and the case drew nationwide attention. She was found in October 2007.  An attorney for the child's mother said she is 7 years old and safe and healthy. The rape occurred before her third birthday while she was in the care of a baby sitter her mother had hired, he said. The mother did not know the girl had been victimized.  After the girl was found, authorities asked CNN and other news organizations to stop showing her picture.  Stiles, a resident of Pahrump, Nevada, was arrested in a traffic stop in October 2007. Police said at the time they pulled Stiles' car over because it had no license plate and became suspicious when the driver displayed an expired California license with a photo that did not match his appearance.  \"He finally told us, 'Hey, I'm Chester Stiles,'\" said Henderson, Nevada, police Officer Mike Dye. \"'I'm the guy you're looking for.\" Stiles told police he was \"sick of running,\" Dye said.  The mother of the girl shown on the tape, meanwhile, went on \"The Dr. Phil Show\" after Stiles' arrest, saying that while she was \"relieved,\" it would have been \"better if they found him dead.\" She said her daughter remembers nothing about the alleged assault.  \"Nothing that I have seen in my career comes close to what this girl has gone through,\" Nye County, Nevada, Sheriff Tony DeMeo said during the manhunt for Stiles.  The man who turned the tape over to authorities, Darrin Tuck, faced criminal charges because of the delay in turning it over, during which authorities alleged he showed it to others.  A judge gave Tuck a one-year suspended sentence and three years' probation in April after he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to obstruct a public officer, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal. He initially had faced a felony count of possession of child pornography.", "Q": ["Q: Who faces 22 felony counts in connection with sex tape? A:", "Q: Who discovered the tape?

{"article": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- Saudi Prince and billionaire Al-Waleed bin Talal says he will build the world's tallest building,  planned to be over a kilometer (3,281 feet) high. The tower will be built in the Saudi town of Jeddah and will be part of a larger project that will cost $26.7 billion, (100 billion Saudi riyals) said the Prince's firm, Kingdom Holding Company.  The planned Kingdom City project will be taller than Burj Dubai tower which is the world's tallest man-made structure.  The project, entitled Kingdom City, will span 23 million square meters (248 million square feet) and will include luxury homes, hotels and offices.  The booming city of Dubai in the United Arab Emirates has also joined the skyscraper race.  While the ever-growing Burj Dubai is already the tallest man-made structure in the world, the Nakheel Tower is set to go even higher.  Developers suggest the finished building will be at least 1 km tall.  While in Europe, Paris is leading the skyscraper revolution -- plans for a 50-story building have been given the green light, which will make it the first skyscraper to be built in the city for 30 years.

{"article": "BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Four Americans -- two soldiers and two civilians from the Defense and State departments -- were killed Tuesday in a blast that rocked a municipal building in Baghdad's Sadr City, the U.S. Embassy said.  The attack also killed six Iraqis and wounded 10 others, an Iraqi Interior Ministry official said.  A second employee from the U.S. Defense Department also died, but that person wasn't an American. The employee was a dual Italian-Iraqi national, the Italian Foreign Ministry said.  The U.S. military said the blast struck a meeting of a district advisory council, a neighborhood group that looks at local needs and passes on its assessments to the provincial government.  The deputy head of the council was seriously injured, the Interior Ministry official said.  The U.S. military blamed Iranian-backed militants it calls Special Groups for the blast and detained three people in connection with the attack, including a suspect \"fleeing the scene [who] tested positive for explosive residue.\"  \"We believe the target of the attack was a high-ranking [district advisory council] member as well as the U.S. soldiers,\" said Lt. Col. Steve Stover, a U.S. military spokesman.  \"We believe the Special Groups criminals were upset that the DAC member was working with coalition forces to improve the quality of life for the southern Sadr City residents.\"  A statement from Ryan Crocker, U.S. ambassador to Iraq, identified the slain State Department employee as Steve Farley.  \"Mr. Farley was a member of our embedded Provincial Reconstruction Team for the Sadr City and Adhamiya districts of Baghdad City,\" the statement said.  \"We extend our deepest condolences to their families and friends, and our profound appreciation for the ultimate sacrifice that they made in service to their country and for the people of Iraq. This is a tragic loss and one we all mourn.\"  The U.S. Embassy statement didn't identify the other victims.  The blast dramatizes the perils the war still poses for Americans despite a Pentagon report Monday that touted a sharp decrease in violence in Iraq in recent months.  The explosion also marked the third strike in two days involving local politicians and political institutions in Baghdad.  A city councilman on Monday fired on U.S. forces at a municipal building southeast of the capital in the Salman Pak area and killed two soldiers.  Separately, the head of Abu Dsheer City Council in Baghdad's southern Dora area was gunned down at his home later Monday.  Last week, a bomb ripped through Baghdad's Hurriya district near a neighborhood advisory council meeting where U.S. troops were stationed, killing 63 people and wounding 71 others.  The U.S. military also blamed that attack on a Special Groups cell, but Stover couldn't say whether it was connected to Tuesday's blast.  \"Last week's event was an attempt to incite sectarian violence and hatred against the Iraqi Sunni population in an effort to keep them from returning to Hurriya,\" Stover said.  Sadr City, the scene of Tuesday's deadly blast, is a stronghold of Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr and where some of the capital's most intense fighting in recent months has occurred between Shiite militia members and Iraqi security forces.  A truce deal was reached last month between the Iraqi government and al-Sadr's followers, ending weeks of fighting and allowing the Iraqi army to enter Sadr City, but violence persists.  Al-Sadr recently announced his intention to develop a new fighting force that would battle U.S.-led forces in Iraq.  Many followers in al-Sadr's Mehdi Army militia have heeded a long-standing cease-fire, but some rogue forces are thought to be involved in violence.  \"This was the fourth meeting of this district council, led by hard-working Iraqis determined to make a difference and set Sadr City off on the right path. Special Groups are afraid of progress and afraid of empowering the people,\" Lt. Col. John Digiambatista of the 4th Infantry Division said in a news release, referring to Tuesday's attack.  Twenty-five U.S. troops have died in Iraq to date this month. There have been 4,109 deaths of U.S. service members since the war began.  Other developments  \u2022 Three U.S. soldiers and their Iraqi interpreter were killed Tuesday evening by a roadside bomb in northern Iraq's Nineveh Province, the U.S. military said. No other details were immediately released.  \u2022 A suicide car bomb went off near a police station in central Mosul Tuesday evening, killing a child, a police officer and wounding dozens more. Police and civilians, including women and children, were among the wounded, though injury reports varied from 90 to 70 to 57, according to the U.S. Military, Mosul police and the Iraq Interior Ministry, respectively. All three sources agreed on the death toll, however. Several houses were affected by the blast, which destroyed a coffee shop in a residential area.  \u2022 Earlier Tuesday, coalition troops in Mosul killed a senior-level al Qaeda in Iraq leader, the U.S. military said. The operation led to the killing of the group's \"emir\" of Mosul, the military said. A dozen people were detained in raids targeting the group in northern Iraq and Baghdad, the military said.  \u2022 U.S. troops raided a Shiite militant hideout Tuesday in southeastern Baghdad's Karrada district, capturing four suspects the military said were connected to recent attacks on coalition bases. A vehicle bomb being built in the hideout was destroyed, according to a coalition statement.  \u2022 Anbar province will soon be run by the Iraqi military. The U.S. military said it is transferring security responsibility this week to the Iraqis. Anbar is the 10th of the 18 provinces where Iraqi forces have taken charge of security control since 2003 and the first largely Sunni Arab province to do so.

{"article": " -- Nineteen political prisoners were released by the government of Myanmar over the weekend, the human rights group Amnesty International reported Tuesday.  Protesters demand democracy for Myanmar at a demonstration in New Delhi, India earlier this month.  Among those released was Ma Khin Khin Leh, who was serving a life sentence because her husband, a student activist, had helped plan a protest demonstration in Bago in July 1999, according to Amnesty International USA's Web blog  Authorities prevented the demonstration from taking place, but took the woman and her three-year-old daughter into custody after failing to find her husband, Amnesty International said.  The child was released after five days but her mom, a 33-year-old school teacher, was sentenced to life in prison.  \"Even by the normally harsh standards of 'justice' meted out by Myanmar's military government, the life sentence given to Ma Khin Khin Leh was extreme,\" the human rights organization said.  She was designated one of Amnesty International USA's priority cases. She was released with 18 others \"widely considered to be political prisoners,\" Amnesty International said.  Myanmar's military rulers have been widely condemned for their alleged human rights abuses.  Pro-democracy leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi has been confined in her home for 12 of the past 18 years. Her last house arrest began in 2003 and has been periodically renewed.  In October 2007, clashes erupted between pro-democracy demonstrators and government security forces. As many as 110 people are believed to have been killed in that crackdown, including 40 Buddhist monks.  The protests were sparked by a huge fuel price increase imposed by the military government, and quickly escalated. Myanmar's military junta said in mid-October that it had detained more than 2,900 people amid the clashes.  In September 2008, Amnesty International reported that Myanmar, also called Burma, had released seven dissidents, among them U Win Tin, a journalist and senior official in the opposition National League for Democracy who had been imprisoned for 19 years.", "Q": ["Q: When was Ma Khin Khin Leh sentenced to life in prison?

{"article": " -- A 22-year-old college student in Boston, Massachusetts, has been charged with murder in connection with the death of a woman who may have been contacted through a Craigslist ad, police said.  Police found Julissa Brisman, 26, unconscious with multiple gunshot wounds on April 14. She later died.  Philip Markoff, a pre-med student at Boston University with no criminal record, also was charged with the armed robbery and kidnapping of another victim, Police Commissioner Ed Davis announced Monday evening. Markoff, who was under police surveillance, was arrested earlier in the afternoon after a traffic stop south of the city, police said.  Markoff is suspected in the death of New York City resident Julissa Brisman, 26, who was found unconscious with multiple gunshot wounds at Boston's Copley Marriott Hotel on April 14. She was transferred to Boston Medical Center, where she died from her injuries shortly afterward.  Police said that Brisman, a model, offered massages via Craigslist, a popular online classified ads service.  The confrontation between Brisman and her killer seems to have begun as an attempted robbery, police said. \"It appears that there was a struggle between the victim and the suspect in the threshold of the hotel room immediately prior to the shooting,\" the Boston Police Department said in a statement posted on  its Web site.  Surveillance videos from the hotel where Brisman was murdered showed a tall, clean-cut young blonde man in a black windbreaker leaving the property, said the Boston Police Department, which had asked for the public's help in identifying the man.  Police did not release a photo of Markoff on Monday.  Four days before Brisman's killing, Markoff allegedly robbed a 29-year-old woman at gunpoint at a Westin Hotel in Boston, Suffolk County District Attorney Dan Conley said.  A police spokesman would not disclose the details of her Craigslist ad but said she and Brisman were \"involved in similar professions.\"  \"This is a compelling case with a myriad of evidence -- with computer evidence being a part of it,\" Conley said, adding that additional search warrants would be executed this week.  Markoff's arraignment was set for Tuesday morning at the Boston Municipal Court. It was not immediately clear if he had retained defense counsel.  Davis and Conley warned there may be other victims that come forward in the case.  \"We would like to make one final pitch to those out there who may have been a victim of robbery at the hands of Philip Markoff, especially those who may have used Craigslist in the manner in which the victim used Craigslist,\" he said.  Authorities received more than 150 leads in the case, which Davis credited to the popularity of the Web site.  \"The public came forth, they were fascinated by this crime,\" he said, adding, \"I wish we had this level of cooperation in every homicide that occurred.\"  Davis said Boston investigators were working with police in Warwick, Rhode Island, in what could be a related case.  On April 16 at a Holiday Inn Express in Warwick, Rhode Island, a man tied up and demanded money from a 26-year-old dancer who had posted a Craigslist advertisement, according to Warwick Police Chief Col. Stephen McCartney.  The robbery was interrupted when the woman's husband entered the room. After pointing his gun at the husband, the suspect fled, according to McCartney.  He said no conclusions could be made, but allowed that the incident \"may be related to similar crimes occurring in the Boston area.\"  Watch police say assailant is perusing Craigslist ads \u00bb  Craigslist CEO Jim Buckmaster said the company was \"horrified and deeply saddened that our community services have been associated in any way whatsoever with a crime of violence.\"  He promised that Craigslist would evaluate the incident to see if additional measures could be introduced to further protect users.

{"article": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- CIA interrogators used waterboarding at least 266 times on two top al Qaeda suspects, according to a Bush-era Justice Department memo released by the Obama administration.  Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, seen in a December sketch, was waterboarded 183 times in a month, a memo says.  The controversial technique that simulates drowning -- and which President Obama calls torture -- was used at least 83 times in August 2002 on suspected al Qaeda leader Abu Zubaydah, according to the memo.  Interrogators also waterboarded Khalid Sheikh Mohammed 183 times in March 2003. Mohammed is believed to be the mastermind behind the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States.  Obama released the memo Thursday, saying that \"exceptional circumstances surround these memos and require their release.\"  Watch other tactics outlined in memos \u00bb  The memo, dated May 30, 2005, was from then-Deputy Assistant Attorney General Steven G. Bradbury to John Rizzo, who was acting general counsel for the CIA.  It paints a different picture from the one described by former CIA officer John Kiriakou. In a December 2007 interview with CNN, Kiriakou said Zubaydah had been waterboarded for \"about 30 seconds, 35 seconds\" and agreed to cooperate with interrogators the following day.  In an interview on \"Fox News Sunday,\" Michael Hayden, who directed the CIA from 2006 to 2009, was asked about the number of times Mohammed was waterboarded.  Hayden denounced the release of the memos and did not comment on the number, saying it was his understanding that the frequency of waterboarding was among the operational details that had not been declassified.  Watch one expert say tactics 'worse than Abu Ghraib' \u00bb  The 2005 memo refers to a letter that had contained the numbers as well. Part of the reference to the letter was redacted in the released memo.  Waterboarding is among the interrogation tactics that Obama has prohibited through an executive order.  The CIA also has admitted waterboarding Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, the first person charged in the United States for the 2000 attack on the USS Cole in Yemen that killed 17 U.S. sailors.  Obama said last week he felt comfortable releasing the classified memos because the Bush administration acknowledged using some of the practices associated with the memos, and the interrogation techniques were widely reported and have since been banned.  \"Withholding these memos would only serve to deny facts that have been in the public domain for some time,\" Obama said in a statement. \"This could contribute to an inaccurate accounting of the past, and fuel erroneous and inflammatory assumptions about actions taken by the United States.\"  The president applauded the work of the U.S. intelligence community and said no one who \"carried out their duties relying in good faith upon legal advice from the Department of Justice\" would be prosecuted.", "Q": ["Q: who is Khalid Sheikh Mohammed ?

{"article": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Some experts are skeptical that anything could have stopped Robert Hawkins from going on a murderous rampage at an Omaha, Nebraska, shopping mall on Wednesday.  A police car sits outside the Westroads Mall in Omaha, Nebraska, on Thursday.  \"This is not something that anybody can reasonably anticipate,\" said Don Greene, a former FBI agent who has written a book on mall security.  \"If the people closest to him didn't see any indicators or signs that he was going to go off so drastically... how is some public safety officer supposed to recognize this person?\" Greene asked.  In fact, security at Omaha's Westroads Mall did find Hawkins' behavior suspicious before the shooting, Omaha Police Chief Thomas Warren said Thursday.  Mall surveillance initially flagged Hawkins \"based on his actions\" when he entered the mall through the Von Maur store's main entrance on the second floor, Warren said. He said Hawkins exited quickly after entering, then re-entered within six minutes and appeared to be concealing something in a balled-up sweatshirt.  He then went up the elevator to the third floor, and when he got there, he immediately began firing, Warren said.  \"It doesn't appear as though there was an opportunity for intervention,\" he said.  Shopping malls around the country were expected to review their emergency plans and consider additional security measures in light of Wednesday's shooting, which killed eight.  Watch what experts say about keeping malls safe \u00bb  \"There is always a fear of copycats when something like this happens,\" said Malachy Kavanaugh, spokesman for the International Council of Shopping Centers. He said malls would be considering whether to close some entrances, bring in additional officers, and make security more visible.  There are 1,200 enclosed malls in the United States and about 50,000 shopping centers. Although some include police substations, most are patrolled by unarmed private mall and store security guards.  Should these private security guards be armed? \"Absolutely not,\" said Greene. Greene said if a security officer were to pull a gun on an armed individual in a mall, it could result in \"the gunfight at the 'OK corral,' and then we might have 23 people killed instead of eight.\"  \"These random events are very challenging to prevent and difficult to deal with when they occur. Law enforcement and security prevention measures, no matter how good, cannot forestall a tragedy such as this from happening,\" said a statement issued Wednesday night by the Simon Property Group, which operates regional and outlet malls across the United States.  \"We do not disclose or discuss our enhanced security measures and/or procedures that we have in place or may institute at any given time, some of which are visible to the public, with others intentionally less noticeable,\" the statement said. \"Disclosure of such information could potentially compromise our efforts to provide a safe and secure environment.\"  Security expert Lou Palumbo told CNN one useful strategy was having trained law enforcement personnel watching people as they enter the mall.  \"You start to observe the people coming into the mall area,\" he said. \"To let them in your door and then try to figure out what they're doing, you know, it's not as effective as catching them as they're coming in the door.\"  The International Council of Shopping Centers has conducted focus groups with shoppers to test how they would react to even tighter \"airport style\" security measures, including bag checks and magnetometers.  According to Kavanaugh, the results have shown that shoppers would accept the measures only if the national threat advisory system was raised to its highest level, red. Such extreme measures are \"in the mall industry playbook... but it is something no one wants to do,\" said Kavanaugh.  While some mall owners have increased training of security personnel and have upgraded their emergency systems, many security experts believe more should and can be done. Those experts suggest it's a matter of money. They say until shoppers start staying away, mall owners will not make significant changes.  There are no national standards for security guards, and according to a 2006 study by the Police Foundation, only a few states require background checks, minimum hiring standards, or training.  The study also notes that drills to test security staffs' knowledge of what to do in an emergency, when done at all, \"are seldom rigorous, seldom done with first responders, and are usually done without clear standards to measure their success.\" The report goes on to say that \"many malls do not even have plans to limit access to sensitive areas in times of heightened alert.\"  Since that report was written, the International Council of Shopping Centers, in conjunction with George Washington University, has developed a DVD to train mall security guards. According to Kavanaugh, about 6,000 of the nation's estimated 20,000 mall security guards have participated in the course, including 10 at Westroads Mall, where Wednesday's shootings took place.  The FBI and other federal agencies have reached out to private security firms to share information on best practices. The FBI also sends out alerts regarding possible threats to the private sector -- but warnings of possible terrorist plans are clearly of no help in anticipating an attacker like Hawkins.

{"article": "LONDON, England (Reuters) -- Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe gains access to a reported \u00a320 million ($41.1 million) fortune as he turns 18 on Monday, but he insists the money won't cast a spell on him.  Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter in \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\"  To the disappointment of gossip columnists around the world, the young actor says he has no plans to fritter his cash away on fast cars, drink and celebrity parties.  \"I don't plan to be one of those people who, as soon as they turn 18, suddenly buy themselves a massive sports car collection or something similar,\" he told an Australian interviewer earlier this month. \"I don't think I'll be particularly extravagant.  \"The things I like buying are things that cost about 10 pounds -- books and CDs and DVDs.\"  At 18, Radcliffe will be able to gamble in a casino, buy a drink in a pub or see the horror film \"Hostel: Part II,\" currently six places below his number one movie on the UK box office chart.  Details of how he'll mark his landmark birthday are under wraps. His agent and publicist had no comment on his plans.  \"I'll definitely have some sort of party,\" he said in an interview. \"Hopefully none of you will be reading about it.\"  Radcliffe's earnings from the first five Potter films have been held in a trust fund which he has not been able to touch.  Despite his growing fame and riches, the actor says he is keeping his feet firmly on the ground.  \"People are always looking to say 'kid star goes off the rails,'\" he told reporters last month. \"But I try very hard not to go that way because it would be too easy for them.\"  His latest outing as the boy wizard in \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\" is breaking records on both sides of the Atlantic and he will reprise the role in the last two films.

{"article": "Cupertino, California (CNN) -- The iPhone 4S may not look any different from its predecessor, but it is Apple's only model with a sort of robot living inside.  Apple's new phone, which was announced on Tuesday to be sold in stores on October 14, will have a new function called Siri. The program lets people bark commands or ask questions to the phone, and it will provide an answer or ask follow-up questions in order to perform a given task.  At the news conference, Phil Schiller, Apple's marketing executive, called Siri \"the coolest feature of the new iPhone 4S,\" and the company is expected to advertise Siri heavily in its sales pitches.  Apple dedicated a significant chunk of the presentation to showing the extent of Siri's ability to interpret requests and respond. \"Do I need a raincoat today?\" incites a robo-female voice to reply: \"It sure looks like rain today,\" as Scott Forstall, Apple's mobile software executive, demonstrated.  Ask Siri to remind you to buy flowers for your wife at a certain time, and Siri may ask you to identify her in the phone's address book. Siri then remembers who she is for future requests, Forstall said. The software integrates with Yelp and WolframAlpha for relevant queries. It can also schedule appointments in the phone's calendar and transcribe e-mails or text messages.  With Google's Android phones, users can dictate messages, too, which are then transcribed by Google's servers. Other cell phones support voice commands, which is handy when operating a phone while driving, but few people take advantage of the option. Even the preceding iPhones had a basic version of this called Voice Control, which can be activated in the same way as Siri, by holding down the phone's home button.  But Apple's ambitions for Siri are much greater.  Steve Jobs has said that Siri's focus is on artificial intelligence. \"We like what they do a lot,\" the Apple co-founder and former CEO said at the AllThingsD conference last year.  Forstall echoed that onstage Tuesday, saying: \"I've been in the AI field a long time, and this still blows me away.\"  The big unveiling of the iPhone 4S on Tuesday was the first time most people learned about Siri, but the voice-assistant software is rooted in many years of extensive technical research.  The project was born at SRI International, a nonprofit research organization. It was a part of an ambitious project called CALO, for Cognitive Assistant that Learns and Organizes. The program was funded by the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the government division responsible for Global Position System (GPS) and developments that led to the creation of the Internet.  Work on Siri began in the summer of 2007, and SRI executives decided to spin out the project as a standalone business in 2008. Apple acquired the company in April 2010.  \"The team was so happy when Apple did the acquisition,\" Norman Winarsky, a Siri co-founder who remained at SRI, said in an interview on Monday. \"They have a vision.\"  Before joining Apple, Siri provided a free app for iOS mobile devices. Apple removed it from the App Store on Tuesday, which means only iPhone 4S owners will be able to access the service starting next week.  The version integrated into the 4S is vastly superior to the now-defunct app based on onstage demos. Apple spokespeople did not respond to CNN's requests to try the product at the event on Tuesday.  Siri's engineers were excited for the opportunity to bake their software deeply into the new iPhone and build features that a third-party developer would not be able to do because of Apple-imposed restrictions, Winarsky said.  \"We are going to be very proud,\" he said. \"The world of virtual personal assistants is going to be everywhere.\"  Siri's specialty is in its ability to interpret so-called natural-language requests. It was originally developed to handle typed queries, Winarsky said. For the voice transcription, Siri uses technology from Nuance Communications, Mike Thompson, an exec for Nuance's mobile division, said in an interview on Tuesday. Apple also licenses Nuance's voice transcription for features on the Mac.  Like Siri, Nuance was spun out from SRI.  \"We're thrilled with today's announcement,\" Thompson said. \"What you're seeing today is the beginning of the next generation [of mobile assistants]. That's really the deep integration and the totality of the experience.\"  For technologists, like Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, the ability to speak into a digital companion that can understand and respond is a sci-fi dream realized.  \"I don't like to learn programs' methods of doing everything,\" Wozniak said in a recent interview with CNN. \"I just want to speak it and have it happen.\"  Apple is betting that Siri's implementation of that will be a major selling point for the new phone. Despite no apparent technical limitations, the software will only be offered on the iPhone 4S at first.  \"Siri is compelling,\" AT&T Mobility CEO Ralph de la Vega said in an interview after the announcement. He indicated that he expected the feature would be a significant enough reason to spur current iPhone users to purchase the iPhone 4S.", "Q": ["Q: What is Apples iphone 4s voice assistant feature called?

{"article": "NEW YORK (CNN) -- A New York appeals court Thursday overturned terrorism convictions for a Yemeni cleric and his personal assistant, saying they did not receive a fair trial.  Sheik Mohammed Ali al-Moayad and Mohammed Mohsen Zayed, were sentenced in 2005 to 75 and 45 years in prison, respectively, after being convicted of conspiring to provide material support and resources to foreign terrorist organizations. They now can have new trials under a different judge.  The lawyer for al-Moayad, Robert Boyle, said, \"I'm extremely gratified at the court's decision. I believe it is legally and factually correct. I hope my client, who is elderly and not in good health, will be given the opportunity to return to his family in Yemen.\"  The three-judge panel was unanimous in its decision, citing evidentiary errors that likely influenced the outcome of the trial. The judges found that certain pieces of evidence presented by prosecutors were prejudicial and had the effect of denying al-Moayad and Zayed a fair trial.  Zayed and al-Moayad were arrested in 2003 in a sting operation that culminated in Germany. The government's case relied largely on secretly videotaped conversations between the defendants and a pair of undercover FBI informants at a Frankfurt hotel in 2003. One of the informants, Mohamed Alanssi, testified that al-Moayad boasted about giving money, weapons and recruits to al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.  The charges were brought in the Eastern District of New York because al-Moayad allegedly collected terrorist funds at the al-Farooq mosque in Brooklyn.  Now that the appeals court has vacated the convictions, prosecutors have the option of appealing to the U.S. Supreme Court if they feel there is a constitutional issue. They can retry the case or move to dismiss.  Al-Moayad, who is in his 60s, is incarcerated at the Supermax prison in Florence, Colorado, as is Zayed. Boyle said he had called the prison and as of 4 p.m. Thursday was still waiting to speak to his client.

{"article": "BOGOTA, Colombia (CNN) -- Marxist guerrillas admit they recently killed eight Indians whom the rebels accused of collaborating with the Colombian government, media outlets reported Tuesday.  In Bogota, Colombia, last week, Luis Evelis Andrade denounces the killings of Indians by FARC rebels.  Human rights organizations and a state governor last week had accused the the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, better known as FARC, of killing at least 27 Awa Indians in southwest Colombia in the past two weeks.  The FARC issued a statement dated February 11 saying the guerrillas detained and \"executed\" eight people on February 6 in the town of Rio Bravo because the Indians were gathering information about the rebels to give to the Colombian military. The FARC statement was posted Tuesday by the New Colombia News Agency and Caracol Radio's Web site.  The statement said the guerrillas were not targeting indigenous populations but took the action \"against people who independent of their race, religion, ethnicity, social condition etc. accepted money and put themselves at the service of the army in an area that is the object of military operations.\"  The FARC communication also urged the Indians not to be manipulated by government officials who say the guerrillas are out to harm indigenous populations.  \"They know of our respect for the civil community,\" the statement said, adding that a government that \"never has looked out for these indigenous communities and has plunged them into war can't be their defenders. They are their executioners!\"  Last week, Colombian President Alvaro Uribe called the FARC \"executioners\" for killing Indians.  \"Let the world know: The Democratic Security [forces] protect the indigenous because it is for all Colombians,\" Uribe said. \"And the FARC deceive the country, they assassinate the indigenous.\"  The governor of Narino state, Navarro Wolff, said last week the FARC had killed 10 Awa in one incident a few days earlier and 17 others the previous week.  Luis Evelis Andrade of the National Indigenous Organization of Colombia, known by its Spanish acronym ONIC, said the FARC had targeted the Awa because the Indians don't want to get involved in the armed struggle and refuse to reveal information on government troop actions.  Speaking on Caracol TV, ONIC said the FARC has abducted 120 Awa since February 4 and 44 Awa have been killed this year.  Others also shared their concern.  \"We are very worried about the Awa community,\" said Monsignor Gustavo Giron Higuita, the bishop of the city of Tumaco. \"It is a community that is pretty unprotected and that in the past five years has received a type of persecution by armed groups.\"  The Awa, he said, \"are pacifist, want respect of their organization and want to regain their traditions. We have been accompanying them in this process, and that's why this hurts so much.\"  Colombian Attorney General Alejandro Ordonez Maldonado ordered the nation's human rights commissioner to launch an investigation and take steps to help the Awa.  The Human Rights Watch organization said Wednesday that the guerrillas tortured some of the Awa before killing them with knives.  \"These cruel killings violate the most basic principles of human decency and dignity,\" said Jose Miguel Vivanco, the Americas director at Human Rights Watch. \"There is no possible excuse or justification for these horrific actions.\"  Monsignor Ruben Salazar Gomez, the president of the Episcopal Conference of Colombia, joined last week's chorus of criticism, calling the killings a \"very grave... crime the whole country should condemn.\"  New York-based Human Rights Watch said in a release that group members have made numerous visits to Narino, which is one of Colombia's 32 departments, or states. Narino is in southwest Colombia, on the Pacific Ocean and the border with Ecuador.  The area has a heavy presence of various armed groups and Colombian military forces and has among the worst human rights conditions in Colombia, the human rights group said. The Awa territories have been particularly affected.  The Colombian government has issued a \"risk report\" warning that civilians in the region are in danger.  The FARC is said to have \"confined\" some villages, cutting them off from the outside world and not allowing anyone to enter or leave.  The FARC, the largest and oldest guerrilla group in Colombia, has been waging war against the government since the 1960s.  Security analysts say the FARC has about 9,000 to 12,000 armed guerillas and several thousand supporters, mostly in rural areas.  The guerrilla group operates mostly in Colombia but has carried out extortion, kidnappings, bombings and other activities in Venezuela, Panama and Ecuador.", "Q": ["Q: What was the reason for FARC to target the specific group that they did?

{"article": "ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Air traffic delays began to clear up Tuesday evening after computer problems left travelers across the United States waiting in airports, the Federal Aviation Administration said.  Flights at Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport were delayed Tuesday afternoon.  Airports experienced hours of flight delays Tuesday afternoon after a communications breakdown at a Federal Aviation Administration facility, the administration said.  The facility south of Atlanta had problems processing data, requiring that all flight-plan information be processed through a facility in Salt Lake City, Utah, overloading that facility.  The two facilities process all flight plans for commercial and general aviation flights in the United States, FAA spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen said.  Delays had begun to clear by 5 p.m. ET. By 6 p.m., the administration said minimal delays remained as the Salt Lake facility began processing requests closer to normal speed.  \"The situation is pretty much resolved,\" FAA spokeswoman Diane Spitaliere said.  At about 9:30 p.m. ET, most major airports were reporting flights departing on time or with less than 15-minute delays. Newark International was still reporting delays of up to 1 hour and 45 minutes and LaGuardia Airport in New York reported 45-minute delays -- although weather problems were cited as the main problem.  John F. Kennedy International in New York and Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International were reporting delays of up to 30 minutes, although both of those airports also had experienced thunderstorms and other weather-related difficulties.  The administration said there were no radar outages and said it had not lost contact with any planes during the computer glitch. The roughly 5,000 flights that were in the air when the breakdown happened were not affected, just those that were waiting to take off. iReporter stuck in Philadelphia  \"This is really not a safety issue, this is an aggravation issue,\" CNN aviation expert Miles O'Brien said.  Watch Miles O'Brien track the delays \u00bb  The problem appeared similar to a June 8, 2007, computer issue that caused severe flight delays and some cancellations along the East Coast. iReport.com: Are you stuck at the airport?  iReporter Stephanie McCauley sat on the tarmac for more than an hour at Baltimore/Washington International Airport on Tuesday on a flight bound for Albany, New York.  \"It happens. It's just weird, because you're sitting, and you don't know if it's going to be 20 minutes or 2 hours,\" McCauley said.  Cheryl Stewart, spokeswoman for Baltimore/Washington International Airport, said that as of about 3:40 p.m., some flights were being allowed to take off, but the FAA was no longer accepting new flight plans.  \"We're just kind of waiting for further word,\" Stewart said.  On the FAA's Web site, delays were being reported at all 40 airports on the administration's primary flight information map.  The worst delays were in the Northeast, Bergen said. Chicago's Midway and O'Hare airports in Illinois were reporting delays of up to 90 minutes.  The Web site, which normally lists the length of expected flight delays, was no longer listing that information Tuesday afternoon.

{"article": "NEW ORLEANS, Louisiana (CNN) -- Before a cheering crowd at a town hall meeting in New Orleans, President Obama fired back at critics who accuse him of accomplishing little in his nine months in office, saying \"I'm just getting started.\"  President Obama speaks at a town hall meeting at the University of New Orleans on Thursday.  \"I never thought any of this was going to be easy,\" said Obama, speaking at the University of New Orleans in his first visit to the Gulf Coast city since taking office. He poked fun at his critics, asking, \"Why haven't you solved world hunger yet? It's been nine months. Why?\"  \"What'd I say during the campaign? I said change is hard,\" Obama said. \"Big change is harder.... I wasn't kidding about it being hard.\"  \"Those folks who are trying to stand in the way of progress... let me tell you, I'm just getting started,\" he said. \"I don't quit. I'm not tired. I'm just getting started.\"  Before taking questions, Obama discussed the recovery effort in New Orleans, a city struggling to get back on its feet after Hurricane Katrina.  \"It has now been just over four years since that terrible storm struck your shores,\" the president said. \"And [in] the days after it did, this nation and all the world bore witness to the fact that the damage from Katrina was not caused just by a disaster of nature, but also by a breakdown of government, that government wasn't adequately prepared and we didn't appropriately respond.\"  Obama said that when he took office, he pledged to make Gulf Coast rebuilding efforts and disaster response top priorities of his administration.  \"So far, I'm pleased to report that we've made good progress,\" he said. \"We've got a long way to go, but we've made progress.\"  He said he has sent more Cabinet members to the Gulf Coast than any other region -- \"not just to appearances, but to listen and to learn and help you move forward.\" Also, he said, his administration has helped eliminate red tape and turf disputes in order to get stalled programs moving, and freed up $1.5 billion in recovery funds.  He said his administration is tackling \"corruption and inefficiency\" that has plagued the New Orleans Housing Authority for years -- remarks that drew applause from the crowd -- and has helped move families out of emergency housing, helping homeowners rebuild and helping renters find affordable options.  The government has also invested in supporting health centers and recruiting primary care providers, nurses and other professionals to fill shortages left by the 2005 hurricane, he said.  Watch bloggers debate Obama's handling of New Orleans \u00bb  Before the meeting, Obama toured the Martin Luther King charter school -- the first charter school to reopen in New Orleans' Ninth Ward, the hardest-hit portion of the city. The president called the school \"an inspiration for this city.\"  However, \"it's clear how far we have to go before we can call this recovery a real success,\" he said, adding that much remains to be done to repair roads, hospitals and schools and rebuild neighborhoods.  \"We will not forget about New Orleans,\" he said. \"We're going to keep on working.\"  He also touched on the economy and on health care reform. \"Too many Americans have waited too long for this to happen,\" he said, drawing wild cheers from the crowd. \"We are going to pass health care reform by the end of the year.\"  Meeting the challenges faced by the nation, he said, \"requires diligence and perseverance and patience... it requires a renewed spirit of cooperation among our citizens.\"  He took questions from the crowd on topics ranging from the school dropout rate to immigration.  One man asked Obama, \"Why is it four years after Katrina we're still fighting with the federal government for money to repair our devastated city?... I expected as much from the Bush administration, but why are we still being nickeled and dimed in our recovery?\"  The president responded, \"I make no excuses for the fact that the federal government did not work effectively with state and local governments immediately in the aftermath of the storm to make sure that everybody got the help they needed right away. And we are still working through the backlog of problems that existed.\"  \"My expectation is that by the time that my term is over, you guys are going to look back and you're going to say, 'This was a responsive administration on health care, on housing, on education, that actually made sure the money flowed and that things got done the way they were supposed to get done,\" he said.  A fourth-grade boy asked Obama his final question: \"Why do people hate you? They're supposed to love you. And God is love.\"  \"Well, now, first of all, I did get elected president, so not everybody hates me now,\" Obama said. \"... If you were watching TV lately, it seems like everybody's just getting mad all the time.... Some of it is just what's called politics, where, you know, once one party wins, then the other party kind of feels like it needs to poke you a little bit to keep you on your toes.\"  In addition, he told the boy, some people have lost their jobs and are frustrated. \"When you're president of the United States, you've got to deal with all of that,\" he said. \"... I'm a pretty tough guy. Are you a tough guy?\"  Four years after Katrina, evidence of the storm's devastation lingers. About 1,500 people in Louisiana are still living in temporary housing, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, although that is down from a high of more than 90,000.  And the Army Corps of Engineers is only a third of the way through a $15 billion system to provide 100-year flood protection for the city.  However, the agency says 76 disputed projects in Louisiana have been resolved since Obama took office, and more than $1.4 billion in aid has been sent to Louisiana, along with more than $160 million to Mississippi. And it says that more than 89,000 Louisiana households and 45,044 Mississippi households displaced by Katrina -- and by Hurricane Rita, which hit a month later -- have found longer-term housing solutions.  The emergency agency also says more than $1 billion from the stimulus program has been targeted for New Orleans.  The Obama administration's efforts have been praised. In August, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, a Republican, told the New Orleans Times-Picayune newspaper, \"there is a sense of momentum and a desire to get things done.\"  Still, the length and nature of Obama's visit Thursday drew some ire. The president was to spend less than four hours in New Orleans and will not visit other areas of the Gulf Coast affected by Katrina, such as the Mississippi coast.  \"The people of New Orleans deserve more than a 'drive-through daiquiri' summit with the president,\" Rep. Steve Scalise, R-Louisiana, said in a news conference Monday.  And Sen. David Vitter, R-Louisiana, wrote in a letter to Obama that \"if the town hall is the only major event of the visit, I truly think it will be deeply disappointing to most citizens.\"  The White House said that Obama has been to New Orleans five times since Katrina, and that since Obama took office, there have been 35 trips to the Gulf Coast by more than 20 senior administration officials.  \"The president made a promise to come to New Orleans and wanted to fulfill that promise as soon as his schedule allowed,\" White House spokesman Nicholas Shapiro said.", "Q": ["Q: What was said at the university?

{"article": "KIEV, Ukraine (CNN) -- A planned missile defense system in Eastern Europe poses no threat to Russia, President George Bush said Tuesday, responding to concerns that the U.S. might use interceptor missiles for offensive purposes.  President Bush, with President Viktor Yushchenko, praised Ukraine's democratic and military reforms.  \"The missile defense system is not aimed at Russia,\" Bush said at a news conference in Kiev following talks with the Ukrainian president. \"It's viewed as an anti-Russian device. Well, it's not.\"  His comments came before he left Kiev for a NATO summit in Bucharest, Romania, that is expected to highlight divisions over the plan. The summit begins Wednesday.  Russia and some European countries have expressed concerns about the missile defense system. While Poland and the Czech Republic have agreed to host parts of the system, others in Europe share Russian concerns that the defensive shield could be used for offensive aims.  Outside the U.S. Embassy in Kiev on Monday, protesters gathered to denounce Bush's visit. They chanted, thrust signs into the air -- one reading, \"Yankee Go Home\" -- and burned an effigy of Bush in the street.  Watch the demonstration \u00bb  The U.S. has tried to dissuade opposition over the plan. Washington offered to allow Russian monitors at the missile sites and to negotiate limits to the system over time. The United States also told Russia the system would not be operational until Iran test-fires a missile that could threaten Europe.  Many European countries don't believe the U.S. assertion that the system is needed to guard against imminent threats from Iran or North Korea. Europe is dependent on Russia for at least 40 percent of its oil and is reluctant to upset the Kremlin.  The issue will likely be divisive at this week's three-day NATO summit, where Russian President Vladimir Putin plans to make a rare appearance. Putin normally declines invitations to attend.  Bush is slated to meet Sunday with Putin in the Russian resort city of Sochi on the Black Sea, according to RIA Novosti. It will be the last meeting between the two men before the outgoing Russian president steps down, the Russian news agency reported.  Russia also is unhappy with NATO's eastward march. The alliance has already welcomed former Soviet republics such as Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. Bush is pushing hard for Georgia and Ukraine to join NATO as well.  Before leaving Tuesday for Bucharest, Bush said that Russia will not be able to veto Georgia's or Ukraine's inclusion into NATO.  Bush said that both countries should be able to take part in NATO's Membership Action Plan, or MAP, which is designed to help aspiring countries meet the requirements of joining the alliance.  \"I strongly believe that Ukraine and Georgia should be given MAP,\" Bush said. \"And there's no tradeoffs, period.\"  The U.S. president further said he was working \"as hard as I can\" to ensure the two countries are accepted into the MAP and that Russia will have no power to block their inclusion.  In remarks last month, former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Steven Pifer told the U.S. Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe that NATO \"has long made clear that any decision regarding membership is between NATO and the country concerned, and not subject to veto by any third party.\"  Russia is not a NATO member but works with the alliance via the NATO-Russia Council. Russia's concerns also align with those of some NATO members who oppose welcoming Georgia and Ukraine into the fold.  Pifer said last month that NATO should strive to maintain good relations with Russia, but \"should not allow Moscow a veto, either explicit or tacit, over relations between the alliance and third countries.\"  Allowing Russia a say, Pifer said, \"would encourage those in Russia who wish to reassert a Russian-led post-Soviet bloc rather than develop a relationship of cooperation and full partnership with Europe and the West.\"  Bush said he phoned Putin recently to reassure him on both issues.  \"NATO is an organization that's peaceful. NATO is an organization that helps democracies flourish. And democracies are good things to have on your border,\" Bush said he told Putin.  Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko said his country should be able to start the NATO membership process.  \"We are not speaking about joining NATO; we are only speaking about MAP,\" he said at the news conference. \"Why should Ukraine be deprived of that sovereign right, since the principle of open doors is the basic principle for NATO?\"  Bush added that Ukraine already contributes to NATO missions, specifically in Iraq, Afghanistan and Kosovo. Ukraine also has demonstrated a commitment to democracy, he said.  Responding to a reporter's question, Bush denied that the United States might ease off on membership plans for Ukraine and Georgia if Russia acquiesces on the missile shield.  Both issues threaten to destabilize NATO, said Jane Sharp of the Center for War Studies at King's College London, but she has heard particularly sharp criticism of the missile defense plan.  \"Somebody in the UK Ministry of Defense said to me, 'We are being dragged along on this missile defense thing to the American trough like pigs with rings in our noses,'\" Sharp said. \"It's a nuisance for Europeans, and I think they are irritated with the Czechs and the Poles for trying to do deals with the Americans.\" E-mail to a friend.", "Q": ["Q: What is the goal of the US president?

{"article": "(InStyle) -- It all boils down to this. It doesn't really matter all that much what hot, nubile French maverick has set the fashion world on fire. Or which Milanese visionary has a new fabric technique discovered during a life-changing trip to Angkor Wat that's sure to bring back sixties minimalism with a twist. Or that so-and-so has signed a deal to develop boutique spa hotels around the globe in former monasteries. Because, in the end, he's Ralph Lauren, and we're not.  Ralph Lauren has his eye on China and Japan.  For four decades no other designer has had a greater impact, not only on the way American men and women dress but also on the way they imagine, seek and indulge in the Good Life, than the former tie salesman from the Bronx.  \"Those ties were handmade, by the way,\" recalls Lauren. \"Back then, ties, even designer ones, didn't sell for more than $5 apiece. Mine were $12 to $15. Such luxury in something so simple was revolutionary.\"  And ironic. Because while no other designer logo exemplifies aspiration in the home of the free and the brave like the mallet-wielding guy on the pony, Lauren originally named his company Polo because \"it was the sport of kings. It was glamorous, sexy and international.\"  See his designs \u00bb  In the beginning a few people questioned if it was named after Marco Polo -- but today the fact that virtually none of Lauren's millions of devoted customers has ever even seen a polo match is immaterial. Lauren instinctively caught something that was in the air before any of his competitors had a chance to grab it -- the desire, not just to be a success but to look like one before you'd even achieved your goal.  What's more, Lauren made it look as easy as Fred Astaire dancing down a staircase.  \"What matters the most to me are clothes that are consistent and accessible,\" says the designer.  \"When I look at the people I've admired over the years, the ultimate stars, like Frank Sinatra, Cary Grant and Astaire, the ones who last the longest are the ones whose style has a consistency, whose naturalness is part of their excitement. And when you think of the blur of all the brands that are out there, the ones you believe in and the ones you remember, like Chanel and Armani, are the ones that stand for something. Fashion is about establishing an image that consumers can adapt to their own individuality. And it's an image that can change, that can evolve. It doesn't reinvent itself every two years.\"  However, with a media that is insatiable for the new, the now and the next, being steadfast doesn't always make for good copy.  \"The spotlight is always going to search for the newcomer,\" Lauren admits. \"And that's fine. But the key to longevity is to keep doing what you do better than anyone else. We work real hard at that. It's about getting your message out to the consumer. It's about getting their trust, but also getting them excited, again and again. My clothes -- the clothes we make for the runway -- aren't concepts. They go into stores. Our stores. Thankfully, we have lots of them,\" says Lauren.  \"What I rely on is people walking into my store saying, 'I want your clothes.'\"  Well, if all of Lauren's customers shouted that together, he would go deaf faster than he could pull on one of his classic pullovers.  Lauren's effortless luxury is all over the red carpet, on ski slopes and boats, at Wimbledon and elsewhere. It furnishes living rooms and graces dinner tables. It's on the bed, in the bed and under the bed -- and now sits on coffee tables, thanks to the tome Ralph Lauren (Rizzoli), celebrating his 40-years-and-growing career.  But far from giving his customary over-the-head wave and riding off into his Colorado-ranch sunset, the designer is going even more global.  \"Americans have a real inferiority about their own style. We've brought sportswear to the world, and yet we have a long way to go.\"  Already in Milan, London, Paris and Moscow, Lauren has more stores planned for China, Japan... oh, everywhere. \"There aren't enough Americans out there,\" he says. Who better to start with than Ralph? Just as long as he doesn't let on that most of us still can't play a lick of polo.

{"article": " -- The U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan has a unique r\u00e9sum\u00e9: he served two tours in the country as a general, training Afghan police and troops, before trading his uniform for a diplomat's business suit.  His career history may give Karl Eikenberry's word particular weight as President Obama struggles to come up with a way forward in Afghanistan.  Eikenberry sent private cables to Obama last week, urging the president not to rush to send more troops to Afghanistan -- although the top U.S. military commander there, Gen. Stanley McChrystal, wants 40,000 more pairs of boots on the ground.  Initial reports about the cables sent by Eikenberry appeared in The New York Times, Washington Post and Los Angeles Times. All three newspapers attributed the reports to senior U.S. officials, without identifying them. Two U.S. officials confirmed to CNN that Eikenberry sent two cables to Washington expressing reservations about troop increases amid uncertainty over President Hamid Karzai's government.  Neither Eikenberry nor the White House would comment on the contents of private advice between the envoy and the president, but the reports alarmed Karzai enough that his office sought confirmation from the U.S. Embassy about them, a Karzai spokesman told CNN.  Karzai's office did not get the information it sought, the spokesman said.  Whatever Eikenberry told the president, the ambassador is unusually well versed in the military problems facing Afghanistan.  He retired from the Army after nearly 40 years of service with the rank of lieutenant general on April 28 -- one day before he was sworn in as ambassador, according to his State Department biography.  His long military career included time in Kabul as U.S. security coordinator and chief of the Office of Military Cooperation.  \"Afghanistan has been at the center of my career since 9/11, when the terrorist-commandeered aircraft crashed into the Pentagon just below the office in which I was working,\" Eikenberry said at his Senate confirmation hearing in March.  \"There is no silver bullet and no quick, cheap or easy solutions. There is no substitute for more resources and sacrifice,\" he said then.  But, he added: \"There is no exclusively military solution to the issues we and our partners confront in Afghanistan.\"  He also advised the U.S. secretary of defense on China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Mongolia, and was deputy director for strategy, plans and policy on the Army staff.  But he's not new to embassy life, having served as defense attache at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, China.  Eikenberry has a master's degree in east Asian studies from Harvard, an advanced degree in Chinese history from Nanjing University in China, and is a certified translator from Mandarin Chinese.  He's also clearly attached to his wife, Ching, insisting in his Senate confirmation hearing that she accompany him to Kabul even though State Department rules barred spouses because the country is so dangerous.  He prevailed.

{"article": " -- Now that Caylee Anthony's remains have been identified, the search for the Florida toddler turns into a prosecution of her mother.  Casey Anthony, 22, is accused of killing her daughter. Investigators say her alibi didn't check out.  Although Orange County, Florida, Medical Examiner Jan Garavaglia said Friday she could not determine how Caylee died, she concluded the death was a homicide.  The child's mother, Casey Anthony, 22, faces charges including murder in the disappearance and death of Caylee, who was 2 when she vanished last summer.  The remains were found last week in woods about a half-mile from Anthony's parents' house and identified through DNA testing.  See where Caylee's skeleton was found \u00bb  On Saturday, investigators finished 10 days of sifting through the crime scene and served a warrant at the Anthony house for a third search for evidence, said Capt. Angelo Nieves of the Orange County sheriff's department. Cindy and George Anthony, the child's grandparents, were present for the search.  The mother's defense team had claimed since her October indictment that the child might still be alive, even claiming witnesses spotted Caylee since her disappearance.  The finding of the body \"has really cut the legs out of the defense,\" Stacey Honowitz, an assistant Florida state's attorney, said Friday night on CNN's \"Larry King Live.\"  Watch experts size up the legal case \u00bb  The lack of a cause of death and the absence of any soft tissue on the toddler's skeletal remains poses a challenge for prosecutors, forensic expert Lawrence Kobilinsky, a defense consultant for Casey Anthony, told Larry King.  \"If you don't have a cause of death, isn't it possible that it might have been an accident?\" Kobilinsky said.  A murder conviction would require proof the victim was killed intentionally. Legal experts say duct tape reportedly found on the body could convince a judge or jury that Caylee's death was not an accident.  Perhaps of greater significance, though, is Casey Anthony's behavior since -- and even before -- her child went missing.  According to earlier reports, Caylee was the result of an unintended pregnancy, and Anthony made an attempt to give her up after birth. She referred to Caylee as \"the little snot head\" and continued to maintain an active social life.  Follow a timeline of the case \u00bb  When Caylee went missing, Anthony did not tell her family for a month. It was the child's grandmother who called police. Anthony told conflicting stories at the beginning of the investigation, including a tale that Caylee was with a nanny. The name and address turned out to be bogus. As police searched for Caylee, they say Anthony's active social life continued -- including one memorable evening dancing at an Orlando bar that was hosting \"Hot Body Contest.\"   Investigators said they found the scent of decomposing flesh and a trace of chloroform, a powerful knockout agent, in the trunk of a car Anthony drove at the time. Anthony's family offered various explanations, including a rotting pizza and a dead squirrel.  Watch a tribute to the little girl \u00bb  On the Anthonys' home computer, police found there had been searches for chloroform, missing children and \"neck-breaking,\" although Garavaglia said Friday that she did not find evidence of trauma to the bones.  \"The prosecution is going to have a great deal of circumstantial evidence, and this is a physical evidence case,\" Kobilinsky said. \"This is not a question about credibility, although obviously a jury looks at credibility and contradictions, but the physical evidence will either include her or exclude Casey. It's an uphill battle for the defense.\"  Nevertheless, forensic expert Kathy Reichs, who also is working with Anthony's defense team, sees an opening.  \"Given that there's no evidence as to the cause of death,... you could have an accidental death and a mother that panics,\" she told King. \"There are alternative explanations.\"  Perhaps not enough to save Anthony, said famed defense attorney Mark Geragos, who is not associated with the case.  \"The defense will try to focus, I'm sure, on all of the forensic evidence and whatever else they can do,\" he told King. \"But they're always going to be up against it with the 'She didn't act right' evidence, and that's the hardest thing to combat in this case.\"  Prosecutors don't need to show what killed Caylee, Geragos said. The defense needs to overcome Casey Anthony's statements and behavior.  \"Somebody is going to have to give an explanation at some point as to when she last saw the child, who she gave the child to,\" he said. \"And until that is done, I don't care what they put together, it's not going to carry any weight.\"", "Q": ["Q: What is the name of the defendant?

{"article": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- Videos of the chaos and horrified reactions after the July 7, 2005, London transit bombings were shown to jurors Thursday in the trial of three men charged with conspiracy in the case.  Smoke and dust fill the platform area at Liverpool Street Station on July 7, 2005, after a bomb exploded.  One of the videos shows the explosion of a train seconds after it leaves the Liverpool Street Station heading for Aldgate East. As dust and smoke fill the tunnel, people on the platform rush away, and police head toward the blast.  Another shows bystanders running and ducking for cover after one of the bombers detonated his rucksack on the No. 30 bus. Riders on a nearby bus jump from their seats.  Four bombs were detonated on underground trains at Liverpool Street, Russell Square and Edgware Road, and on a double-decker bus at Tavistock Square. Fifty-two people and the four bombers were killed, and at least 900 people were injured.  Watch commuters flee as the bombs explode \u00bb  Links to the edited videos were posted on the Web site of London's Metropolitan Police, and were played in Kingston Crown Court where Mohammed Shakil, 31, Waheed Ali, 24, and Sadeer Saleem, 27, are accused of aiding the bombers  A series of videos show three of the bombers -- Siddique Khan, Shehzad Tanweer and Jermaine Lindsay -- practicing their moves in various locations on June 28, 2005. The fourth bomber was Hasib Hussain.  One video shows Tanweer and Khan meeting Lindsay outside Luton Station, where the three linger near the ticket counter and one of them stands in line.  Security cameras also captured images of the three men at other blast locations.  Two weeks after the July bombings, an attempted second wave of bombings struck other trains and a bus, but the devices failed to explode properly. More than a dozen people were arrested afterward.

{"article": " -- A part-time actor has been accused of killing his neighbor and then luring the victim's friend to her death in an attempt to cover up his crime, authorities in California said.  The Costa Mesa Police Department last week charged Daniel Wozniak, 27, with two counts of murder. Wozniak is being held without bail and will be arraigned June 25, said Farrah Emami, spokesperson for the Orange County District Attorney's Office.  Wozniak has been accused in the shooting death of Samuel Herr, 26, and Juri Kibuishi, 23, of Irvine, police said.  According to investigators, Wozniak and Herr, who lived in the same residential complex in Costa Mesa, drove to the Los Alamitos Joint Forces Training Base on Friday, May 21. It is at the base that Wozniak shot and killed Herr for financial gain, police said.  The suspect cut off Herr's head, left arm and right hand and discarded the body parts at a park in Long Beach, police said.  After the slaying, Wozniak used Herr's cell phone to text Kibuishi and arrange for her to come to Herr's apartment, investigators alleged.  Shortly after midnight on May 22, Kibuishi arrived at the Herr's home, where she was shot and killed by Wozniak, police said.  \"Wozniak then staged the crime scene to appear as if a sexual assault had occurred by partially removing her clothing,\" police said in a statement.  In addition, investigators said a 17-year-old individual was directed by Wozniak to make several ATM withdrawals using Herr's bank card.  Several law enforcement agencies, including the FBI, have been assisting the Costa Mesa Police.  From April 23 to May 23, Wozniak starred in a local theater's production of the musical \"Nine.\"  In a statement, the Hunger Artists Theatre Company said, \"We at Hunger Artists are horrified and saddened by the deaths of Juri Kibuishi and Samuel Eliezer Herr.

{"article": "New York (CNN) -- A Picasso painting fetched nearly $106.5 million at auction Tuesday, a record for any single work of art, Christie's New York said.  \"Nude, Green Leaves and Bust\" sold for $106,482,500 to an unidentified telephone bidder, the auction house said in a news release.  \"Silence fell over the packed saleroom as Christopher Burge conducted nine minutes of bidding that involved eight clients,\" it said. \"Christie's lead auctioneer took bids from a client in the saleroom as well as those on the phone before the competition settled down to two bidders at the $88 million mark and a one-on-one battle ensued. The final bid was hammered down at 7.32 p.m. at $95 million.\"  The buyer's premium -- the additional fee paid to the auction house -- took the price of the painting to $106.5 million.  \"Nude, Green Leaves and Bust,\" or \"Nu au Plateau de Sculpteur,\" is from the collection of Los Angeles philanthropist Frances Lasker Brody, who died last November and was the wife of the real estate developer Sidney F. Brody. The collection, amassed primarily during the 1940s and 1950s, had been in the family's home since.  Experts had referred to the 1932 work as \"lost\" because it had never been published in color. It shows Picasso's muse and mistress, Marie-Therese Walter.  The previous highest price for a work at auction was $104,327,006 paid for \"L'Homme Qui Marche I, bronze\" (Walking Man 1), 1960, by Alberto Giacometti. It sold during an auction at Sotheby's to an anonymous telephone bidder in February, 2010.  The previous high for a Picasso was $104,168,000 for \"Garcon a la Pipe\" (\"Boy with Pipe\"), 1905, in May 2004.  Those who missed a chance to bid on the Picasso can bid on its prior owners' 2.27-acre estate in the Holmby Hills neighborhood of Los Angeles. The 11,500-square-foot, five-bedroom, four-staff bedroom house was built in 1950 and is listed at $24.95 million, according to Coldwell Banker Previews International.", "Q": ["Q: What does the painting show?

{"article": "NEW YORK (CNN) -- Kenneth Cole is the first to admit he has a bit of a language problem.  Pun-loving Kenneth Cole pays tribute to inspiring people in his new book.  \"I need to distort not just leather and fabric, but also words,\" he said. \"It's a disorder I have.\"  The pun-loving fashion designer has raised plenty of eyebrows with advertising copy that ranges from the provocative and the political to the lighthearted and cutesy.  Browse his online store and you can buy a T-shirt that reads \"In war is it who's right, or who's left?\" A canvas tote bag says, \"Use me again and again and again... (I'm used to it).\"  Should you purchase either product, you're assured that all your money will go to Cole's \"Awearness Fund,\" an initiative designed to draw attention to social issues like homelessness and AIDS.  To that end, Cole has just released a new book called \"Awearness: Inspiring Stories About How to Make a Difference\" (DK Adult). It's a collection of essays from influential types intended to encourage readers to get involved in service and volunteerism in their communities.  Watch Cole talk about 'Awearness' \u00bb  Former President Bill Clinton contributes a piece on the global fight against HIV/AIDS. Actress Rosario Dawson writes about empowering young Latinos to vote, and cyclist Lance Armstrong discusses the merits of starting a movement like Livestrong, his effort to energize the fight against cancer.  As Cole says: \"No good deed should go unpublished.\" Pun intended.  The book commemorates 25 years in the fashion business for the New Yorker, as well as a quarter century as an advocate for social activism.  Cole spoke to CNN about the book, the belief, his wife and the cover. (OK, so not everyone is brilliantly punny.) The following is an edited transcript of the interview.  CNN: What is the big message you're hoping to get across with this book?  Kenneth Cole: The message is that these are extraordinary times. They're transformative in so many ways. And America recently expressed the reality that there is an appetite for meaningful, significant, social change like we've never seen before.  CNN: In the introduction of your book, you talk about how you've met a lot of people who have inspired you. Is there one person who stands out above the rest?  Cole: There are so many people that inspire me, and there are 90 role models in this book, some of whom I've been very close to. I am the closest of all to my wife, who is in and of herself a change agent and has committed to impacting the realities of homelessness -- and making sure I get out of the house every day to do what I have to do. So she's inspired me and she's done great stuff. So I think I'll stay with that answer.  CNN: In Robert Redford's essay on freedom of speech, he encourages the use of humor when speaking out about a cause someone feels passionate about. Has humor helped you?  Cole: I think it does. I agree with Mr. Redford, and he's been a model of mine....  And I think we also have these walls around us, and when people disagree, we're inclined not to listen, but to a degree you can break through that wall often with humor. Jon Stewart has shown us how to do that, as have some other people who are in the art of doing it well.  CNN: What's your biggest hope for President-elect Barack Obama's presidency?  Cole: He has already surpassed my greatest hopes. I think he's created a sense of spirit and energy and opportunity in this country that we've never seen. And I think it has transformed, in a sense, who we are as a nation globally within 24 hours. We saw that happen.  CNN: How does a successful fashion designer, who also has a big conscience, feel in a weak economy?  Cole: I think it's an extraordinary opportunity. There are only so many things we can do that make us feel better. We pick up the newspapers and we want to cry every day. We turn on the news and we want to jump out the first window, jump in front of the first truck. And there's not a lot you can look forward to right now... but you can make yourself look better, and if you look better, you'll feel better, and it becomes self-fulfilling. I think fashion can do that to you.  You can do it with some older stuff and mix it with newer stuff, or you can just do new cool stuff by a new cool American designer (smiles). And starting from the ankles down, and then up.  CNN: Do you think that fashion gets a hard rap? [Are] people too quick to write it off as frivolous and underestimate its power?  Cole: I've struggled with that over the years. Is fashion relevant? Is it frivolous? Is it trivial? Because I give so much of my essence to it, as do everybody I work with.  I've come to two conclusions. One is that it's as relevant as anything, because most of the people you encounter in a given day don't get to know anything more about you than how you appear. You're making a very thoughtful statement... so I think fashion is important.  And then at the end of the day if someone you know is sick or someone you know can't afford the roof over their head or the food on the plate, then it becomes not so important.  So I think it's relevant, and for me it's been an extraordinary resource for me to do so much. And I love fashion. I think it makes us feel good.

{"article": " -- A prisoner killed in a Maryland county jail on Sunday was a victim of \"vigilante justice,\" Prince George's County Chief Executive Jack Johnson said.  Ronnie White, 19, died of strangulation and asphyxiation and had two broken bones in his neck, an autopsy showed.  An attorney for White's family said that because White was being held in solitary confinement at the Prince George's County Correctional Center, a corrections officer would have had to let whoever killed the prisoner into his cell.  His death came two days after his arrest in connection with the death of Prince George's County police Cpl. Richard Findley, who died Friday after being struck by a truck. Authorities believe that White was driving the truck, which was thought to be stolen. Police were attempting to flag it down when Findley was struck.  \"The killing of the officer is absolutely abhorrent, but also, Mr. White was presumed innocent and deserved his day in court just like any other citizens,\" Johnson said Monday night. \"We live in a constitutional democracy, and no one has the right to be judge and jury.\"  The FBI's Baltimore field office said it has opened a civil rights investigation into White's death. The Justice Department said Tuesday that federal prosecutors have been in contact with the state police and FBI as well as county prosecutors and the department's own Civil Rights Division.  \"In support of the Prince George's County State's Attorney's Office, which intends to retain lead responsibility for the criminal investigation, the U.S. Attorney's Office will provide guidance and legal advice to the officials looking into the death and seeking to develop evidence of criminal violations,\" the department said in a written statement.  Johnson said Monday that he had requested that the Maryland State Police conduct an independent investigation into White's death.  White family attorney Bobby Henry said there are only two ways someone could get into solitary confinement.  Watch why death has outraged family \u00bb  \"You either have to be buzzed in from the booth -- I believe it's called the control booth -- you need a key from there, or you have to get a key from one of two officers who were assigned to his unit on that day,\" Henry said.  The attorney said a \"yet to be identified person or persons took it upon themselves to be the judge, jury and executioner for Mr. White.\"  \"The family of Ronnie White is absolutely, unequivocally outraged, incensed and deeply saddened that the life of their loved one could be taken so cold[ly], so callously,\" Henry said Tuesday. \"Something is dreadfully wrong with the system.\"  County authorities have said that police are not suspects and that seven corrections officials and an unspecified number of supervisors were the only ones authorized to be in White's cell. None has been suspended or removed.  There were no surveillance cameras in the area of the jail where White was being held. White had not had the opportunity to meet with an attorney, Henry said.  A physical conducted when White was processed revealed no health issues, according to Johnson. He was checked regularly in his cell and appeared fine when corrections officers saw him at 10:15 a.m. Sunday. When officers brought him lunch 20 minutes later, he was unconscious and without a pulse, Johnson said.  Henry said White's family was not notified of his death until several hours after it occurred. They were told to go to Prince George's Hospital to identify the body, he said, but upon arrival were told the state medical examiner's office had taken custody of the body and it had been taken to Baltimore.  \"At this very moment, the family has not even seen the body of their loved one,\" Henry said. \"They have been denied the opportunity to start the grieving process which naturally must occur.\"  He said White's family is calling upon the Department of Justice, the FBI, the Maryland State Police and county officials \"to conduct a thorough and exhaustive investigation into all of these tragic events, beginning with the events of Friday, June 27, and continuing up until this time.\"  Prince George's County State's Attorney Glenn Ivey said a grand jury will be convened in the case. He said his office, which will handle any prosecutions that might result, is keeping an open mind. \"We'll follow the evidence wherever it leads,\" he said.  He added that he's \"never seen one like this. We've had deaths in custody, but this could be a unique one.\"  CNN's Jeanne Meserve and Mike Ahlers contributed to this report.", "Q": ["Q: Who opened civil rights investigation?

{"article": " -- The discovery of millions of extra ballots proves that President Robert Mugabe intends to rig next week's elections in his favor, Zimbabwe's main opposition party said Sunday.  President Robert Mugabe gestures during a pre-election rally in Harare on Saturday.  Tendai Biti, secretary general of the Movement for Democratic Change, said that leaked correspondence from the election commission showed it had asked the company that is printing paper ballots to make 9 million.  However, the African country has an electorate of 5.7 million registered voters, he said.  Also, 600,000 postal paper ballots were requested for soldiers and police officers, Biti said.  Postal ballots are usually requested for civil servants serving abroad, and the total number of soldiers and police in Zimbabwe add up to no more than 50,000, he said.  \"Remember, when they stole this election away from us the last time, they stole it with 350,000 votes,\" Biti said. \"Six hundred thousand is double insurance. They cannot win a free and fair election in this country.\"  The elections are slated for Saturday.  Mugabe survived a hotly contested presidential challenge from MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai in 2002 amid widespread accusations of vote rigging.  The president's other challenger this time is former Finance Minister Simba Makoni, who recently announced his bid to unseat Mugabe and was promptly booted out of the ruling party.  Last week, New York-based Human Rights Watch raised doubts about the elections, saying it was likely to be \"deeply flawed.\"  \"As the elections near, all indications are that once again the people of Zimbabwe will not be able to freely exercise their civil and political rights and vote for the candidates of their choice,\" the nongovernmental organization said in a 48-page report.  The elections are expected to provide Mugabe with the toughest challenge yet in his nearly 28 years of rule.  The report said the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission was partisan toward the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front and had neither the expertise nor the resources to run the elections properly.  Watch Mugabe threaten to expel companies under British rule. \u00bb  That report brought derision from a Zimbabwean official.  \"What qualifies them to do what they're doing -- policing the world and Africa in particular?\" asked Wilbert Gwashavanhu, political consul at Zimbabwe's embassy in Washington.  \"Why don't they go to America and oversee how America holds its own elections?\" he said. \"Come on, give me a break! You can't judge the elections before they are held.\"  No matter the final outcome of the election, the international community may never find out whether the vote proved to be free and fair. Independent news organizations are banned from Zimbabwe, and there are no credible monitors in place.  Since 1980, the 84-year-old Mugabe has been the country's only ruler. But his odds of winning this time may be handicapped by Zimbabwe's dire economic situation.  The rate of inflation reported in January was 100,000 percent, and food and fuel are in short supply, the Human Rights Watch document said. With more than three in four Zimbabweans unemployed, few could afford such food and fuel anyway.  The country's downward economic spiral began in 2000, when Mugabe sanctioned the violent seizure of commercial farms, turning some of the land over to insiders and cronies.  For his part, Mugabe remains defiant, blaming his country's economic woes on the West. E-mail to a friend  CNN's Saeed Ahmed contributed to this report.", "Q": ["Q: How old is Robert Mugabe?

{"article": "WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- A man who was raised at Camp Lejeune told lawmakers Thursday that he blames contaminated water at the U.S. Marines training base for his breast cancer.  Government records show decades of contaminated water at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina.  Michael Partain, who was diagnosed two years ago at the age of 39, told the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs that his parents were stationed at the base in North Carolina when he was born.  At least 40 former U.S. Marines or sons of Marines who lived at Camp Lejeune have been diagnosed with the cancer that strikes fewer than 2,000 men a year, compared with about 200,000 women.  The committee hearing was focused on exposure by military personnel to hazardous materials in the United States, Japan and Iraq, including toxic smoke from burn pits in Iraq and contaminated water.  Partain said that during his mother's pregnancy, the family was exposed to high levels of tetrachloroethylene, trichloroethylene, dichloroethylene, benzene and vinyl chloride in the tap water at the military base.  \"I am one of about 40 men who share this unique commonality of male breast cancer and exposure to contaminated tap water [at] Camp Lejeune,\" he told the committee.  The Marines with breast cancer served or lived at Camp Lejeune between the 1960s and 1980s. Government records show that the camp's water was contaminated for three decades.  Although the Marine Corps contends that two independent studies have found no link between water contamination and later illnesses, the men facing a debilitating and possibly lethal disease don't believe it.  Partain said his illness has been been a \"traumatic, emotional and physical\" ordeal for his family.  Two North Carolina senators -- Richard Burr, the ranking Republican on the committee, and Kay Hagan, a Democrat who is not a panel member -- are pushing legislation that would require the Department of Veterans Affairs to cover the medical costs of Marines and their families who were exposed to the contaminated water.  The provision, which has passed the Senate, would amend the Defense Appropriations Bill to prohibit the Navy from \"disposing of water-contamination claims before critical scientific studies can be completed.\"  According to Hagan, the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, which is part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is conducting human health and water modeling studies to determine whether the toxic water contributed to health problems at the base.  Some of the water was contaminated with toxins at concentrations up to 280 times what is currently considered safe by the Environmental Protection Agency, Hagan said. The bill covers the period between 1957 and 1987.  \"I think it should be our mission to give these families complete answers,\" she said. \"They can't get closure until the remaining CDC studies, which are in progress, are complete.\"  Sen. Roland Burris, D-Illinois, added, \"I am deeply concerned about possible environmental hazards in places where we are fighting two wars.\"  He and other senators agreed that current military personnel and veterans should not have to battle red tape to get health care and benefits.  Russell Powell, a medic with the 1092nd West Virginia Army National Guard, said that from April 2003 to June 2004, the unit was assigned to the Qarmat Ali water treatment plant in Basra, Iraq, to provide security for contractors with KBR, an engineering and construction company hired by the Defense Department to provide services in Iraq.  When the platoon reached the plant, they found it in disarray and coated with orange-colored dust, he testified. Large bags of the dust had been ripped open, and frequent dust storms blew through the facility, he said.  At no time were the security guards offered protective clothing, masks or respirators, Powell said.  After a few weeks, several soldiers began getting lesions on their hands, arms, faces and nostrils.  \"As a medic, I felt very concerned for the safety and health of persons exposed. I questioned one of the KBR workers, and he told me that his supervisors told him not to worry about it, that we were allergic to sand and dust,\" according to Powell.  When he went to a military doctor with his symptoms, the physician prescribed Motrin and Tylenol. Soon after, Powell began coughing up blood and was hospitalized. His face and lips were burned, and he could barely swallow, he said.  Powell left Iraq in April 2004, still suffering symptoms, he said. Doctors didn't know what it was. This year, he said, he received a letter from the West Virginia National Guard that said he and others may have been exposed to sodium dichromate. The medic said he's aware that research is being done.  Sodium dichromate is a poisonous red-orange crystalline compound.  Another witness, Stacy Pennington, cried in the hearing room as she described the agony her brother suffered before he died. Army Staff Sgt. Steven Ochs was 27 when he was deployed to Iraq in 2003, she said.  He was assigned at one point to Balad Air Base in northern Iraq, where there was a large burn pit: a junk pit where plastics, food, medical waste and, Pennington said, possibly even body parts were burned. The toxic smoke wafted over the area.  Dr. Bill Halperin, who heads a subcommittee of the Defense Health Board, an advisory committee to the Secretary of Defense, said in a presentation last year that before three incinerators were installed, the burn pit received as much as 500,000 pounds of waste a day.  After Ochs returned from his third Iraq tour, he was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia, his sister said. He spent 10 months at Duke University Hospital, where doctors, she said, told him that his aggressive form of the disease was \"definitely chemically induced\" by exposures to toxic materials in Iraq and Afghanistan, where Ochs also had served.", "Q": ["Q: What are the ways the family was exposed to chemicals?

Forecasters warned of large accumulations of ice in places such as the north Georgia mountains, causing hazardous driving conditions. Ice and heavy wet snow on power lines could cause power outages.  \"The precipitation will briefly transition back to light snow or flurries Saturday before ending Saturday afternoon,\" the weather service said.  By Friday afternoon the storm was either in or on its way to parts of Virginia, West Virginia, the Carolinas, Tennessee, Kentucky and Arkansas.

{"article": "CHICAGO, Illinois (CNN) -- The woman who received the first-ever near-total face transplant in the United States told her doctor she has regained her self-confidence, said Dr. Maria Siemionow, head of plastic surgery research at the Cleveland Clinic and leader of the transplant team.  This illustration represents the transformation of a patient who underwent a near-total face transplant in December.  The patient, who prefers to be anonymous, is finally able to breathe through her nose, smell, eat solid foods and drink out of a cup, Siemionow told participants of the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Chicago over the weekend.  The complex surgery, a 22-hour procedure, took place in December at the Cleveland Clinic. The patient received her new face in one graft from a donor cadaver.  \"I believe this procedure is justified because you need a face to face the world,\" Siemionow said.  Watch an animation of the face transplant \u00bb  The patient had previously \"suffered severe facial trauma,\" the Cleveland Clinic said. She had no nose, right eye or upper jaw before the procedure, and could not smell or eat normally. People would call her names on the street, Siemionow said.  The surgery gave the patient a nose with nasal lining, as well as a palate. This, combined with the olfactory receptors in the brain, gave the patient the ability to smell, Siemionow said.  Social reincorporation is as important as the face transplant itself, Siemionow said. At this point, the patient doesn't want to face the \"common world,\" but she is facing her family, the surgeon said.  The patient said she is happy because when she puts her hands on her face, she feels a nose, Siemionow said. She can also taste a hamburger and pizza, and drink coffee from a cup, the \"things we take for granted every day,\" Siemionow said.  The patient also received lower eyelids, upper lip, skin, muscles, bone, hard palate, arteries, veins and nerves.  As for the aesthetics of the new face, Siemionow suggested that restoring function was more important. \"At this point, no one is really looking at beautification,\" she said.  Siemionow, who has been working on face transplant research for 20 years, received approval from the Institutional Review Board in 2004 to conduct a full facial transplant.  Only patients who had already exhausted all possible options for conventional repair were considered for the transplant, Siemionow said.  Currently, cancer patients are not candidates for face transplants because  transplant recipients must take immunosuppression drugs for life so that the body does not reject the donated tissue, Siemionow said. In the future, however, lifelong immunosuppression may not be required, she said.  While burn damage is normally patched with pieces of excess skin from a person's own body, this does not work if the whole face needs to be covered -- the skin of the entire back is less than half of what would be needed to cover the full face and scalp, Siemionow said.  Previously, three facial transplants had been completed -- two in France and one in China. The Chinese recipient, Li Guoxing, died in July of unknown causes, Guo Shuzhong, a doctor involved in the case, confirmed to CNN.  One of the French face transplant recipients was a man who had a genetic disorder that created large tumors on his face. The other French patient had been bitten by a dog. The Chinese patient had been attacked by a bear.  European news media recently reported that a surgeon in Spain received approval for another face transplant, which would be the fifth in the world.  Researchers are also making headway into treatments for disorders that give rise to facial abnormalities, experts say. They are identifying genes that become mutated and cause the skull and facial features to become distorted.  \"We're moving into the arena where we can do medical treatment,\" Dr. Ethylin Jabs, professor of developmental and regenerative biology at Mount Sinai Medical School, said at the conference.  One example is Treacher Collins syndrome, a condition found in one in every 50,000 births, which affects the development of bones and other tissues in the face. Scientists have determined that the gene TCOF1 is involved in the disorder, and research is ongoing into the precise function of this protein.  By looking at the genetic underpinnings of disorders that lead to facial deformities, scientists can also understand what accounts for the normal differences in face and skull types.  \"These are going to be some of the genes that cause some of that variation,\" Jabs said.", "Q": ["Q: what can do recipient?

{"article": "ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistani authorities have launched a massive crackdown on terror groups that they say were planning numerous suicide attacks, including in the country's largest city of Karachi.  Pakistan security officials show seized weapons and ammunition in Karachi on Sunday after the arrest of seven alleged militants.  At least 13 suspects were arrested Sunday and Monday, including three people carrying suicide jackets and explosives inside a bus station, a police official said.  The three were seized early Monday after police raided a bus station in Sargodha, a city located about 120 miles (190 km) south of Islamabad in Pakistan's Punjab province.  The suspects were plotting to attack two Shiite mosques, police stations, and a Norwegian telecommunications company in Punjab, according to district police officer Usman Anwar. Three other suspects linked to the plot were arrested hours later in Sargodha, he said.  Those arrested early Monday included the Pakistani Taliban's chief in Punjab, according to Anwar.  The Taliban in Punjab have direct ties to Baitullah Mehsud, the former head of the Pakistan Taliban, and have been accused of sectarian murders in Punjab. Pakistan and U.S. officials contend Mehsud was killed in an August 5 drone attack in Waziristan at his father-in-law's house. The Taliban claim Mehsud is alive but ill.  Hakeemullah Mehsud has been selected as the new head of the Pakistani Taliban, a Taliban commander said Saturday.  Pakistani authorities also said they thwarted planned attacks in the southern port city of Karachi, Pakistan's largest city and the capital of Sindh province.  Seven members of a banned militant group with strong ties to al Qaeda and the Taliban were arrested Sunday along with suicide vests and a large quantity of ammunition, according to the city's police superintendent Mohammed Fayyaz Khan  The group, Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, was planning to conduct attacks in Karachi, according to Karachi Police Chief Waseem Ahmad.  Lashkar-e-Jhangvi is considered a terrorist group by the U.S. State Department, and was banned by then-Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf in 2001. It is described as Pakistan's \"most extreme and feared militant group\" by IHS Jane's, a provider of defense and security information. The banned Sunni militant group, which began in the 1990s, is a \"key ally\" of the Taliban and al Qaeda, according to Jane's.  \"However, many of its leaders and members have been killed or jailed in recent years and there is little evidence that it remains a coherent organization with centralized structures,\" Jane's said in an assessment released earlier this month.  Lashkar-e-Jhangvi is blamed for the attempted assassination of former Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in 1999, and the assassination of former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto in 2007.  The group also has also been linked to the March attack on the Sri Lankan cricket team in the Pakistani city of Lahore.  The recent arrests in Karachi and in Punjab are part of a broader crackdown on terror groups that have extended their reach outside Pakistan's volatile North West Frontier Province and adjacent tribal regions. That is where Pakistani security forces continue to battle a strong Taliban presence.  Taliban militants maintained strongholds within 100 miles of the capital, Islamabad, before Pakistani security forces pushed them back this year.  A month ago, Pakistani authorities unraveled a militant plot to target government buildings in Islamabad with suicide attackers, according to Interior Minister Rehmen Malik.  Three bombers were detained, and along with them suicide vests packed with complex explosives surrounded by ball bearings that would kill anyone within 50 to 100 meters.  \"They had the live jackets... they were staying in one house and they had hidden the suicide jackets not far from that (house) in the hills,\" Malik told CNN. \"Obviously they had a plan in Islamabad because Islamabad is the icon of the country.\"  He said they first planned to target parliament, then move on to other prominent government buildings in the capital city.  Hitting back at the government would seem to be a high priority for the newly appointed leader of the Pakistani Taliban. Said to be a brazen and young commander, Hakeemullah Mehsud has been linked to past attacks on NATO troops along the Afghan-Pakistan border who are battling a resurgent Taliban in neighboring Afghanistan.  Malik said the government is \"not interested\" in trying to establish a cease-fire with Taliban commanders during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which began this weekend. Past cease-fire agreements between the Pakistani government and tribal leaders negotiating on behalf of the Taliban have failed.  \"They are at the weakest moments and everybody knows -- even a child of Pakistan knows about it -- that their back is broken,\" Malik said. \"They are no more powerful... so we won't give them any time to get energized.\"  CNN's Samson Desta contributed to this report.", "Q": ["Q: What did the police chief say?

{"article": "GALVESTON, Texas (CNN)  -- Rescuers in Galveston, Texas, were going door-to-door Saturday to check on the estimated 20,000 people who failed to flee Hurricane Ike, which has slowed to tropical storm status.  Park benches are strewn about in downtown Houston Saturday during Hurricane Ike.  As of Saturday afternoon, the Galveston Fire Department had taken 27 people to a shelter in a high school on the coastal island, which was without electricity or water pressure.  No casualties had been discovered so far in the search and rescue efforts, which have been hampered by heavy flooding and scattered debris.  Galveston had ordered evacuation of the island, but Galveston City Manager Steve LeBlanc said about 40 percent of the city's 57,523 residents chose to stay.  LeBlanc said the island would be closed while authorities assess damages, including to the causeway, which was in \"bad shape\" because of debris and road damage.  \"The road buckled in a number of places,\" LeBlanc said. \"Even if we opened it up you couldn't get through.\"  LeBlanc said 17 buildings on the island had been destroyed by fires, potent winds and a strong storm surge.  \"We are in a recovery mode,\" Galveston Mayor Lyda Ann Thomas said in a press conference Saturday afternoon. \"This eye came right over us, stayed a while and went on, but it brought a lot of damage to our city.\"  Ike was downgraded Saturday to a tropical storm 11 hours after it crashed ashore as a Texas-sized hurricane that walloped southeast Texas and southwest Louisiana.  In its wake, Ike -- which smashed into the coast as a Category 2 hurricane -- left four people dead, millions without power and destroyed homes and businesses along the Gulf Coast with powerful winds, rain and floodwaters.  President Bush declared 29 Texas counties and parts of Louisianans major disaster areas, making federal funds available for recovery from the storm.  View images of places hit by Ike \u00bb  Many people, like D.J. Knight of Pearlman, Texas, decided to ride out the storm at home, despite voluntary and mandatory orders issued across the region.  \"The windows looked like they would explode,\" said Knight, a mother of two. \"It just wouldn't stop.\"  Now, without electricity and surrounded by flooded roads and wreckage, Knight wonders whether it was worth enduring a sleepless night as the storm shook her home, located about halfway between Galveston and Houston.  \"I didn't think it would be as bad as it was,\" she said. \"It was horrible.\"  Knight is one of thousands waiting for assistance as the state rolls out the largest search and rescue operation in Texas history.  See pictures of the storm's destruction \u00bb  Gov. Rick Perry dispatched a 1,000-strong search and rescue team, including state troopers, pilots and members of the National Guard. Lines of National Guard trucks and ambulances were deployed from San Antonio even as officials are trying to grasp the extent of damage and the number of Texans stranded by the storm.  However, flooding and debris have impeded rescue efforts in some areas, adding to the uncertainty about how many Texans actually survived the storm.  \"We're obviously concerned that there may be people we find who didn't get out and who are going to be in the rubble of what we uncover,\" said Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff. \"We hope for the best, but I do want to prepare people for the fact they we may have some fatalities.\"  Chertoff said 40,000 Texans were in 250 shelters, and that food and water would be distributed in about 20 coastal locations as rescue efforts continue.  In Galveston, which bore the brunt of the storm, floods filled the historic district with 7 feet of water at the storm's peak, said Galveston County official Margaret Bunch.  Watch how a spunky little girl braved the storm \u00bb  A foot of water flooded the city's main courthouse, where many people rode out the storm, she said.  Wanda Collins' garage filled with 5 feet of water, ruining everything inside, including a 2002 pickup truck, two Harley-Davidson motorcycles, a freezer and a washer and dryer.  \"I have never in my life seen water like this,\" the 30-year Galveston resident said.  Burle and Jamie Holmes also refused to leave their Galveston home despite a grim warning from the National Weather Service. Ike forced the couple and their dog, Trouble, into the attic, tossing their furniture like toys across the house.  \"We lost everything,\" Jamie Holmes.  Curfews are in place in Galveston until dawn Monday and in Houston's Harris County until 6 a.m. Sunday.  Houston Mayor Bill White said his city appears to have avoided loss of life, but streets blocked by floodwaters, downed trees and power lines hampered efforts to determine the full extent of the damage.  Authorities shut down downtown Houston, where the streets were littered with traffic lights and glass, for cleanup and damage assessment. The city's tallest skyscraper, the 75-story JP Morgan Chase Tower, was missing many of its windows.  See iReporter's images of destruction \u00bb  White advised residents to drink bottled or boiled tap water as a precaution after a power outage reduced water pressure, but he said nothing indicated that the water supply was contaminated.  Brennan's, a popular restaurant in downtown Houston for almost four decades, burned down Friday night as Ike battered the city.  North of Houston, a 10 -year-old boy died when a falling tree limb hit him in the head, the Montgomery County Sheriff's Office said. The boy's father was cutting down a dead tree in the family's yard in preparation for Ike's heavy winds early Saturday.  Nearly 2.6 million customers in Texas and Louisiana lack power because of Ike, the U.S. Energy Department said on Saturday.  In Brazoria County, emergency management officials said the main power line for the Texas/New Mexico grid was down. CenterPoint Energy said 90 percent of its customers were without electricity and it could take a month or more to get power restored to all of them.  iReporter Jackie Hensler of Houston said her apartment building's power was restored quickly on Saturday morning after a stormy night.  \"There are lots of trees down; they've been uprooted or snapped,\" she said after venturing outside. \"There's lots of debris in the streets, like boards and plywood from homes.\"  Watch how the roof peeled off a building \u00bb  Hurricane Ike proved to be a huge storm system, 900 miles across at its largest. It remained a hurricane hours after crashing ashore over Galveston at 2:10 a.m.  Its maximum sustained winds were near 80 mph, with higher gusts. It was expected to continue to weaken and move into western Arkansas by Saturday night.  Track the storm \u00bb  The storm surge, however, was smaller than forecast. The greatest surge, of 15 feet, happened at Sabine Pass, near the Texas-Louisiana line. Authorities had predicted surges of 20 to 25 feet.  Authorities in Orange County, Texas, on the Louisiana line, were using large dump trucks Saturday to rescue residents trapped on their roofs by massive flooding, a county judge told CNN.  The city of Orange and the town of Bridge City were flooded, Beaumont emergency official Brad Peneffon said.  Watch the storm surge in Beaumont \u00bb  Rescuers fanned out in boats Saturday in Cameron Parish, Louisiana, after the storm surge flooded 1,800 homes.  Gas prices soared across the country amid fears the storm would disrupt fuel supplies. Ike hit a region that is home to about 25 percent of the United States' oil refining capacity, and the storm's progress across the Gulf of Mexico shut down crude oil collection from Gulf oil fields.  The U.S. Department of Energy said 14 refineries were closed by the storm, along with two Texas strategic petroleum reserve sites.  In Knoxville, Tennessee, Sean Kennedy expressed dismay at the difference a day made to gas prices. iReport.com: Evacuees, San Antonio mayor talk about Ike  \"I filled up my tank yesterday morning on the way to work for $3.59 a gallon,\" he said. \"This morning, gas prices at the same station were $5 a gallon for regular and $5.25 for premium.\"  The Coast Guard said early Saturday that 22 people aboard a freighter that was adrift in the Gulf of Mexico were safe after the storm.  Some good news came out of the region Saturday. About 175 miles west of Houston, a storm evacuee delivered a baby in the ladies' bathroom at a shelter in New Braunfels.  \"The credit goes to the mother,\" said Dr. Mark Burns, who helped deliver the baby. \"She did a beautiful job with her delivery.\"  CNN's Jeanne Meserve, Rusty Dornin, Sean Callebs, Rob Marciano, Gary Tuchman, Arthur Brice, Deb Krajnak and Elise Miller contributed to this report.", "Q": ["Q: How many were affected by outages?

{"article": "Dangjin, South Korea (CNN) -- Steelmakers are known to be one of the worst polluters in manufacturing, but South Korea's newest plant claims it is designed to go green.  Hyundai Steel's Dangjin plant, which sits an hour and a half south of Seoul on the west coast, is the youngest steel plant in the world and has adopted new technologies to ensure it stand out from others.  By simply enclosing storage and transport routes for raw material, they are able to prevent dust particles from entering the surrounding areas.  The facility, which includes 35 kilometers (21 miles) of conveyor belts fully enclosed and state-of-the-art storage domes, cost Hyundai Steel roughly $5.5 billion to build. The two blast furnaces produce eight million tons of steel a year.  It is no small investment, but the steelmaker believes it will earn its way back in no time.  \"With the encapsulated storage system, we minimize loss of raw material so that may be $20 million a year (that we are saving),\" said Hyundai Steel's senior executive vice president Cho Won-suk.  Other steelmakers lose roughly 0.5% in raw materials annually by keeping them in the open, subjecting the material to rain and wind, according to Hyundai.  The idea is simple but conventional players elsewhere see it as a large investment that would require a new layout for the steel plant.  Hyundai's Dangjin plant, which blew in its blast furnace at the beginning of last year, was designed to accommodate the green system from the beginning.  Dangjin also boasts its recycling byproducts emitted during the process of burning and melting raw materials. The company says it recycles 100% of its byproducts which supplies 80% of the operation energy at the plant.  \"The byproduct gas contains energy and has some value. For example, it contains carbon monoxide, hydrogen and methane, so the byproduct gas can be utilized for heating up furnaces in the plant,\" vice president Cho said.  To make sure Hyundai is meeting its standards as a green steelmaker, it monitors its emission output around the clock which is not only reported to the government but is also open to the public.  The steelmaker keeps its pollution levels below half of the government's regulations, according to Hyundai's technical research center manager, Park Eung-yeul.  Its tight relationship with its sister companies, Hyundai Motor and Hyundai Construction, is also enhancing its efforts to become more green.  Not only does Hyundai Steel supply car parts to Hyundai Motor, the old cars at the end of their cycle come back to the steelmaker as scrap metal to be melted down and used once again. The rougher steel produced from scrap metal can then be used at construction sites.  Despite these efforts, tackling CO2 emissions remains an ongoing challenge.  But the company's dedicated task force team continue the drive towards producing environmentally-friendly energy and removing the obstacles in the way of even cleaner steel production.", "Q": ["Q: What is the cost of the conveyor belts?

{"article": "BUZZARDS BAY, Massachusetts (CNN)  -- A crew member aboard a freighter seized by pirates off east  Africa said Wednesday that the crew had captured one of four pirates who hijacked their vessel, but they released him in a failed hostage trade.  Shane Murphy is one of the crew members on board the U.S. ship that was hijacked off Somalia's coast.  The crew of the U.S.-flagged Maersk Alabama had hoped their release of the pirate would lead the pirates to release Capt. Richard Phillips, but it did not, crew member Ken Quinn told CNN in a satellite telephone call.  Instead, the four pirates -- who had scuttled their boat when they boarded the ship armed with AK-47s -- took Phillips with them aboard the ship's 28-foot lifeboat, Quinn said.  The crew had earlier overpowered the pirates and forced them off the ship, according to messages from first officer Shane Murphy.  Murphy relayed the information in quick phone calls to his wife and father in his home state of Massachusetts -- where his father, Joe Murphy, is a maritime instructor, and his son once lectured about dealing with hostage situations.  Watch Shane Murphy's wife recall the conversation \u00bb  Joe Murphy, who teaches at the Massachusetts Maritime Academy, said the crew sent a distress signal to which the U.S. Navy responded immediately from almost 200 miles away.  The ship had eluded the pirates for more than three hours off the coast of Somalia before being boarded, Joe Murphy said his son reported.  After hiding from their attackers, then leading them to believe they were more in command of the situation than they really were, the crew jumped the pirates, capturing one of them, the elder Murphy said his son told him.  \"It was by sheer force,\" he said. \"They have no weapons -- it must have been, obviously, that they overpowered them.\"  He said three other pirates \"had gone into the water.\"  Pentagon officials confirmed that four hijackers had boarded the Maersk Alabama Wednesday morning, and that one had been in custody.  Joe Murphy said his son was in contact with the pirates Wednesday evening, helping negotiate for the release of the captain.  He said he can only shake his head at the timing of the attack.  Two weeks ago, Shane Murphy visited his father's class to lecture the students on situations like the one he now faces.  \"This is a classic example of Murphy's law,\" Joe Murphy said. \"I teach the course, my son goes to sea and he gets captured.\"  He said that, despite his concerns, he has faith that his son's experience and knowledge will help wrap up the tense situation.  \"Hopefully, it's all going to work out,\" he said. \"I think this is going to end as a very positive story.\"  CNN's Jason Carroll and Tom Watkins contributed to this report.", "Q": ["Q: Where did the 4 hijackers board the Maersk Alabama?

{"article": "LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- The memorial service for singer Michael Jackson cost the city of Los Angeles $1.4 million, the mayor's office said Wednesday.  A donation page on the City of Los Angeles' Web site has crashed several times since its launch yesterday.  Costs included putting extra police on the streets, trash pickup, sanitation, traffic control and more for the Tuesday event, spokeswoman Sarah Hamilton said.  Three thousand police officers -- almost one-third of the Los Angeles police force -- were on hand to ensure the Jackson events proceeded smoothly, Los Angeles Assistant Police Chief Jim McDonnell, said Tuesday.  The city, which is $530 million in debt, set up a Web page asking Jackson fans to donate money to help with the expenses.  On Tuesday morning, hundreds of donors contributed more than $17,000 through the Web site. But then, the high volume of traffic caused it to crash frequently and for long periods of time, the mayor's office said.  The city, therefore, was unable to collect contributions for several hours on Tuesday.  The site also crashed for 12 hours, beginning at 8 p.m. Tuesday -- and again, periodically throughout Wednesday morning, the office said.  Los Angeles City Attorney Carmen Trutanich does not want taxpayers to pay a penny for the service, his spokesman said Wednesday.  \"The city attorney does not want something like this happening again, the city paying [the initial costs] for a private event,\" spokesman John Franklin said.  \"That's especially in a cash-strapped city, where people have been furloughed or even lost jobs.\"  During the Los Angeles Lakers championship parade this year, nearly 2,000 police were called in, at a cost of $2 million.

{"article": "ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- After his weekend arrest on gun charges, rapper T.I. will remain in custody until a bond hearing Friday, a federal magistrate said Monday.  T.I., whose real name is Clifford Harris, was arrested without incident in midtown Atlanta.  The entertainer, whose real name is Clifford Harris, was arrested Saturday just hours before he was scheduled to perform at the BET Hip Hop Awards.  The small court room of Magistrate Judge Alan Baverman was packed with family, supporters and media, but even more people, including the rapper's mother, were turned away because of the overcrowding.  Harris, 27, was arrested in a federal sting after his bodyguard-turned-informant delivered three machine guns and two silencers to the hip-hop star, according to a Justice Department statement.  Watch a search of the rapper's home \u00bb  He was held in federal custody over the weekend.  Authorities said that Harris provided the bodyguard $12,000 to buy the weapons, which Harris is not allowed to own because he is a convicted felon.  Court documents said Harris was convicted on felony drug charges in 1998, and a federal affidavit said he has been arrested on gun charges in the past.  However, one of his attorneys, Dwight Thomas, said he was not aware Harris was a convicted felon and that \"a number of people\" live in Harris' suburban Atlanta home. Thomas added there were \"two sides to every story -- sometimes three\" and he was confident the legal system would work in Harris' favor.  The entertainer was taken into custody about 2:30 p.m. Saturday in Atlanta, where the BET award show was taped.  Harris, the show's top nominee, was up for nine awards, including CD of the year and lyricist of the year. He also was scheduled to perform, along with fellow rap stars Common, Nelly and Kanye West. Harris won two awards.  The show went on without the self-proclaimed \"King of the South,\" whose car and home in the Atlanta suburb of College Park were searched after his arrest.  Authorities said they found three more firearms in the car in which Harris drove to pick up the machine guns and silencers, \"including one loaded gun tucked between the driver's seat where Harris had been sitting and the center console.\"  At his home, authorities found six other guns, five of them loaded, in his bedroom closet.  \"Machine guns pose a serious danger to the community, which is why they are so carefully regulated,\" said David Nahmias, U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Georgia.  \"The last place machine guns should be is in the hands of a convicted felon, who cannot legally possess any kind of firearm. This convicted felon allegedly was trying to add several machine guns to an already large and entirely illegal arsenal of guns.\"  The sting came after Harris' bodyguard was arrested purchasing the machine guns and silencers from an undercover Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives agent Wednesday, according to the Justice Department statement.  The bodyguard then agreed to cooperate with the ATF, the statement said.  The guns were not registered on the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record as required by law. The bodyguard -- who has worked for Harris since July -- told authorities he had bought about nine guns for the rap star in the past, the statement said.  On Wednesday, authorities said, Harris arranged for the bodyguard to pick up $12,000 in cash from a bank to buy the guns. After his arrest, the bodyguard made phone calls to Harris, which authorities recorded, the statement said.  Harris was supposed to meet the bodyguard in a shopping center parking lot in midtown Atlanta to pick up the guns. Authorities arrested Harris there without incident, the Justice Department statement said.  Court documents in the case show Harris was convicted on felony drug charges in Cobb County, Georgia, in 1998 and sentenced to seven years' probation.  \"Harris has additional arrests and at least one probation violation for unlawfully possessing firearms,\" according to an affidavit.  Harris' music is built around the drug culture and is known as \"trap musik,\" the name of Harris' second album. A \"trap\" is Southern slang for a drug house.  Harris soon will appear in the movie \"American Gangster,\" starring Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe. The film is set to open November 2.

{"article": "BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Mothers cradle children in their arms. Fathers smile softly at the helpless bodies they hold. Other parents are bent over from the weight of their teenage kids whose legs fall limp, almost touching the ground. In the absence of basic medical equipment, these parents do this every day.  An  Iraqi boy gives a thumbs up after receiving his wheelchair. Brad Blauser, center, created the program.  Khaled is a father of three. On this day, his young daughter, Mariam, is getting fitted for her new wheelchair. Her arms and legs are painfully thin, little more than skin and bone. She's 7 years old, but looks barely half that. She and both her siblings, a sister and brother, suffer from varying degrees of polio. None of them can walk.  Asked how he and his family cope, Khaled chokes up, fighting back tears.  \"I am sick of life -- what can I say to you?\" he says after a long pause.  One man, Brad Blauser, has vowed to try to make life a little easier for these families by organizing the distribution of wheelchairs, donated and paid for by his charity, Wheelchairs for Iraqi Kids. He first came to Iraq in 2004 as a civilian contractor. Struck by the abject chaos surrounding him and seeing helpless children scooting along the ground, he pledged to find a way to help.  Watch dads, moms carry kids; tears flow when wheelchairs arrive \u00bb  His first step was to consult an Army medic to find out what hospitals really needed. \"He surprised me with his answer about pediatric wheelchairs. We've got so many children out in the city that the ones who can get around are following their friends by dragging themselves around on the ground, which is heartbreaking to see,\" he says.  \"I was surprised. It took me aback.\"  Enlisting the help of generous supporters and an Iraqi humanitarian group Wheelchairs for Iraqi Kids was born in August of 2005. Thirty days later its first 31 chairs were delivered. To date more than 250 Iraqi families have received the wheelchairs.  Blauser has partnered with a nonprofit group called Reach Out and Care Wheels, which sells him the chairs at a manufacturing price of about $300.  The chairs are made by prisoners at the South Dakota State Penitentiary and ultimately delivered in Iraq by the U.S. military.  \"Getting these prisoners involved, it just means the world to them,\" said Andrew Babcock, the executive director of Reach Out and Care Wheels. \"Even the prisoners, I've been there and visited, and they're so excited. They come up with different design ideas and ways to make things better for the kids. They want to know where the chairs are going and what kids we're helping.\"  Blauser said it's unbelievable to be there when the chairs are delivered.  \"The most affecting thing about this whole wheelchairs for children is when the parents realize the gift that is being given to their children and they reach out to hug you.\" he said. \"The tears are running from their eyes and they say, 'We never thought that you could do this.' \"  Blauser is helped on the Iraqi missions by the civil affairs division of the U.S. military, which helps organize the safe transport of the families to the distribution point and adjustment of the wheelchairs to fit each child.  He said it gives \"the troops something when they go home, something good to remember where they know they have contributed, they know they have done a good thing.\"  Army Sgt. 1st Class Jason Jurack agrees. \"It brings a smile to your face. It really gives a different image to the Army as a whole -- helping people out, putting a smile on local nationals' faces, little kids that need our help.\"  It's a sentiment that is echoed by Samira Al-Ali, the head of the Iraqi group that finds the children in need. On this day, she tells the soldiers she hopes that this humanitarian act will give them a different image of Iraq, not one of a gun and war, she says. Her words are simple but effective.  \"I wish the world would see with their own eyes the children of Iraq and help the children of Iraq, because the children of Iraq have been deprived of everything,\" she said. \"Even a normal child has been deprived of their childhood; a disabled child and their family is dealing with so much more.\"  The children also show gratitude, even those who can scarcely move. Blauser remembers one boy's father who dressed him in a three-piece suit, with the trousers hanging off his motionless legs.  \"He couldn't move his legs or his arms. But when we sat him in his chair, he gave us the thumbs up.\"  Iraqi parents will go to any lengths to improve the quality of their children's lives. Blauser points to one of his favorite photographs, of a father carrying his son in his arms, an endless desert road behind him. He had carried his son more than 6 miles to get a wheelchair.  \"In August 2006 we had a distribution in northern Iraq,\" Blauser remembered. \"We watched him [the father] come forward, and people rushed to take the boy from his arms. And he said, 'No, I've been carrying this child all my life. I can carry him the last 100 yards to receive his wheelchair.' \" E-mail to a friend  CNN's Wayne Drash contributed to this report from Atlanta, Georgia.", "Q": ["Q: Who makes wheelchairs?

{"article": "Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- The central business district of Bangkok dodged severe flooding Saturday afternoon, but surrounding areas of the bustling capital faced further inundation at the next high tide.  A dreaded tide on Saturday spurred residents' fears that it would overwhelm defenses along the Chao Phraya River and its many canals.  Bangkok's outer suburbs were already submerged, but the central city has been largely spared the misery Thailand has been suffering for months in the nation's worst flooding since 1942.  In the east and the north of the city, water was at waist-level in some neighborhoods.  But the city -- which sits barely above sea level -- still faces two converging threats.  Massive runoff was flowing south to the sea through Bangkok, as high tides pushed the water in the opposite direction.  \"The challenge is to manage the huge runoff from the north passing via the city on its way to the Gulf of Thailand,\" a Red Cross bulletin said.  Bangkok's Chinatown area -- normally hopping with activity on a Saturday afternoon -- was largely desolate, with few passers-by wading in knee-deep water.  Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra ordered work crews Friday to cut channels in roadways to allow faster drainage, according to the MCOT news agency. But the plan was rejected late in the day in favor of dredging canals and using pumps, the Bangkok Post reported.  Health concerns were rising with the water.  Bangkok residents plodded through murky waters without knowing what lurked within, the risk of infection and communicable disease worrying health officials. The government sent out crocodile hunters after reports of crocodiles and snakes in the filthy floodwater.  \"We were hearing disturbing reports of dangerous animals such as snakes and crocodiles appearing in the floodwaters, and every day we see children playing in the water, bathing or wading through it trying to make their way to dry ground,\" said Annie Bodmer-Roy, spokeswoman for the humanitarian agency Save the Children.  As floodwater entered homes, some Bangkok residents still in the city made plans to leave.  Thanyarat Hemkittiwat said she was going to stay with relatives outside the city.  \"Some families in southern Bangkok had their house flooded,\" said the 31-year-old worker at a furniture export company, which was shut after it also was flooded. \"The water level is 2 meters (six feet) high and smells very bad,\" she said.  The Bangkok Post reported that government buses had evacuated a number of elderly residents from the northern and eastern suburbs, and would pick up residents of the capital on Saturday and take them out of Bangkok. As of Saturday, an estimated 1 million of the city's 12 million residents had left.  Another Bangkok resident said she was worried about abandoning her house, which has been flooded for five days, and would not leave.  Panic buying has led to a shortage of food and bottled water in the capital, residents said.  And the worst might not yet be over.  Another high tide -- expected to reach about 4 meters (13 feet) high -- is forecast for Sunday morning.  Officials urged tourists to steer clear of Bangkok, while noting that many of the other tourist spots, such as Phuket, remained dry and open for business.  Thailand's Ministry of Public Health had transferred 280 of the capital's 520 patients in severe condition to 22 hospitals upcountry, the MCOT news agency reported.  The remaining 240 patients will be taken to hospitals in other provinces by Sunday, it said, citing Permanent-Secretary for Health Paichit Varachit.  Health Minister Witthaya Buranasiri said that, after months of flooding, 107,101 Thais have been diagnosed with stress, 6,214 with depression and 878 at risk of suicide. In all, 1,356 people were under observation by health officials, the minister said, according to MCOT.  The U.S. State Department issued a travel alert on Thursday, recommending against all but essential travel to affected areas. It noted that most tourist destinations, such as Phuket and Chiang Mai, were unaffected.  U.S. Ambassador Kristie Kenny said the crisis was slow-moving and it was hard to know what would be hit next.  The floods, caused by monsoon rains that saturated rivers, have killed 373 people nationwide and affected more than 9.5 million people,  Are you there? Share photos, video but stay safe  The government has called the flooding the worst to afflict the nation in half a century and said it might take more than a month before the waters recede from some areas.  The government has set up more than 1,700 shelters nationwide, and more than 113,000 people have taken refuge in them.  Overall damage from the floods could exceed $6 billion, the Thai Finance Ministry said.

{"article": " -- Iran could see widespread protests this weekend, as a day of mourning for the most prominent cleric to oppose the regime coincides with the major Shiite holy day of Ashura.  Iran -- whose regime exists as an explicitly Shiite Muslim leadership -- may find it politically and culturally difficult to put a lid on the marking of Ashura this year.  It falls on Sunday -- which happens to be a week to the day since the death of Grand Ayatollah Hussein Ali Montazeri, a key figure in the 1979 Iranian revolution. Montazeri, who went on to become one of the government's most vocal critics, died December 20.  The seventh day after a death is a traditional time for mourning in Islam, giving Iran's opposition two reasons to demonstrate on Sunday, both with impeccable religious justification.  But what exactly is Ashura and why does it draw such passionate crowds, some of whom beat themselves until they bleed?  The holy day commemorates the martyrdom of Imam Hussein, who died in 680 fighting to lead the religion based on the teachings of his grandfather, the Prophet Mohammed. The battle is one of the defining points in the split between the two main branches of Islam, the majority Sunnis and the minority Shiites.  Hussein was badly outnumbered when he was killed fighting Yazeed near the city of Karbala, in modern-day Iraq.  Shiites commemorate the death of Hussein each year, climaxing on Ashura -- the 10th day of the month of Muharram -- after a 40-day mourning period.  While Shiites are a minority among Muslims worldwide, they are the majority in Iraq and Iran, where the day sees tens or even hundreds of thousands of faithful out on the streets.  Some of the most dramatic scenes take place in Karbala itself, as Shiites congregate to do symbolic penance for failing to come to Hussein's aid in his uprising against Yazeed.  Believers chant, beat their breasts, cut themselves with daggers or swords and whip themselves in synchronized moves.  In Iraq under Saddam Hussein, the marking of Ashura was banned for 30 years. (The former dictator was a Sunni.) The first public Ashura demonstrations in Karbala after his fall, in 2004, came under attack by Sunni militants.", "Q": ["Q: in what year its revolution?

{"article": "(Oprah.com) -- If you  heard there was a weapon proven to prevent most crimes before they happen, would you run out and buy it? World-renowned security expert Gavin de Becker says this weapon exists, but you already have it. He calls it \"the gift of fear.\"  One chapter in Gavin's book \"The Gift of Fear\" has stuck with Oprah since she first read it.  The story of a woman named Kelly begins with a simple warning sign. A man offers to help carry her groceries into her apartment -- and instantly, Kelly doesn't like the sound of his voice. Kelly goes against her gut and lets him help her -- and in doing so, she lets a rapist into her home.  \"We get a signal prior to violence,\" Gavin says. \"There are preincident indicators. Things that happen before violence occurs.\"  Gavin says that unlike any other living creature, humans will sense danger yet still walk right into it.  \"You're in a hallway waiting for an elevator late at night. Elevator door opens, and there's a guy inside, and he makes you afraid. You don't know why, you don't know what it is. Some memory of this building -- whatever it may be. And many women will stand there and look at that guy and say, 'Oh, I don't want to think like that. I don't want to be the kind of person who lets the door close in his face. I've got to be nice. I don't want him to think I'm not nice.' And so human beings will get into a steel soundproof chamber with someone they're afraid of, and there's not another animal in nature that would even consider it.\"  For weeks, Nicole had a funny feeling that something odd was going on in her apartment. \"My gut started feeling like something just wasn't right,\" she says. \"I would come home, and there would be just weird lights on in my house -- lights that I didn't even remember turning on in the first place.\"  Then one day, Nicole noticed a UPS delivery box where it shouldn't be. \"I'm like, 'How did this brand of box get on my back balcony?'\" Nicole began to feel uneasy -- but continued to brush it off. \"I would just come home, you know, and almost feel nauseous,\" she says. \"I kept trying to justify it saying, 'Okay, it is in my head.'\"  Nicole's funny feeling eventually escalated into full-fledged panic attacks, which Gavin says were her intuition's way of telling her that something was wrong.  \"And intuition records everything. So when she started getting panics attacks, her intuition is saying, basically, 'You're not going to listen? Okay, I'll ramp it up. I'll give you panic attacks. You want sleepless nights? I'll give you sleepless nights.'\"  Nicole eventually did listen to her intuition, starting with a simple test. \"I dropped a tank top behind the door as I was leaving for work, thinking that when I come home that night, I'm going to peek my head around the corner. If [the tank top] had been pushed to the side, it would have been obvious that the door was opened.\" When Nicole got home, she says the tank top had moved.  Caught on camera  The next day, Nicole says she set up a hidden camera to try and find out what was going on in her apartment. Once she came home, Nicole says she plugged the camcorder into her laptop. \"And the first thing I see is this man's head peeking around the corner into my house,\" she says. \"What I felt at that point was just complete terror. I'm sitting there watching this video --this story unfold -- and this person comes in my house, is looking around, going through my things, looking through my laundry, holding up my lingerie.\"  As Nicole continues to watch in horror, the intruder undresses himself and puts her lingerie on. \"So this person is in my clothes, proceeds to start pleasuring himself -- just very, very graphic things happening right there in my house with my belongings. And he finishes up, takes off my clothes -- and puts them exactly back as I had left them -- puts his clothes back on, checks to make sure nobody's outside the door and leaves.\"  After watching the tape, Nicole says she ran around her apartment, screaming hysterically. She says she had never seen the man in the tape before. \"Initially, I took my cell phone, called my boyfriend at the time, screaming hysterically. All I could say was, 'He's in my house. He's in my house.' Even picking up the phone, dialing, was difficult.\"  Two weeks later, police found the man -- 39-year-old Shawn Rogers, a computer consultant with a young son and a wife at the time. Police were unable to charge Rogers with anything more than trespassing... until he came back to Nicole's apartment to steal her camera. Police were able to charge Rogers with burglary, and he was sentenced to eight years in prison.  Dangerous behavior  When Nicole found the UPS box on her balcony, Gavin says this was a warning sign. Gavin applauds Nicole for listening to her intuition and says that quieting her fear could have caused the situation to escalate. \"He's already into behavior of wanting to get caught,\" he says. \"You don't come back again and again and again and not want to get caught.\"  Gavin says like Nicole, the intruder's intuition was probably trying to tell him something too. \"Offenders as well can see what's happening in their lives. And talk about not listening to it -- he's in someone's apartment doing something sexual with their clothes on -- that's something to listen to.\"  Because the intruder had a job and a family, Gavin says his behavior was not only reckless, but dangerous as well.  \"When people do listen, they can stop what's almost fate,\" Gavin says. \"There's a great line that Carl Jung said. He said, 'What we do not make conscious emerges later as fate.' If he made it conscious, if he could talk to someone about it, if he could tell someone, he could get better also. But he didn't, and it does mean escalation. If she discovered him, that's dangerous. If he came in when she was there, that's dangerous.\"  Your feelings are warnings  Doris, who says she endured years of sexual abuse at the hands of her husband, appeared on \"The Oprah Show\" after leaving her husband. Unfortunately, her battle didn't end there -- two months after she left him, Doris's ex-husband abducted her at gunpoint and raped her.  After the show, Oprah spoke with Doris again to ask if her she had sensed any warning signs the night she was abducted. \"As I was coming home from work, it was just a very eerie, strange feeling as I drove up,\" Doris says. \"It was darker than normal in my driveway, and there was a trash can sitting where I normally park right in the middle.  \"I thought, 'Hmm, this is strange.' Because my mother lives with me, and she'll turn on the lights when it gets dark. It did give me a little eerie feeling -- the hairs on the back of your neck kind of stand up. But still, I didn't listen to my instincts.\"  Gavin says that \"eerie feeling\" is exactly what he wants women to pay attention to. \"We're trying to analyze the warning signs,\" he says. \"And what I really want to teach today and forever is the feeling is the warning sign. All the other stuff is our explanation for the feeling. Why it was this, why it was that. The feeling itself is the warning sign.\"  From \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\"  Subscribe to O, The Oprah Magazine for up to 75% off the newsstand price. That's like getting 18 issues FREE.

{"article": " -- France's reputation as rugby's Jekyll and Hyde team was reaffirmed on Saturday as Marc Lievremont's inconsistent side bounced back from two defeats to eliminate England and reach the World Cup semifinals.  Les Bleus avenged their 2007 semi defeat by the English on home soil with a 19-12 victory in Auckland, setting up a last-four clash with Wales -- who went through after beating Celtic neighbors Ireland 22-10.  With the other half of the drawing pitting hosts New Zealand against Argentina, and world champions South Africa versus Australia -- both games are on Sunday -- there could potentially be a repeat of the inaugural 1987 final when the All Blacks beat France.  Coach Lievremont will be replaced by Philippe Saint-Andre after the tournament, but he has the chance to help France to lift the Webb Ellis Cup for the first time.  His team lost to New Zealand and Tonga in the group stage, but roared to a 16-0 halftime lead at Eden Park as wing Vincent Clerc and fullback Maxime Medard crossed for tries, while Dimitri Yachvili kicked two penalties.  England, the 2003 champions, rallied with second-half tries to fullback Ben Foden and wing Mark Cueto but a drop-goal by Francois Trinh-Duc in between those scores kept France safely ahead.  \"You can't give a good team like France 16 points of a start. We had chances in the second half but they deserved to win,\" said England manager Martin Johnson, a World Cup winner as a player eight years ago.  France captain Thierry Dusautoir was glad to put the nightmare of the shock Tonga defeat behind him.  \"We didn't want to go out like this. We wanted to show how we can play rugby,\" he said.  \"I think we did it well. It was a great start for us and we are going to enjoy this victory. Now we need to keep it up and focus on the next game.\"  The French will take on Wales at Eden Park next Saturday after Warren Gatland's team handed Ireland a first defeat of the tournament to reach the semifinals for the first time since 1987.  The Group D runners-up scored three tries to one in Wellington as Ireland failed to capitalize on a wealth of first-half possession and crashed out at the last-eight stage for the fifth successive time.  Veteran winger Shane Williams put Wales ahead with a third-minute try that young flyhalf Rhys Priestland converted for a 10-3 lead at the break. Ronan O'Gara kicked Ireland's only points with a 24th-minute penalty before Leigh Halfpenny replied in kind just before the half hour.  Ireland leveled five minutes after the interval as O'Gara converted a try by wing Keith Earls, but Wales scrum-half Mike Phillips dotted down in the 51st minute and center Jonathan Davies made it safe on 64.  \"We spent a lot of time in that first half in their 22 and we only came up with three points in the half,\" Ireland captain Brian O'Driscoll said.  \"It hurts a bit when you're going in at halftime having the opportunities and knocking on the door, but not really getting any points out of the territory.  \"We needed to deliver a performance similar to the one against Australia or the one against Italy last week. We didn't do that today, we knocked on way too much ball.\"  Gatland backed his young team to go further in the tournament.  \"They have no baggage and there's no fear factor,\" Gatland said. \"We are in New Zealand and not in the bubble of Wales and listening to any of the negativity that is sometimes generated back home.  \"We've worked so hard in the last three, four months. We aren't ready to go home yet.\"", "Q": ["Q: Who suffered first defeat of the tournament in New Zealand? A:", "Q: Where did the tournament take place?

{"article": "Detroit (CNN) -- The judge in the federal trial of alleged \"underwear bomber\" Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab refused Tuesday to prevent the prosecution from calling the device he allegedly carried a \"bomb.\"  U.S. District Judge Nancy Edmunds also refused to exclude a photo of AbdulMutallab's burned genitals from the evidence.  Before the prosecution began its opening statement, defense standby counsel Anthony Chambers asked that the prosecutors not be allowed to use the words \"explosive device\" or \"bomb\" during the trial. It's up to the jury to decide whether the device AbdulMutallab was carrying was a bomb, Chambers argued.  \"I'm going to deny that motion,\" responded Edmunds. \"It makes no sense whatsoever.\"  As for the photo, the judge said it did not seem \"unusually prejudicial.\"  AbdulMutallab, accused of trying to detonate an explosive device in his underwear aboard a Christmas 2009 flight to Detroit, has said he will represent himself.  The prosecution delivered a 90-minute opening statement. The defense said it would reserve the right to give an opening statement at a later point in the trial in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan. At one point, AbdulMutallab joined the attorneys for a sidebar with the judge.  While at previous court appearances AbdulMutallab has had outbursts -- including yelling \"Osama's alive,\" a reference to Osama bin Laden, according to a court official -- he remained calm Tuesday. AbdulMutallab wore a traditional African gown, gray with gold-colored braiding.  AbdulMutallab was indicted on charges including attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction, conspiracy to commit an act of terrorism, and possession of a firearm or destructive device in furtherance of an act of violence.  He has pleaded not guilty to the charges.  He was a passenger on Northwest Airlines Flight 253 en route from the Netherlands to Detroit on Christmas Day 2009.  U.S. officials say the terror group al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula was behind the alleged bombing attempt.  Jonathan Tukel, chief of the National Security Unit for the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Eastern District of Michigan, laid out details of the flight in his opening statement.  Passengers were from 26 different countries, most of them American and Dutch, he said. \"Everyone had someplace to be. All but one.\" Pointing to AbdulMutallab, Tukel said, \"His sole reason for being on Flight 253 was to kill all of the passengers and himself. He thought he'd end up in heaven.\"  After taking numerous trips to the bathroom, AbdulMutallab went back to the bathroom about an hour before the plane was to land, \"to purify himself to die,\" Tukel said. AbdulMutallab did not eat or drink on the plane, a fast that was part of ritual purification, Tukel said.  A witness testified that AbdulMutallab was in the bathroom for about 15 to 20 minutes, which seemed long to the passenger, Tukel said.  When AbdulMutallab returned to his seat, he pulled a blanket over his head, \"pushed the plunger on the bomb and prepared to die,\" Tukel said.  Passengers heard a loud noise, which sounded like a firecracker, Tukel said. AbdulMutallab became enveloped in a fireball which then spread to the wall and carpeting of the plane, yet he remained in his seat \"expressionless, completely blank,\" Tukel said.  Four passengers helped subdue him and tried to put out the fire, Tukel said, and AbdulMutallab was escorted up to first class.  When a flight attendant asked him what he had in his pockets, he called it \"an explosive device,\" Tukel said.  Tukel added that AbdulMutallab was very verbal and spoke with many people, including some on the flight and officials once the flight landed.  The prosecution also called its first witness Tuesday, Michael Zantow, who was on the flight one row behind AbdulMutallab. Zantow, a 20-year veteran of the Army, was among those who tried to restrain the defendant.  Within a minute of the loud sound on the plane, a passenger said to AbdulMutallab, \"Hey man, your pants are on fire!\" Zantow testified. The passenger repeated himself two or three times, and AbdulMutallab did not respond, Zantow said.  The jury is made up of three white men and nine women -- six white, two African-American and one Southeast Asian.

{"article": " -- Attorneys for 16 Indiana National Guard soldiers on Wednesday sued the largest U.S. contractor in Iraq, alleging the company knowingly exposed the soldiers to a cancer-causing toxic chemical.  16 Indiana National Guardsmen have sued the Houston-based company Kellogg Brown and Root, known as KBR.  The lawsuit against Houston-based KBR, which seeks an unspecified amount, alleges that the soldiers were exposed to sodium dichromate, an inorganic compound containing a highly toxic form of chromium known as hexavalent chromium.  The soldiers say that they, along with other American civilian contractors, were exposed to the chemical at the Qarmat Ali water pumping plant in southern Iraq shortly after the U.S. invasion in 2003.  KBR was tasked with getting the plant up and running using civilian contractors. The National Guardsmen were assigned to protect the civilian workers.  The Guardsmen and civilian contractors who worked there have described walking on and sitting near the bright orange powder that was widely dispersed throughout the grounds of the water plant. The chemical was believed to have been left behind by forces loyal to Saddam Hussein.  Some of the Guardsmen already suffer from nasal tumors or respiratory system problems and other health problems, according to the lawsuit. One of the guardsmen may have died from the exposure, though the exact cause of his death earlier this year is still not clear.  The odorless sodium dichromate was used at the plant as an anti-corrosive, the lawsuit says. The chemical contained nearly pure hexavalent chromium, the toxic substance that poisoned homeowners in Hinkley, California, and was made famous by activist Erin Brockovich, according to the suit.  For the Guardsmen, KBR's \"knowing acts and omissions\" resulted in \"months and months of unprotected, unknowing, direct exposure to one of the most potent carcinogens and mutagenic substances known to man,\" the lawsuit alleges.  A spokeswoman for KBR said the company was still reviewing the lawsuit, but denied responsibility for creating unsafe conditions at the plant.  \"We are not providing comment on the suit at this time. The company does intend to vigorously defend itself,\" KBR spokeswoman Heather Browne said.  The Guardsmen say the company knew about the dangers of exposure to the chemical as far back as 2003, but did not act to protect the soldiers.  \"KBR managers knew full well long ago that this stuff was incredibly dangerous. But there was no information about it for years. And now these soldiers are facing some pretty serious health concerns. They're going to be stuck with this the rest of their lives,\" said Doyle.  \"The most frustrating thing is that these guys are finding out years later that they were exposed to something,\" said Mike Doyle, one of the Houston attorneys representing the Guardsmen.  KBR took issue with the allegation that the company knowingly exposed the soldiers or anyone else and did nothing to help.  \"KBR's commitment to the safety and security of all employees, the troops and those we serve is the company's top priority,\" the statement read.  \"KBR appropriately notified the Army Corps of Engineers upon discovery of the existence of the substance on the site and the Corps of Engineers concluded that KBR's efforts to remediate the situation were effective. Further, the company in no way condones any action that would compromise the safety of those we serve or employ.\"  Mark McManaway, a father and grandfather, was an Indiana National Guard sergeant at the water plant from May through September 2003, when the worst exposures are believed to have occurred. He is one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit.  \"The worst part is that the military has only just recently advised us that the stuff we were exposed to was much worse than they thought while we were out there,\" said McManaway. \"It's in our bodies, but we don't know how bad it is. Maybe within the next five years cancers could start showing up. You've got a ticking time bomb in you -- and when's it going to go off?\"  The U.S. military is not named as a defendant in the lawsuit.  The toxic chemical made famous by Brockovich in California was a diluted form of hexavalent chromium that caused serious illnesses after being ingested by homeowners through their water. The chemical the Guardsmen were exposed to in Iraq was a nearly  pure form of the chemical and could have been inhaled directly by anyone working at the plant.  The U.S. Senate held hearings in August on emerging concerns about the exposure to the toxic chemicals after reports of civilian contractors and their exposure to the chemicals at the water plant.  But officials of the National Guard -- and most of the Guardsmen who worked at the plant -- were not even aware of the possible dangers at the time of the hearing. Some heard about for the first time during the televised hearings. Only then did the National Guard begin efforts to find the men, some of whom had already been back in the United States for four years.  An estimated 275 American soldiers may have been exposed to the chemical at the water plant, over a period of months through mid- to late-2003.", "Q": ["Q: who was exposed to cancer-causing chemical at Iraq plant?

{"article": " -- Jeannie Longo-Ciprelli would be remembered as the greatest female cyclist of her generation even if she had never been an Olympic champion.  Longo-Ciprelli: Fourth time lucky in Atlanta in 1996.  For much of her career, the Olympic gold was the one honor to elude the French rider.  Misfortune, it seemed, was to be her fate every four years, regardless of how many world championships she won in between.  In 1984 the first women's Olympic road race coincided with Longo-Ciprelli's rise to dominance in the sport.  Well-placed going into the final lap, she appeared set to challenge in the sprint, only to be knocked off in a collision.  By 1988, Longo-Ciprelli was a three-time road race world champion, as well as a double winner of the women's Tour de France, and the clear favorite for gold in Seoul.  But a broken hip a month before the Games derailed her preparations. Although she recovered enough to ride the road race, she could manage just 21st place.  Tactical error More disappointment followed in Barcelona in 1992 as Longo-Ciprelli paid the price for a tactical error. With three kilometers to go, she raced away from the peloton and crossed the line in celebration.  But she had failed to realize that Kathy Watt, an unheralded Australian, had slipped away from the lead group apparently unnoticed with a lap to go, and finished 20 seconds further in front.  Four years later, in Atlanta, Longo-Ciprelli, finally cracked her Olympic jinx.  At 37, Longo-Ciprelli was no longer the dominant presence she had once been, but she still possessed the ability to raise her performance for the biggest races, as she had proven by winning her fourth road race world title in 1995.  Her preparations were typically unorthodox -- while her rivals were acclimatizing to the Atlanta heat, Longo-Ciprelli trained alone in the mountains of Colorado, arriving just two days before the race.  The race itself was run in a sudden downpour, which sent many riders crashing and skidding and had the rest struggling to stay on their bikes.  Unruffled, Longo-Ciprelli broke clear with two other riders and then launched her gold-winning solo attack 11 kilometers from the finish.  Longo-Ciprelli was back for her fifth and final Olympics in Sydney in 2000 at the age of 41, this time claiming bronze in the time trial -- and event in which she had also won silver in 1996.

{"article": " -- The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda on Thursday convicted the \"mastermind\" of the Rwandan genocide and sentenced him to life in prison for genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes.  Theoneste Bagosora, right, and his co-defendant Anatole Nsengiyumva, left, arrive in court.  It is the first time the tribunal has convicted high-level officials for the 100-day genocide in 1994 which left an estimated 800,000 people dead.  Theoneste Bagosora, 67, a colonel in the Rwandan army, was found guilty along with two other men -- Major Aloys Ntabakuze and Lieutenant Colonel Anatole Nsengiyumva. All were sentenced to life in prison.  The tribunal -- located in Arusha, Tanzania -- acquitted General Gratien Kabiligi, the former head of military operations, and ordered his immediate release.  CNN Chief International Correspondent Christiane Amanpour -- who covered the story -- called the verdicts \"a real turning point and a milestone in justice.\"  Watch CNN's Christiane Amanpour on the verdict \u00bb  \"It sends a message that right up the chain of command, you cannot hide,\" Amanpour said.  The court said Bagosora was a key figure in drawing up plans for the genocide. A Hutu, Bagosora was convicted of ordering Hutu militia to slaughter rival Tutsis.  The massacres began after a plane crash on April 6, 1994 that killed the presidents of Rwanda and neighboring Burundi. The court said the plane was brought down by a surface-to-air missile fired from the airport in Kigali, the Rwandan capital.  Watch what happened in the court \u00bb  Bagosora decided the military should take over and he refused to involve the prime minister, Agathe Uwilingiyimana, in any discussions, the court found.  April 7, while Bagosora held a crisis meeting with top military officials, the prime minister was arrested, sexually assaulted and killed by top members of the Rwandan Army, the court found.  Find out more about the world's killing fields \u00bb  That made Bagosora the head of all political and military affairs in Rwanda, and in that capacity, he was at the top of the chain of command.  The same day the prime minister was killed, the court said, army personnel confined and killed four important opposition leaders -- including the president of the constitutional court and government ministers -- and murdered 10 Belgian peacekeepers who had been dispatched to the prime minister's residence.  The court found Bagosora bore responsibility for those and other killings because he commanded those who carried out the crimes.  \"Bagosora was the highest authority in the Ministry of Defense and exercised effective control of the Rwandan army and gendarmerie,\" said Presiding Judge Erik Mose. \"He's therefore responsible for the murder of the prime minister, the four opposition politicians, the 10 Belgian peacekeepers, as well as the extensive military involvement in the killing of civilians during this period.\"  ICTR Prosecutor Hassan Bubacar Jallow said the convicted men \"prepared, planned, ordered, directed, incited, encouraged and approved the murder of innocent civilian Tutsis.\"  The killings were carried out by military personnel on the orders of Rwandan authorities including Bagosora, the court said.  The court found that from April to July 1994, Bagosora exercised authority over members of the Rwandan Army and their militiamen, who committed massacres throughout Rwanda with Bagosora's knowledge.  \"In all the regions of the country, members of the Tutsi population who were fleeing from the massacres on their hills sought refuge in locations they thought would be safe, often on the recommendation of the local civil and military authorities,\" the indictment said. \"In many of these places, despite the promise that they would be protected by the local civil and military authorities, the refugees were attacked, abducted and massacred, often on the orders or with the complicity of those same authorities.\"  The indictment against Bagosora alleged he had been opposed to concessions made by his government to Tutsi rebels at 1993 peace talks in Tanzania, and had left the negotiations saying he was returning to Rwanda to \"prepare the apocalypse.\"  The U.N. established the tribunal in late 1994. The trial began in April 2002 and has been deliberating since June 1, 2007.  During the trial, the court heard 242 witnesses -- 82 for the prosecution and 160 for the defense.  The three convicted men will be held in the tribunal's custody until a state can be found to house them.  The genocide's impact is still be felt today, with recent fighting in neighbouring Congo blamed on lingering tensions from the slaughter.

{"article": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- \"There's no doubt\" that the deadly attack on India's financial capital last month was planned inside Pakistan, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice told CNN on Sunday.  People in New Delhi, India, take part in a candlelight vigil for the victims of the Mumbai attacks on Sunday.  Her comments to CNN's \"Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer\" were the most definitive made by a top-ranking U.S. official regarding Pakistan's connection to the November 26-29 attack on Mumbai, in which more than 170 were killed and hundreds of others were wounded.  \"Well, I think there's no doubt that Pakistani territory was used by probably non-state actors,\" Rice said. \"I don't think that there is compelling evidence of involvement of Pakistani officials. But I do think that Pakistan has a responsibility to act, and it doesn't matter that they're non-state actors.\"  Last week, Rice traveled to the region to try to ease tension between India and Pakistan, both nuclear powers and key allies of the United States. While in New Delhi, India, she called on Pakistan to take responsibility for terrorists operating within its borders.  Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari has said \"stateless actors\" carried out the attack while Indian authorities say they believe all the attackers were Pakistanis, specifically blaming Lashkar-e-Tayyiba (LeT), an Islamic militant group based in Pakistan.  U.S. counterterrorism officials say signs point to LeT, and they haven't seen anything to rule it out. However, they have not definitively said the group is responsible. U.S. Director of National Intelligence Michael McConnell said during an appearance Tuesday at Harvard University that the Mumbai attacks were carried out by the same group responsible for the parliament attack and a series of bomb explosions aboard trains and at railway stations in Mumbai in 2006 -- though he didn't specifically name LeT.  LeT has denied any responsibility for the attacks, but a suspect in custody -- whom India has said was one of 10 gunmen in the attacks -- told interrogators he was trained by LeT, Indian authorities said. India said its forces killed nine gunmen.  On Sunday, Rice said LeT and al Qaeda \"tend to travel in the same circles,\" though she declined to directly link either group to the Mumbai attack. But she stressed that Pakistan is obligated to root out terrorists within its borders.  \"Well, I don't want to go into too much detail here because, obviously, in counterterrorism no one wants to tip the hand of what has happened here and what may happen in the future,\" Rice said. \"The important thing now is to get these perpetrators and to prevent follow-on attacks. And Pakistan's cooperation, Pakistan's action, is absolutely essential to doing that.\"  Asked about possible ties between Pakistan's government and LeT, Rice acknowledged \"there have been historic ties -- there's no doubt about that.\"  \"But Pakistan is a different place now with a civilian government and an army leadership that is working in concert to try to bring an end to extremism within Pakistan,\" she said.  \"We have to remember that Pakistan itself has been suffering at the hands of extremism. So whatever the history here, and there is a history, the important thing is that Pakistan act against those who used Pakistani soil to perpetrate attacks.\"", "Q": ["Q: Who did Condoleeza Rice say was used by non-state actors?

{"article": "KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Afghan lawmakers have directly accused Pakistan's intelligence agency of involvement in a string of deadly attacks in Afghanistan, blasting their neighbor as \"the largest center for breeding and exporting terrorism.\"  The recent attack by a suicide bomber on the Indian embassy in Kabul killed more than 40 people.  A Pakistani official Tuesday bristled at the accusation, saying that Afghan lawmakers were making allegations without proof.  \"We are not an irresponsible nation and we don't blame our failures on others,\" said a senior official with Pakistan's Directorate for Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). \"If they want to engage in this kind of game, let them be.\"  The Afghan Cabinet made the scathing indictment in a resolution Monday, saying Afghanistan would boycott a series of meetings with Pakistan unless \"bilateral trust\" is restored.  In recent weeks a wave of attacks carried out by Islamic militants have killed scores of people in Afghanistan, including an assault on a military outpost Sunday that killed nine U.S. soldiers, as well as a suicide attack on the Indian Embassy a week ago that killed 58 people.  The two incidents, along with an assassination attempt against Afghan President Hamid Karzai at a military ceremony on April 27, are \"indicative of the attempts by the ISI (Inter-Services Intelligence) to once again occupy Afghanistan and to perish the true right of the people of Afghanistan for national sovereignty,\" the resolution said.  Afghanistan regularly accuses Pakistan's intelligence service -- which once had strong ties with the Taliban -- of orchestrating attacks inside its borders.  Pakistan has repeatedly denied involvement, including in the incidents that the resolution cited. U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates also said there is no indication that \"foreign agents\" were responsible for the embassy attack.  The senior ISI official said Tuesday that if Afghanistan has proof that Pakistani intelligence agents were involved in the attacks, that proof should be presented and the ISI will act on it.  The official said that the Pakistani government could also blame incidents in Pakistan, like recent attacks in Karachi and Hangu, on others. But without proof, he said, it would be irresponsible.  Pakistan and Afghanistan have a tumultuous history that dates back several years. During the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan in the 1980s, religious schools in Pakistan helped train fighters who battled the Soviets.  After the Taliban took over Afghanistan in 1996 and imposed fundamentalist rule, Pakistan was one of the few countries that recognized the regime diplomatically.  It dropped its support after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in Washington and New York. But Afghanistan claims that Pakistan continues to informally support the militants, who operate from havens in Pakistan's lawless tribal regions near the porous 1,500-mile border the two countries share.  Adding fresh ammunition to the suspicions, the Rand Corp. -- a U.S. think tank -- released a report last month that said some members of Pakistan's intelligence service and its paramilitary corps were helping insurgents in Afghanistan.  The study, funded by the U.S. Defense Department, alleged that members of the two agencies often tipped off militants to the location and movement of coalition forces trying to rout them. It also said personnel within the agencies trained fighters at camps in Pakistan, financed them and helped them cross the border into Afghanistan.  The Pakistani military denied and denounced the report, calling it a \"smear campaign\" designed to \"create doubts and suspicion in the minds of (the) target audience.\"  Relations between the two countries are strained to such a point that Karzai has threatened to send troops across the border to take on the militants.  \"The people of Afghanistan and the international community have come to the reality that Pakistan intelligence institutions and its army have become the largest center for breeding and exporting terrorism and extremism to the world and particularly to Afghanistan,\" Monday's resolution said.", "Q": ["Q: Where is the largest center for breeding and exporting terrorism?

{"article": "  -- Roger Federer has been hit with a $1,500 fine for swearing at the umpire during his shock U.S. Open final defeat to Juan Martin Del Potro.  Federer argues with umpire Jake Garner during his five-set defeat to Del Potro.  The world number one became embroiled in an argument with Jake Garner at the end of the second set after complaining Del Potro was taking too long to decide whether or not to make challenges.  The Argentine successfully overturned an \"out\" call shortly before Federer's outburst, a point that led to him breaking serve and eventually taking the set.  During the exchange Federer was picked up on microphones telling Garner: \"Don't tell me when to be quiet, okay? When I want to talk, I'll talk.\"  Del Potro went on to claim his first grand slam, ending Federer's five-year unbeaten run at Flushing Meadows and denying the Swiss maestro a 16th grand slam title.  Federer's fine pales in comparison to the one meted out to Serena Williams, who was docked $10,000 for an altercation with a line judge at the climax of her semifinal with eventual winner Kim Clijsters.  Williams reacted angrily after being called for a foot fault, and unleashed a torrent of abuse at the official, who reported the exchange to umpire Louise Engzell.  The resulting penalty point for a code violation handed the match to Clijsters.  Williams later apologized for the incident. She was also fined $500 for racket abuse in the same encounter.  Over $31,000 in fines were handed out in the final grand slam of the season with Daniel Nestor, from Canada, forced to pay $5,000 for unsportsmanlike conduct towards a fan he confronted.

{"article": "New York (CNN) -- The serendipitous occurrence of this year's Thanksgiving holiday on the same evening as the Muslim Eid-ul-Adha is a festive occasion to reflect on the place of Islam in American collective consciousness and on Muslims as Americans.  On the same evening that millions of Americans gather around their Thanksgiving dinner to celebrate this most American of holidays, even more millions of Muslims around the globe, including the growing number of American Muslims, will do the same -- celebrating as well one of the most definitive moments of their faith -- Prophet Abraham's willingness to sacrifice his son for his God.  This holiday celebration comes soon after the tragic incident at Fort Hood, when the atrocious act of a mass murderer put Islam and Muslims under some pressure to either denounce or defend their faith.  The psychotic act of Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, MD, a Muslim American military psychiatrist at Fort Hood who went on a rampage killing 13 U.S. soldiers and wounding 30 others, has prompted two diametrically opposed reactions.  On one side are people who say that Islam -- and Islam alone -- is inherently violent and by extension Muslims are constitutionally driven to murder, while on the other are apologetic Muslims who argue their faith is peaceful and benevolent -- unrelated to criminal acts such as Hasan's.  The fact is that Maj. Hasan and Osama bin Laden have as much claim on Islam as do Muhammad Ali, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and the Persian poet Mawlana Jalal al-Din Rumi, who is the best-selling poet in America. Islam is an abstraction and any Muslim, saintly or satanic, detested or beloved, can and does have a claim on it -- and Islam is not the only world religion with this proclivity for good and evil.  The distinguished New York Times columnist David Brooks, one of the most consistently militant warriors in his take on American involvements in Afghanistan and Iraq, takes Islam -- and Islam alone -- to task for having a diabolic roughness on its fringes. But even if so, Islam is not alone in this failure to curtail murderous instincts.  The same Hinduism that produced Mahatma Gandhi and his non-violent theory of civil disobedience has also produced Hindu fundamentalists who sliced and skewered pregnant Muslim women alive in Gujarat.  The same Christianity that produced Saint Francis of Assisi and Mother Theresa also produced children's crusades and Spanish conquistadors who burned native Americans alive 13 at a time (according to the 16th-century Spanish Dominican priest, Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas) in honor of the Twelve Apostles and Jesus Christ. It also produced American Seung-Hui Cho who killed 32 students and himself at Virginia Tech and American John Wayne Gacy, Jr., who raped and murdered 33 young men and boys in Chicago, Illinois, in the 1970s.  The same Judaism that produced Martin Buber, Emanuel Levinas, or Primo Levi also produced the Stern Gang, Meir Kahane and Baruch Goldstein.  But the knee jerk reaction of blaming Islam and Muslims, in general, or looking for delusional links to \"al Qaeda,\" for the horrific murders at Fort Hood points to something far more fundamental, overdue, and urgent -- namely something of a psychological barrier for Americans to accept the Islamic component of their own society, culture, and history.  To avoid singling out Islam as diabolical, it is imperative for Americans to come to terms with the collectively repressed fact that by far the most important social uprising of their 20th century -- namely the civil rights movement of the 1960s -- is not as exclusively a Christian phenomenon as it is made out to be: The towering figure of a Muslim revolutionary named Malcolm X is of great importance in the history of that movement.  It took a whole generation of Americans to accept the fact that Jewish civil rights activists were instrumental in many measures of the success that was achieved in the 1960s. It is long overdue for Americans also to recognize that Malcolm X was equally, if not more, important to the civil rights movement.  The way the history of the civil rights movement is mostly remembered now, an overwhelming role is assigned to the Southern Baptist genealogy of Martin Luther King Jr. Malcolm X is delegated to a radical fringe -- portrayed as more of a menace and a hindrance than a positive force in the civil rights movement.  But without the simultaneous presence of Malcolm X as a Muslim revolutionary, the Southern Baptist pacifism of Martin Luther King Jr. would not have been as formidable a force.  Malcolm X and Martin Luther King were the yin and yang of the civil rights movement -- ennobling anger and vision coming together in hopes of realizing the dream of equality.  For more than three decades now, I have taught generations of American students who come to college having scarce read a word about Malcolm X, and yet everything about Martin Luther King Jr.  Until Americans come to terms with the fact that they are deeply indebted to a Muslim revolutionary for the fruits of the civil rights movement they enjoy today, Islam and Muslims will continue to be seen as archetypically alien and an everlasting danger to American lives and liberties.  Americans are Christians, Jews, Hindus, agnostics, atheists, and anything else in between -- but Americans are also Muslims, millions of them, and Islam has now become integral to what the distinguished American sociologist Robert Bellah termed our \"civil religion.\"  It is only apt that this particular Thanksgiving, Americans think about Eid-ul-Adha, as precious to Muslim-Americans as the occasion that has gathered us all \"at the table.\" Let's make room for Muslims \"at the table\" because -- to quote Langston Hughes -- they \"too, sing America.\"  The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Hamid Dabashi.", "Q": ["Q: Who said Ford Hood shootings were an atrocity?

{"article": " -- Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee on Tuesday said he accepts \"full responsibility\" for granting clemency in 2000 to a man authorities say gunned down four Lakewood, Washington, police officers Sunday.  Maurice Clemmons, 37, was shot and killed early Tuesday by Seattle police. He was the subject of a two-day manhunt after the four officers were killed at a coffee shop as they met before their shifts began Sunday morning.  Clemmons had a criminal history in Arkansas and Washington. In May 2000, Huckabee commuted his 108-year prison sentence to make him immediately eligible for parole, which was granted by the parole board two months later. Clemmons had been sentenced to 95 years, to run after time he was already serving on previous convictions.  In a statement on the conservative news Web site Newsmax.com, Huckabee wrote that he commuted Clemmons' sentence from 108 years to 47 years. Reports that he had pardoned Clemmons or set him free were erroneous, he said.  \"I take full responsibility for my actions of nine years ago,\" Huckabee said. \"I acted on the facts presented to me in 2000. If I could have possibly known what Clemmons would do nine years later, I obviously would have made a different decision. But if the same file was presented to me today, I would have likely made the same decision.\"  But the Arkansas prosecutor who put Clemmons behind bars told CNN on Tuesday that Huckabee was issuing clemency at \"an astounding rate\" during his tenure as governor.  \"He was exercising the clemency power at what I call a wholesale rate,\" Larry Jegley said. \"He was letting murderers out, he was letting rapists out, and he was letting the likes of Mr. Clemmons out.\"  One survey, he said, showed Huckabee issued more clemencies from 1996 to 2004 than the governors of all six surrounding states, including Texas.  He said he didn't know why so many clemencies were granted. \"That was part of the frustration that we felt with the entire process.... We never felt as though he gave victims, their families, jurors, law enforcement and the community in general an adequate explanation as to why he felt compelled to let people of proven danger go in our community.\"  Huckabee was a Republican presidential candidate in the 2008 election and has not ruled out another White House bid in 2012. During his 2008 campaign, he was criticized for granting clemency to another inmate, convicted rapist Wayne DuMond, who was later convicted of raping and murdering a woman in Missouri.  \"Between 1,000 and 2,000 requests for some form of clemency came to my desk each and every one of the 10\u00bd years I was governor,\" Huckabee said Tuesday. \"Ninety-two percent of the time, I denied the requests.\"  He noted that in Arkansas, a governor does not initiate a sentence change -- the Post Prison Transfer Board makes a recommendation to the governor after reviewing an inmate's file. The governor then can grant or deny it.  Clemmons was 16 when he was charged with robbery and burglary. \"For the crimes he committed and the age at which he committed the crimes, [a 108-year sentence] was dramatically outside the norm for sentencing,\" Huckabee said. The board unanimously recommended that the sentence be commuted.  Jegley said that while in prison in Arkansas, Clemmons had a disciplinary record for violent incidents, and that something should have tipped off the board or the governor that \"this man was not a good candidate to be put back in society, because he couldn't live in the cloistered environment of prison and stay out of trouble.\"  Watch what Jegley has to say  In the case of any form of clemency -- a commutation or a full pardon -- notice is given to the prosecutor, the judge, law enforcement officials, the attorney general and the secretary of state, as well as the media, for a public response period, Huckabee said. \"The only record of public response to the notice to commute was from the trial judge, who recommended the commendation in concert with the board.\"  Jegley told CNN he was not notified of the commutation, but he doesn't \"attribute that to something sinister.... I just think that maybe the system fouled up and didn't get notification out to all the parties who were interested in it, my office included.\"  Clemmons was returned to prison after violating his parole, Huckabee said. He \"should have stayed there. For reasons only the prosecutor can explain, charges were not brought forth in a timely way and the prosecutor ended up dropping the charges, allowing him to leave prison and return to supervised parole.\"  He noted that Clemmons, who had been picked up again in Pierce County, Washington, was released on bail there only days before the officers were slain.  \"I can't explain why he wasn't prosecuted properly for the parole violations or why he was allowed to make bail in Washington state and not incarcerated earlier for crimes committed there,\" the former governor wrote.  On Sunday, Huckabee's office issued a statement saying that if Clemmons was \"found responsible for this horrible tragedy, it will be the result of a series of failures in the criminal justice system in both Arkansas and Washington state.\"  Police responded sharply to that statement. \"We're disappointed that Governor Huckabee came out in the middle of the night without calling anybody here and blamed this on the criminal justice system in the state of Washington,\" Pierce County Sheriff's Department spokesman Ed Troyer said. \"We're guessing that's probably a spin doctor, not him.\"  Huckabee wrote of Clemmons, \"I wish his file had never crossed my desk, but it did. The decision I made is one that I now wish were different, but I could only look backwards at his case, not forward. None of this is of any comfort to the families of these police officers, nor should it be. Their loss is senseless.... Our system is not perfect, and neither are those responsible for administering it.  \"The system, and those of us who are supposed to make sure it works, sometimes fail,\" Huckabee said. \"In this case, we clearly did.\"", "Q": ["Q: What was man accused of?

{"article": " -- A November 1 trial date has been set for Brian David Mitchell, who is suspected in the 2002 kidnapping of Utah teenager Elizabeth Smart, said a spokeswoman for federal prosecutors.  U.S. District Judge Dale Kimball set the trial date at a scheduling conference Friday, said Melodie Rydalch, spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office in Utah. Mitchell was not in court that day, she said.  The trial is expected to take two weeks, according to the case file. Mitchell's defense attorneys have apparently indicated they will file a motion asking for a change of venue, as the case file said Kimball set a May 26 deadline for the motion and agreed to hear arguments before July 11.  Mitchell is accused of abducting Smart, then 14, at knifepoint from her bedroom in her family's Salt Lake City, Utah, home in June 2002. Smart was found nine months later, walking down a street in the Salt Lake City suburb of Sandy with Mitchell and his wife, Wanda Eileen Barzee. Mitchell, a drifter and self-described prophet who called himself \"Emmanuel,\" had done some handyman work at the Smarts' home.  Barzee, now 64, pleaded guilty in November to kidnapping and unlawful transportation of a minor. As part of a plea deal with prosecutors, she agreed to cooperate in the state and federal cases against her husband.  Earlier this month, Kimball ruled Mitchell, now 56, is competent to stand trial. State court proceedings against him have been on hold pending the outcome of the federal case.  Smart, now 21, testified in October as part of Mitchell's competency hearing that after kidnapping her, Mitchell took her to a wooded area behind her home and performed a mock marriage ceremony with her before sexually assaulting her. She testified that in the nine months of her captivity, no 24-hour period passed without Mitchell raping her.  Kimball's ruling on Mitchell's competency cannot be appealed until after the case concludes.  Barzee had been housed at the Utah State Hospital while courts determined her competency as well as that of her husband. A state court had ruled she could be forcibly medicated, and that ruling led federal prosecutors to file charges against her.  Last month, Barzee pleaded guilty but mentally ill in state court in the attempted kidnapping of Smart's cousin a month after her kidnapping. In exchange for the plea to one count of conspiracy to commit aggravated kidnapping, state prosecutors dropped charges against Barzee in Smart's abduction.  Federal prosecutors have recommended that Barzee serve a sentence of 15 years, but asked that her sentencing date be continued to allow for her participation in the case against Mitchell. She faces between one and 15 years in prison on the state charge, but prosecutors agreed to allow that sentence to run concurrently with the federal sentence.", "Q": ["Q: when was she found A:", "Q: Who was charged with kidnapping Elizabeth Smart from her bedroom?

{"article": " -- Argentine coach Diego Maradona has urged Carlos Tevez to quit Manchester United at the end of the season and head for Italy.  Tevez has been advised by Argentine coach Maradona to leave Old Trafford at the end of the season.  Maradona watched United trounce Chelsea 3-0 last weekend at Old Trafford where striker Tevez remained on the bench despite a rousing reception when he went on a touchline warm-up during the game.  \"I saw the Manchester United match. They won, but did so without Tevez. This situation is not good for him. For sure, certain things are happening which mean his departure is nearing,\" Maradona told Italian newspaper Corriere dello Sport.  \"Italy, and Inter (Milan) in particular, would be great for him. Among other things, the fact that his contract is soon to expire facilitates a change of shirt.\"  Weekend reports claimed that United manager Alex Ferguson has already pinpointed Lyon's French international striker Karim Benzema as his chief summer target.  Benzema, whose contract runs until 2013, made his mark against United in a Champions League tie last season when he scored in a first leg tie.  He hit the target 20 times as Lyon secured a seventh straining French League title and he has netted five times in this season's Champions League.  Lyon are said to be willing to cash in at the right price with Spanish giants Barcelona and Real Madrid also monitoring the situation.  Media reports said Lyon would want around \u00a340 million (45 million euros) for Benzema  while the asking price for Tevez -- he joined United on a two-year loan -- is likely to be around \u00a332 million.  Tevez, who hit the headlines during two seasons in Brazil with Corinthians, has struggled to retain a starting place at Old Trafford following his controversial stay at West Ham.  He has indicated he would respond positively to any approach from Real Madrid, but is sure to take on board the advice of Maradona who twice led Napoli to the Serie A title after joining the Italian club from Barcelona.  Meanwhile, West Ham face a fresh inquiry after the FA and Premier League launched an investigation relating to dealings with Tevez's representatives after the club had initially been fined \u00a35.5m for breaching league rules over third-party agreements.  It follows the findings of an arbitration tribunal in favour of Sheffield United and against West Ham last year which decided Tevez should not have been able to play for the Hammers at the end of the 2006-07 season.  Premier League West Ham insist that they have nothing to hide.", "Q": ["Q: What team is associated with Diego Maradona? A:", "Q: Who beat Chelsea last weekend?

{"article": "Editors' Note: Below is an excerpt from Larry King's new autobiography \"My Remarkable Journey\" published by Weinstein Books. Larry King anchors \"Larry King Live at 9 p.m. ET on CNN.  In 1959, Bobby Darin, left, was Larry's first major guest on his WKAT radio program.  Larry Zeiger left Brooklyn, New York, for Miami Beach, Florida, at the age of 23 to try to find a job in radio. This is how he got his new name:  I went to stay with my Uncle Jack in Miami Beach.  I was so excited that I started knocking on doors the next day.  I stopped at a small station on First Street, WAHR. The guy in charge liked my voice. \"We get a lot of people coming and going,\" he told me. \"If you hang around, you'll get the first opening.\"  I sat and watched in fascination for a few weeks. It was a tiny operation, but the sight of the UPI and AP machines furiously clicking out news made me feel like I was on the brink of something big. Miami Beach was like a dream. The palm trees. The ocean. I remember walking past Joe's Stone Crab. Joe's is more than a restaurant, it's a landmark.  It was full when I arrived in 1957, and I guarantee you, people will be waiting in line tomorrow night. I stopped outside the front window with only a few dollars in my pocket, unable to afford a meal, looking at the happy faces, wondering what it would take to get into a place like that.  Then came my big break. There was a morning deejay named Tom Baer. He was making sixty dollars a week and his alimony was sixty-five. He claimed to be living off the coconuts falling from trees. He quit on a Friday, and the general manager told me I could start on Monday.  I must have rehearsed the entire weekend. I don't even think I slept. On Monday morning I showed up at WAHR with the record that would play my theme song, \"Swingin' Down the Lane.\"  The general manager called me into his office to wish me good luck. \"By the way,\" he said, \"what name are you going to use?\"  \"What do you mean?\"  \"You can't use Larry Zeiger,\" he said. \"It's too ethnic. People won't be able to spell it or remember it. You need a better name.\"  There was no time to think about whether this was good or bad or what my mother would say. I was going on the air in five minutes. The Miami Herald was spread out on his desk. Face-up was a full-page ad for King's Wholesale Liquors. The general manager looked down and said, \"King! How about Larry King?\"  \"OK,\" I said. This was the opportunity of a lifetime. I wasn't going to blow it.  \"Fine. You'll host The Larry King Show.\"  Nine o'clock was approaching. That's when the news came on. A few minutes later, The Larry King Show would make its debut. I went through the control-room door, sat down, and set up my record. The news ended. I started my theme song, then faded down the music so I could introduce myself. I opened my mouth. It was as dry as cotton. For the first time in my life, I couldn't speak.  So I brought \"Swingin' Down the Lane\" up again and faded it once more. Again, not a single word came out of my mouth.  I could only wonder if listeners were hearing the pounding of my heart. I'd waited for this moment my whole life. How could I be blowing it? Once more, I cranked up \"Swingin' Down the Lane\" -- but not a word came out of me.  The next thing I knew, the general manager was kicking open the door to the control room. \"This is a communications business!\" he roared in a way that only a general manager can. Then he turned, walked out, and slammed the door behind him.  Shaken, I leaned in to the microphone and said, \"Good morning. This is my first day ever on the radio. I've always wanted to be on the air. I've been practicing all weekend. A few minutes ago, they gave me my new name. I've had a theme song ready to play, but my mouth is dry. I'm nervous. And the general manager just kicked open the door and said, 'This is a communications business!'\"  That's how my career started on May 1, 1957. Years later, Arthur Godfrey would tell me, \"The only secret in this business is...there is no secret.\" He was right. I learned a great lesson on my first day. There's no trick to being yourself.

{"article": "JERUSALEM (CNN) -- Israel makes no secret that it sees Iran is its biggest threat but the scale of the threat is less clear cut.  Israel's recent military exercises are seen by some as a show of strength to Iran.  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not missed an opportunity to name Iran as the number one threat, and like his predecessors he has said Israel will not tolerate a nuclear Iran.  Tests are ongoing for Israel's arrow missile system, designed to intercept incoming rockets -- although Israel does not openly say which direction they'd come from.  Last week, CNN filmed Netanyahu aboard an F15 fighter-bomber jet while touring the Hatzerim air force base near Beersheva. He said: \"My biggest impression today is the obligation to carry out the mission of defending Israel.\"  Last month, two Israeli warships and a submarine made a rare journey through Egypt's Suez canal. Last year, the Israeli air force tested its fighter jets and helicopters on a 870-mile sortie -- roughly the distance between Israel and Iran's main uranium enrichment plant at Natanz.  The official line... Israel's security is a continuing concern. The common perception is that some, if not all of these exercises were a show of strength for Iran.  Estimates of when Iran could have a nuclear bomb differ widely.  In February, the Institute for Science and International Security released a report that concluded Iran does not have a nuclear weapon but does have enough low-enriched uranium for a single nuclear weapon.  But an official at the International Atomic Energy Agency cautioned about drawing such conclusions. The U.N. nuclear watchdog agency said Iran's stock of low-enriched uranium would have to be turned into highly enriched uranium to be weapons-grade material.  The official said in February that Iran has not done so, and the agency's monitors and surveillance equipment at the Natanz facility would be able to detect any such activity.  Dore Gold, former Israeli ambassador to the United Nations said, \"The IAEA has inspected the known nuclear sites of Iran. But it's believed they still have other clandestine nuclear sites where they may be enriching uranium or they may be pursuing a plutonium route like the North Koreans. So there's a certain amount of uncertainty in any assessment in the timeline of an Iranian bomb.  Iran says its nuclear ambitions are for peaceful means, and Israel is widely believed to have nuclear weapons itself.  But Israel's Defense Secretary Ehud Barak, at a meeting with U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates recently, made it clear he believes U.S. attempts at negotiations with Iran have a shelf-life.  \"We clearly believe that no option should be removed from the table and this is our policy. We recommend to others to take the same position, but we cannot dictate it to anyone.\"  Efraim Kam, an Israeli analyst on Middle East affairs and author of \"From Terror to Nuclear Bombs: The Significance of the Iranian Threat,\" estimates that \"theoretically\" Iran could develop a nuclear bomb within the next year.  But even if Israel's conviction is correct that Iran wants a nuclear weapon and it is close to achieving that desire, does that mean it would use it against Israel?  Kam said: \"My personal view is that Iran would not do it because they understand that Israel does have a nuclear arsenal. It has to take that into account and because the U.S. will deter Iran as well.  \"If you ask me, can you guarantee they will not use it, then no I can't.\"  But that question is a step too far for Israel. It is far more concerned with what a nuclear Iran could do to the balance of the Middle East and the likely nuclear race that would follow with many of Israel's neighbors.

{"article": "JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (CNN) -- Ten South African ministers and the deputy president have resigned as President Thabo Mbeki prepares to leave office.  South African President Thabo Mbeki announced his resignation in a televised address Sunday.  His replacement, African National Congress Deputy President Kgalema Motlanthe, will be sworn in as South Africa's president Thursday.  Mbeki announced he was resigning on Sunday, prompting threats from several Cabinet members to follow suit -- but the outgoing president urged them to stay in office, government sources said.  The resignations, which include Finance Minister Trevor Manuel and Defense Minister Mosiuoa Lekota, will take effect Thursday when Mbeki steps down, a government statement said.  \"All the ministers have expressed their availability to assist the incoming administration in the hand-over process and any other assistance that might be sought from them,\" the statement said.  The finance minister's assistant told CNN that Manuel is willing to serve in the new government, if needed.  Three deputy ministers have also tendered their resignations, a government statement said.  A spokesman for South Africa's ruling party, the African National Congress, confirmed that it has named Motlanthe as its choice to succeed Mbeki. Motlanthe will stay in office until elections in the spring of next year, which ANC President Jacob Zuma is widely expected to win.  Earlier this month, the ANC asked Mbeki to step down after a judge threw out the corruption, fraud and racketeering case against Zuma -- Mbeki's political arch rival. The judge called the case invalid and accused Mbeki's government of political interference.  Mbeki -- who has been South Africa's president for nearly 10 years -- spoke of some of his achievements when he formally announced his resignation on Sunday during a televised address.  Watch the significance of Mbeki \"falling on the sword\" \u00c2\u00bb  \"I depart this office knowing that many men and woman in South Africa have worked to achieve better lives for all,\" Mbeki said.  Under his leadership the country has had the longest period of sustained economic growth in the South Africa's history and has reached out to indigent people in an unprecedented way, Mbeki said.  Mbeki said the country still has economic, corruption and crime challenges to face in the future. And he gave his vote of confidence to the country's next leader without naming who that leader would be.  Gwede Mantashe, secretary-general of the African National Congress, announced Saturday that the party -- which Mbeki has been involved with since his teens -- had asked him to leave before his term was up.  Mbeki agreed to do so, he said.  Mantashe said the ANC made the decision \"for the citizens of South Africa, so there could be stability within the country\" and so the ANC movement could remain \"stable and unified.\"  The case against Zuma -- who replaced Mbeki as ANC president last year -- was thrown out in September 2006, but the National Prosecuting Authority recharged him. Judge Chris Nicholson made no ruling on Zuma's guilt or innocence, and he could be recharged.  Political observers doubted that would happen because of Zuma's popularity, particularly with the Communist Party and trade unions.  Zuma has denied the charges. He said the case was politically motivated, and harmed his chances to become the ANC's presidential nominee.  He could have faced at least 15 years in jail if convicted of accepting bribes from a company that got a contract in a multibillion-dollar arms deal.  He also faced charges of having a corrupt relationship with his former financial adviser, Schabir Shaik, who is serving a 15-year sentence for soliciting bribes for Zuma and using Zuma's political influence to benefit his businesses.  Mbeki, 66, succeeded Nelson Mandela as South Africa's president in June 1999. Critics alleged he pushed for the corruption charges against Zuma.  Mbeki recently brokered a power-sharing deal between Zimbabwe's political rivals, who signed the agreement on Monday in an effort to put aside the violent past and end the crisis that has paralyzed Zimbabwe since disputed national elections in March.  Under it, longtime Zimbabwean leader Robert Mugabe remains president, while his perennial rival, Morgan Tsvangirai, has become prime minister and the coordinator of government affairs.", "Q": ["Q: What position does Kgalema Motlanthe have?

{"article": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- Almost all British troops in Iraq are being pulled out because the agreement that allows them to be there expires on Friday, the British Ministry of Defence said Tuesday.  Nearly all of Britain's troops in Iraq will have left by the week's end.  The withdrawal marks the first time since the invasion of Iraq more than six years ago that there will be almost no British troops in the country. The only British troops there will be a group of about a dozen helping to train Iraqi police as part of a NATO mission, the ministry said.  The United Kingdom's remaining contingent of 100 to 150 troops is leaving Iraq for neighboring Kuwait, a Ministry of Defence spokesman told CNN. He declined to be named in line with policy.  \"The small handful of British military personnel operating in Iraq will be withdrawn to Kuwait after Iraq's parliament adjourned without passing a deal that would let them stay,\" the spokesman said.  Iraq must give its permission for foreign troops to be on its soil.  It was a group of Iraqi lawmakers loyal to anti-American Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr that prevented parliament from approving a new agreement on British troops.  They walked out of parliament as a group on July 11, depriving the legislature of the minimum number of lawmakers necessary for votes to take place. Parliament is now on summer recess until September 8.  Fawzi Akram, a lawmaker from the Sadr bloc, confirmed that the bloc reject the Iraqi-British security agreement. He said that Iraq does not need the British troops and that Iraqi security forces are ready to handle security on their own.  Britain hopes the Iraqi parliament will eventually approve the security agreement.  \"While this delay is unfortunate, we are continuing to seek a solution with the Iraqi Government that will provide our forces with the sound legal basis they need,\" the ministry said in a written statement.  The British troops who are being pulled out include Royal Navy servicemen who have been helping the Iraqis to protect oil fields around the port town of Umm Qasr, according to the Ministry of Defence spokesman.  All British combat troops have already left the country, another ministry spokesman told CNN.  There were about 46,000 British troops in and around Iraq at the peak of major combat operations in March and April 2003, according to the Ministry of Defence.

{"article": "LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Natalie Cole's search for a new kidney ended this week when someone with a compatible organ died and their family asked that it be given to the singer, according to the organ procurement group that handled the donation.  Natalie Cole received a kidney transplant Tuesday in Los Angeles.  Cole, who underwent a successful kidney transplant at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles Tuesday, was \"responding well and recuperating\" Thursday, her publicist said.  Cole had been on what she called \"a very long list\" of people waiting for an organ donation when she got word recently that OneLegacy, an organ procurement agency in Southern California, had a kidney that was a biological match.  It was a \"directed donation\" from a deceased organ donor, according to OneLegacy CEO Tom Mone.  \"Having heard of Ms. Cole's need for a kidney, the family asked that one of their loved one's kidneys be transplanted to Ms. Cole if they were a match,\" Mone said.  Directed organ donations are rare, and rarer still are those directed to someone not related to or known personally by the deceased, he said.  The donor will remain anonymous until the family gives permission for the name to be made public, he said.  Cole's need for a kidney donation was highly publicized, including with an appearance on CNN's \"Larry King Live\" on March 31.  \"I'm on a very long list, which is why we are looking to donors,\" said Cole, the daughter of legendary crooner Nat King Cole.  Cole said her kidney troubles date to February 2008 when she was diagnosed with Hepatitis C. Cole said she attributes the Hepatitis C to her well-publicized struggles to stop using cocaine and heroin. Cole said she has been sober for some time now after two stints in a rehabilitation clinic.  Cole said she underwent chemotherapy in an aggressive way to fight the virus. Within four months of getting chemotherapy, both of Cole's kidneys failed.  \"I couldn't breathe. I -- I went into -- literally, my kidneys stopped functioning. They stopped, you know, processing the fluid that was starting to build up in my body.\"  Since then Cole has been on dialysis three days a week and has been searching for a kidney, she told King in one of the first public interviews about the issue.  Cole won six Grammys for her 1991 critically acclaimed album \"Unforgettable: With Love,\" a jazzy tribute to her father. She won a Grammy this year for her new album \"Still Unforgettable\" and another Grammy for her work on another album.  Cole was still able to tour this year even with her kidney ailment. She canceled a planned show last week in South Korea because of her illness, which meant she was in Los Angeles when the organ became available.  \"I have been on dialysis in Istanbul, Milan, Indonesia, Manila, London. It's -- it's amazing,\" Cole said.  During King's show, dozens of people sent e-mails to CNN telling Cole that they would get tested to see if their kidney could be donated.  King handed a thick stack of paper to Cole.  \"These are all e-mails from dozens -- dozens of people offering to be tested to see if they can match, who want to give you a kidney,\" King said.  Cole stared at the papers for a moment.  \"There are some great human beings out there. That's all I can say,\" Cole said.  Cole is expected to return to the tour after three to four months of recovery.  CNN's Denise Quan contributed to this report.", "Q": ["Q: When did the surgery occur?

{"article": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Hundreds of thousands of visitors to the National Mall crowded Metro stations around Washington on Tuesday, slowing movement to a crawl after the inauguration of Barack Obama as the 44th president of the United States.  A security tower stands over the crowd that came to watch Barack Obama's inauguration.  \"All of our stations are overcrowded,\" said Lisa Farbstein, spokeswoman for the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority. \"It's taking hours for people to get back into the stations.\"  Police were holding people outside some Metro stations until there was room for them to get in, Farbstein said.  But as evening fell and celebrations moved indoors, observers said crowd flow on the Metro system was smoother, if still an effort in patience.  As of 7 p.m. Tuesday, the Metro had counted 973,285 passenger trips, setting a record with several hours and many miles yet to go.  \"Throughout the weekend, we've effectively dealt with record-breaking crowds,\" said Metro General Manager John Catoe. \"By 5 p.m., people had taken nearly 874,000 trips, breaking yesterday's ridership record with nine more hours of service to go.\"  Monday's 866,681 passenger trips had been the Metro record.  The Metro numbers were just one record-setting tally in a day that lived up to expectations in sheer crowd size alone.  Crowds on the National Mall were so large that the National Park Service began closing portions of it by 9 a.m., three hours before Obama took his oath of office.  A crowd of 1.5 million people packed the Mall for the inauguration, according to an analysis of satellite imagery provided to CNN by IHS Jane's, a leading information provider on defense, international risk and national security.  Officials said the massive security for the event was running smoothly, although there had been what they described as minor miscommunications, such as a Metro station entrance being closed when it was not supposed to be. The crowd was orderly, and there had been no reports of major incidents or concerns.  FBI spokesman Jason Pack said there had been no arrests related to the inauguration so far. FBI and partner agencies investigated about a dozen reports of suspicious incidents or people, but none was anything serious.  About 957 people visited the medical tents on the mall for various first-aid needs.  Some security screening lines ran slowly, officials said, but there had not been any major systemic problems.  Earlier in the day, federal officials were reviewing an unspecified threat to disrupt the inauguration, according to the Department of Homeland Security.  The FBI was investigating two \"streams of intelligence\" suggesting that Somalia-based terrorist organization Al Shabaab may have been plotting an attack timed to coincide with the event, the FBI and Homeland Security said in a joint threat advisory obtained by CNN.  Security officials made some readjustments to inauguration security as a precaution and did not change the threat level, an administration official said.  The ceremony went off without incident.  Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice designated al-Shabaab, also known as the Mujahedeen Youth Movement, a \"Foreign Terrorist Organization\" in February.  The State Department calls it \"a violent and brutal extremist group with a number of individuals affiliated with al Qaeda. Many of its senior leaders are believed to have trained and fought with al Qaeda in Afghanistan.\"  Also Tuesday, a false alarm prompted police to temporarily close a 25-mile stretch of the New Jersey Turnpike, authorities said. Investigators had received a tip that a man headed to Washington was threatening the inaugural, but they eventually determined \"there is no danger to the public,\" FBI spokesman J.J. Klaver said.  Two law enforcement sources said the man's mother phoned in a tip to authorities saying her son was traveling in a vehicle containing a bomb.  New Jersey State Police stopped a man in a vehicle on the highway Tuesday afternoon, questioned him and searched his vehicle, several law enforcement sources said.  Officials said he never posed a threat. It's unclear what, if any, action might be taken against the mother.  Tuesday in Washington, tens of thousands of police officers, federal agents and National Guardsmen were deployed on land, water and in the air in an unprecedented effort to make sure the inauguration was secure.  The security effort involved Secret Service agents; 8,000 police officers from the District of Columbia and other jurisdictions; 10,000 National Guardsmen; about 1,000 FBI personnel; and hundreds of others from the Department of Homeland Security, the National Park Service and U.S. Capitol Police. Another 20,000 members of the National Guard were ready to respond if there was an emergency, said Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff.  Security planners drew up procedures to deal with improvised explosive devices, suicide bombers and the use of a weapon of mass destruction. A recent intelligence assessment, however, said a lone wolf would pose the greatest potential threat. Chertoff said an individual or small group planning to do harm is difficult to detect.  \"Whether the motivation is racism or some psychological disorder... in an open society, it is impossible to keep a single individual from doing some damage,\" he said.  Watch the anti-sniper detail prepare \u00bb  Federal officials acknowledged that the inauguration of the first African-American president could make an attractive target.  Since Obama's election, the number of threats against him has increased, according to a recent federal intelligence assessment.  The FBI has been especially aggressive in examining white supremacist groups. They have ramped up their anti-Obama comments, officials said, but it appears to be more talk than action.  Because inaugural events are spread over four days, security is especially challenging.  Organizers say they started their security planning the day after the last inauguration and ramped up their efforts in July.

{"article": "Beijing, China (CNN) -- Chinese President Hu Jintao greeted U.S. President Barack Obama in China's capital on Tuesday, with trade and the thorny issue of North Korea expected to be on their agenda.  The U.S. delegation was met by an honor guard at the Great Hall of the People, and Obama shook hands with Hu and other top Chinese officials before the two leaders went behind closed doors. It is their fifth meeting in the past year, and they made no public statements beforehand but are to issue a joint statement after their talks.  The United States imports billions of dollars in Chinese products each year, while China is a major purchaser of the U.S. Treasury bonds that finance America's budget deficit. Facing a global economic recession, Washington and Beijing are in \"a mutual hostage situation,\" former Bush administration China analyst Victor Cha said.  \"China needs to purchase these Treasuries in order to maintain a strong dollar. Otherwise, the value of their foreign currency holdings goes down dramatically,\" Cha told CNN. \"We need China in order to finance a lot of the deficit spending we're doing now. It's very much intertwined in a way that two countries in the history of international relations have not been intertwined.\"  China is also an important player in the diplomatic showdowns over nuclear programs in Iran and North Korea and holds one of five permanent seats on the U.N. Security Council. China is North Korea's closest ally and has played a key role in the six-party talks aimed at convincing Pyongyang to dismantle its nuclear weapons program.  A CNN/Opinion Research Corporation survey released Monday found 71 percent of Americans consider China an economic threat to the United States, with two-thirds considering it a source of unfair competition for U.S. companies.  The survey also found 51 percent of the U.S. public consider China a military threat, with 47 percent disagreeing. That 4-point margin is within the poll's 4.5 percent sampling error.  But Obama told students at a town hall-style meeting in Shanghai that the two nations don't have to be at odds with each other.  \"Our relationship has not been without disagreement and difficulty, but the notion that we must be adversaries is not predestined,\" Obama said. But he said there are certain core principles that all people must share -- including equal rights for everyone, a government that reflects the will of the people, open commerce, free access to information, and the rule of law.  \"We do not seek to impose any system of government on any other nation, but we also don't believe that the principles that we stand for are unique to our nation,\" he told the gathering.  The issue of human rights has often been a sticking point between Beijing and Washington. China regularly cracks down on its religious and ethnic minorities, keeps tight reins on the media and censors the Internet. Obama told the students that he is against censorship and is a believer in the free flow of information, calling it a \"source of strength\" in a democracy, despite the sting that sometimes comes with it.  He told the students he welcomes a strong China, saying there are very few global challenges -- specifically referring to climate change -- that can't be solved if the United States and China work together.  The town hall meeting was shown locally on Shanghai's Phoenix TV, but it was not broadcast nationally on any of China's state-run networks. The Xinhua news agency posted a translated running transcript of the event on its Web site.  The United States also streamed the forum live on WhiteHouse.gov. Chinese censors did not block the event to those with Internet access.  The final stop of Obama's trek is Seoul, where he will meet with South Korean President Lee Myung-bak, and deliver a speech to U.S. troops at Osan Air Base.  Obama is on an eight-day journey that is taking him to Japan, Singapore, China and South Korea. He'll return to the United States on Friday.

Proponents tout the change, which no other country has attempted since the 1970s, as making economic sense.  Thousands of angry Samoans protested in the streets, and one group -- People Against Switching Sides (PASS) -- unsuccessfully challenged the constitutionality of the change in the country's Supreme Court.  Opponents have also aired nightly ads depicting roadsides littered with crosses and vandalized newly-erected signs warning drivers to \"keep left.\"  Bus drivers have demanded the government compensate them to change the location of passenger door and the steering wheel.  The nation has declared Monday and Tuesday holidays for people to adjust to the change and banned alcohol sales for the next three days.  The government said it will strictly enforce the use of seat belts and has built speed bumps to prevent wrecks.  Until now, most of the cars in the Pacific island nation have been imported from the United States, where drivers travel on the right side, and Samoa's neighbor, American Samoa.  The change will allow the thousands of expatriate Samoans who live in their nation's biggest neighbors, New Zealand and Australia, to send used -- and therefore, cheaper -- cars to their families back home. In both those countries, drivers travel on the left side of the road.  \"It narrows the bridge between the rich guys and people like us, the lower class people from the rural areas,\" Fa'aleaga Young Yen told CNN affiliate TVNZ in New Zealand.

At a music store in Beijing, China, Jackson songs were being played, and his albums were put on special display. \"I rather enjoyed it (his music) because in my family my brother's generation likes his music,\" said customer Xu Wei. \"Many, many people in China like him a lot.\" Watch reaction from around the world  Although Jackson never played in mainland China, his music was among the first in the West made available there, as the peak of his popularity during the 1980s coincided with the opening up of the communist country.  On Friday, Chinese netizens had set up a Web site memorial to Jackson, and on Fanfou.com, China's version of Twitter, the pop star has become the most popular tag.  Fanfou user Layla Suen, or \"Leilajiang,\" of Shenyang city in Liaoning province wrote about her memories of Jackson:  \"When I was only four, my brother demanded that I learn his 'Thriller.' It was the second song I've ever learnt (the first one being something taught by the kindergarten teacher). Everytime I sing it at my kindergarten it would scare a bunch of little children.\"  Chinese blogger and media commentator Michael Anti wrote on his Facebook page: \"So sad about Jackson's Death, for my English first name is really named after him when I was a freshman.\"  Ethan Zuckerman, a fellow of the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University, tweeted in the hour after Jackson's death was announced, \"My twitter search script sees roughly 15% of all posts on Twitter mentioning Michael Jackson. Never saw Iran or swine flu reach over 5%.\"  As Jackson's death quickly overshadowed all else Friday, commentators worried that the world would forget about political developments in Iran.  \"Am I the only one who thinks that Michael Jackson's passing is the worst thing that could have happened to the protesters in Iran?\" wrote Melissa Cohen, or mcohen00, on Twitter.

{"article": "ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN)  -- I'm the mother of two daughters, a teen and a tween. So every day, I tiptoe through hormonally laced minefields hoping to avoid emotional carnage in response to any of my random comments or actions.  The cervical cancer vaccine, approved in 2006, is recommended for girls around 11 or 12.  As I tiptoe, I sometimes stumble, as any mother of girls that age knows. No adult woman in her right mind would knowingly, willingly utter comments that result in young people hissing, hurling verbal grenades such as, \"Thanks, Mom, for calling me fat, AGAIN.\" Or \"Are you EVEN listening to me?\" Or any version of the very popular, \"I hate YOU,\" \"I hate you SO much,\" \"I hate this family,\" or just plain \"AAAARRRRGGGHHHHH!\" followed by stomping feet and slamming doors.  So given this background, you might understand why, when I chose to broach the subject of the latest vaccine for young girls, I was braced for a fight. Oddly enough, for once, the battle didn't come.  I told my teenage daughter I wanted her to get the HPV (human papillomavirus) vaccine the next time she went to see her doctor.  \"I don't want to.\"  \"Well, sorry. You have to.\"  \"I heard it hurts.\"  \"Well, that's too bad. But it might prevent you from getting cancer later in life.\"  \"Oh. (pause) OK.\"  If you were keeping score, you might chalk that one up as a Mom win.  The only problem with that is after winning over my daughter, I now had to convince myself. This drug has its own emotional battlefields.  The HPV vaccine has been available to the public for almost two years. When Merck launched it in 2006 under the name Gardasil, many people enthusiastically embraced it as a wonder drug. Dr. Kevin Ault, associate professor of gynecology and obstetrics at Emory University's School of Medicine, says the vaccine helps women avoid an assortment of ailments, some not too serious, but others that are potentially deadly.  \"There are about 100 different types of human papillomavirus,\" he said. \"Some of them are pretty common and not dangerous, like plantar warts or warts on your hand. About 30 of them infect the genital tract, and about a dozen of them are associated with cancer.\"  Health for Her: Watch more the HPV vaccine and girls \u00bb  In this case, the cancer Ault is talking about is cervical cancer.  The National Cancer Institute estimates that in 2008, there will be over 11,000 new cases of cervical cancer diagnosed and almost 4,000 women will die from it in the United States. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration says that at least 50 percent of people who have had sex will have one type of HPV at some time in their lives.  Given those stats, this vaccine would seem like a pretty good thing, right?  The hitch is that the vaccine is suggested for adolescent girls, but the viruses in question are sexually transmitted. And that is one of the big reasons the HPV vaccine has divided parents in the question of \"to give or not to give.\"  Let's face it. Parents don't like thinking about their daughters having sex at all. Ever. Now a new drug comes along, and not only are parents told they should embrace this new vaccine for their young daughters, but it's also part of the set of routine vaccines that doctors are strongly encouraged to give their patients.  Merck says the drug has been safely tested for girls and women between the ages of 9 and 26. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that girls get the vaccine at age 11 or 12.  Ault explains why youth is key. Human papillomavirus is sexually transmitted, \"so one of the advantages of giving it to adolescents is that they are unlikely to have been sexually active, so they will not have been exposed to the virus before getting the vaccine.\" Another reason to do this early, Ault points out, is that \"our immune system is a lot better when we are 11 than when we are, say, at 22.\"  Ault also suggests that parents could use this experience to teach their children about sex and, even more important, about the realities of life, such as sexually transmitted diseases and unwanted pregnancies.  These arguments aren't convincing to some parents, the ones that are choosing not to have their daughters vaccinated. There are several reasons for doing this, including religious beliefs. Some faith-based groups feel the vaccine is inviting their young daughters to become sexually active.  Others believe the drug is just too risky. CDC spokesman Curtis Allen says the vaccine is constantly being monitored by a joint CDC /FDA hotline. Parents, patients and physicians can call the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, or VAERS, to report any adverse reaction to the vaccine.  Through a Freedom of Information Act petition, the conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch  got records from VAERS that showed three deaths in girls who'd had the vaccine in March-April 2007 and over 1,600 adverse reactions reported from June 2006 to April 2007. All said the response came after getting the HPV vaccine.  Allen cautions restraint in considering the reports. \"Most of these reactions were minor,\" he said, and the deaths \"were linked to circumstances not related to the vaccine.\" The CDC and the FDA are constantly monitoring the VAERS hotline and won't hesitate to act should they see any dangerous trends due to the HPV vaccine, he said.  The vaccine does have some known side effects. Ault has seen his share. \"I certainly hear from women who get the vaccine that it's painful, and I think some dizziness has been reported.\"  In fact, fainting has been added to the list of potential side effects to watch for. Allen says doctors are now recommending that girls stay in their doctor's office for a short period after they get the injection for just that reason.  Three injections are necessary to get the full benefit of the vaccine. The shots need to be administered over a six-month period and at this stage are guaranteed to work for at least five years.  All of this information leaves me confused. Frankly, I'm not really sure I have won myself over when it comes to the \"shot or no shot\" decision for my daughters. However, in the back of my mind, I hear the words a father spoke when he thought about not giving the vaccine to his still-young daughter.  He said, \"How am I going to be able to turn to my daughter when she's older and tell her, 'When you were younger, I had the chance of making sure you never got a certain type of cancer, and I decided not to do it' ?\"  That's an emotional minefield I truly don't think I'm emotionally equipped to walk through.

A group of men push a giant snowball across Kensington Gardens, west London Monday.  Heathrow, one of the busiest transport hubs in the world, closed both its runways for more than two hours Monday morning and operated with just one for the rest of the morning, according to BAA, the company which runs it.  London City airport is also closed, while the British capital's other two airports, Stansted and Gatwick, were operating with severe delays, BAA said.  British Airways canceled all flights out of Heathrow until 5 p.m. except for Edinburgh and Lisbon routes.

But many people in the city were delighted by the unusual weather.  \"Londoners of all ages are childishly happy to be making snowmen and having snowball fights. Bankers of all ages are throwing snowballs in the middle of the residential streets,\" Monica Majumdar told CNN in an iReport.  She lived in New York before moving to London four years ago, and was surprised by how little snow it took to bring the British capital to a standstill.  \"I have seen snow like this. But somehow, it's more beautiful here. It's partly due to the fact that even Londoners are amazed by the snow -- so there is a general air of surrealism,\" she said via e-mail. \" I do feel like I'm in a Christmas snowglobe, with all the iconic London monuments blanketed by the powdered snow.\"  London's famous red buses were pulled off the roads on Sunday night as the snow got deeper.  It was the first time \"in living memory\" that all city bus service had been suspended, including when London was being bombed during World War II, a spokesman for the city's transit agency, Transport for London, said.  \"Bus services were suspended throughout London last night on the grounds of passenger safety due to the unsafe road conditions resulting in a large number of traffic incidents across London,\" the agency said in a statement Monday morning.

{"article": "SAN DIEGO, California (CNN) -- Favorable weather and firefighter reinforcements helped ease the fire danger in parts of Southern California Thursday, but the human toll from the disaster was still coming to light.  A firefighter watches the Harris Fire. Four bodies were found in a canyon in the path of the blaze Thursday.  The number of deaths attributed directly to the fires grew to seven Thursday, after the charred bodies of four people believed to be illegal immigrants were found in a canyon east of San Diego.  Seven other deaths are labeled as fire-related: Three elderly people died during evacuations, and four others died after being evacuated.  Improving conditions allowed more people to come home Thursday, but new evacuations were ordered in areas where the unrelenting flames marched on.  Where residents could return, they often found ash and rubble in place of their homes.  \"We see pictures from online and on TV, but it's just, it's much different when you see it up front,\" said Louela Binlac in front of what remained of her Rancho Bernardo home.  \"The most important thing is that our family is still together, everybody is safe, and eventually we will rebuild again,\" she said. \"Those things you can replace. We are just all grateful that everybody is safe.\"  Rancho Bernardo resident Marilyn Wood said it was \"really scary\" to come back to the pile of ashes she once called home.

See where the fires are still burning \u00bb  Along with homes and businesses, the flames have destroyed roughly one-third of San Diego County's lucrative avocado crop, along with other croplands, greenhouses and nurseries.  A change in the winds -- from a ferocious 100 mph on Sunday to an almost manageable 10 mph on Thursday -- brought welcome relief and allowed a full-bore aerial assault on the fires.  Reinforcements from across the country arrived to aid the exhausted firefighters, officials said.  While the fires still threatened some 25,000 homes, the burn rate in the region -- a measure made up of factors like wind speed, humidity and available fuel -- was significantly lower Thursday, a spokeswoman at the California Department of Forestry and Protection said.  Residents of several communities, including the city of San Diego, were allowed to return home Wednesday and Thursday, but more evacuations were ordered -- the latest covering the communities of Lake Henshaw and Mesa Grande and the La Jolla Indian Reservation in San Diego County.  With the shifting fires, some shelters closed as others opened closer to danger.  In San Diego, Mayor Jerry Sanders announced that Qualcomm Stadium -- the home of NFL's Chargers that held 11,000 evacuees at the height of the fires but dropped to 750 Wednesday night -- would close to evacuees.  \"As we transition from a large-scale emergency evacuation center into the recovery process, we have begun assisting all evacuees to find more suitable shelter and housing,\" Sanders said.  \"Toward that end, Qualcomm will close as an emergency shelter at noon tomorrow [Friday].\"  Meanwhile, arson investigations were under way in Orange and Riverside counties in connection with some of the wildfires.

In addition, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection considers the Rosa fire in Riverside County an arson case. That fire burned more than 400 acres before being fully contained.  In other arson investigations, two men have been arrested in San Bernardino County, one in San Fernando and an adult and a juvenile in San Diego County.

{"article": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- The international race among sailors, kite surfers and wind surfers to be the fastest wind-powered boat on the planet is rapidly gaining momentum as speeds reach all-time highs.  Quick sailor: French trimaran l'Hydroptere is one of the boats battling for the outright world sailing speed record.  The outright world sailing speed record -- which did not change hands for 11 years after 1993 -- has been bettered four times this year alone.  The new holder of the record, Alexandre Caizergues, of France, claimed it with an average speed of 50.57 knots (almost 60 miles per hour) over 500 meters on his kite board off the coast of Namibia last month.  Caizergues' attempt was eventually ratified by the World Sailing Speed Record Council (WSSRC) this month, when it was decided that kite boards would be eligible for the outright record.  Meanwhile, another Frenchman, Alain Thebault, has also been closely challenging for the record on his vessel l'Hydroptere. Thebault's crew hold the 500m speed record in the boat class, and also have the overall speed record in the one nautical mile category.  Then there is the Australian sailor hoping to spoil the party for the French.  Paul Larsen, aboard British yacht Vestas SailRocket, has unofficially nabbed the fastest boat record from l'Hydroptere with an average speed of 47.4 knots. Larsen achieved the speed in 22 knot winds, and shortly before his unusual \"boat\" became airborne and flipped.  Larsen's speed is just awaiting formal approval from the WSSRC. Thebault held the record with a speed of 46.88 knots.  Even the round-the-world Volvo Ocean Race has had a speed record of its own with current leader Ericsson 4 claiming the world record for the most distance sailed in a 24-hour period during the event's first leg.  According to a spokesman from the WSSRC, interest in speed sailing is steadily building, and the close competition has been giving it a boost.  \"Certainly towards the end of the year it's been very hectic. I think what has happened is that a number of competitors have been at the top end and they have all been competing against each other at the same venues.  The development of new technologies is one factor that has increased interest in trying to break these records.  \"The fact that kite boards have developed has helped... but there is still a lot of people out there that want to achieve these records,\" the spokesman said.  He said that a lot of syndicates had been involved in speed sailing for some time, and that many were only now starting to feel the benefits of their developmental work.  \"It does seem if you are going for a specially designed boat it takes a few years before you get the design right,\" he said.  The spokesman said the WSSRC had received about 50 formal applications for speed attempts during 2008. He said the council's job was not to promote the attempts but simply to oversee them in a fair and independent manner and ratify successful efforts.  The WSSRC had a number of commissioners based around the world, he said.", "Q": ["Q: What is his sport? A:", "Q: Who is Alexandre Caizergues?

{"article": "PLAYA DEL REY, California (CNN) -- The black sedan pulled up to the parking lot at Dockweiler State Beach in California, and the five members of The Lost Trailers stepped out -- no chauffeur, no publicist, no manager, no entourage.  From left to right, Jeff Potter, Stokes Nielson, Ryder Lee, Manny Medina and Andrew Nielson of The Lost Trailers.  But that's the way this rising country band rolls these days.  When they embarked on their current \"Lean, Clean and Local\" tour, they streamlined their operation in the greenest way possible.  Since September, they've reduced their carbon footprint by 132 tons.  That meant giving up their tour buses, as well as their road crew and traveling with their own equipment.  Their new buzz phrase is \"hiring local\" -- local roadies, local T-shirt vendors, local suppliers for amps and equipment. If they can't stuff it in a suitcase, they don't bring it.  The Lost Trailers have also partnered with Keep America Beautiful, a national organization dedicated to litter reduction and recycling.  On a recent day off in Los Angeles, singer Ryder Lee, guitarist Stokes Nielson, bassist Manny Medina, keyboardist Andrew Nielson and drummer Jeff Potter met up with a group of young adults from the L.A. Conservation Corps for a little coastal cleanup -- country style.  Watch the band at work on the beach \u00bb  Three of the band members sported cowboy boots as they sifted through the sand. The kids were from South Central Los Angeles, an inner-city area not generally known for its love of country music.  After the cleanup, we pulled the CNN van up to the beach, popped in The Lost Trailers' CD, and hit \"play\" on their hit single, \"Holler Back.\" As the fiddle and banjo strains of the high-octane hillbilly tune blared through the speakers, there were blank stares all the way around from the students.  But after joining in the chorus of \"heys\" and \"hos,\" one young man named Virgil LaFlora started rapping over the verses. It was the most unexpected country/hip-hop mash-up since Tim McGraw and Nelly joined forces for \"Over and Over\" in 2004.  All of a sudden, the two camps had discovered some common ground, and the song ended in cheers and hugs. One girl asked if she could have the CD.  CNN talked to the Trailers' members about their activism and their tour. The following is an edited version of the interview.  CNN: \"Lean, Clean and Local\" isn't just about recycling. You guys are actually going into the community and hiring local people.  Stokes Nielson: We did a show with Tim McGraw in New York at the end of last year. It was a fly date for us, so we hired local, and this guy came up to us and said, \"Thank you so much for hiring local, 'cause I haven't had a check in three weeks.\" And we realized as the recession was heading into place, that one of the things we could do to benefit these communities is hire local, and not just bring in our own crews and just extract money form the locals and then leave, but we could also leave a small stimulus of our own.  CNN: As rising artists, you work hard to earn the right to have a tour bus. Now you're giving it up.  Stokes Nielson: Since we won't have a crew, we thought, \"OK, we're not going to have the bus anymore, and we're just going to fly to dates,\" and that cut down our diesel consumption.  Andrew Nielson: We travel really light so that we can roll into town, hire the crew, and also hire local equipment. Potter's a drummer, and everywhere we go, we rent drums.  Jeff Potter: We were trying to figure out a way that was practical to get a drum set on a plane, but it didn't really work out. I like it because I get to show up, and somebody working there locally has already set it up for me, and I get to just sit down and play.  Ryder Lee: We were trying to get Potter some of those electric drum pads (which will fit into a suitcase), but that's just not as cool.  CNN: Or you could just get a drum machine and eliminate the problem altogether! That would save the most money.  Potter: I like being in the band.  Manny Medina: I'm afraid they're going to hire local bass players, and I'll be out of a job! (Laugh)  CNN: Do you save money by hiring local, or does it cost you more this way?  Stokes Nielson: No, it's about even. It's not about the money. Obviously, the government is putting a lot of money into trying to get this thing (the economy) kick-started. As small-business owners, we want to do our part as well. It's also really been great to realize that we actually can do something besides just writin' a song and singin' it.  Lee: We've set up a Web site: LeanCleanAndLocal.com, and that's become kind of a Yellow Pages for the local businesses we've hired. And we have videos on there, and a directory of the folks we've used, so if other acts were to hire this way, they could come in and use these same people.  CNN: Doesn't that lead to disaster sometimes?  Medina: So far, it's been great.  Potter: Either we've been very lucky, or we've really come up against some great people, but when you're a national act, there's a certain level of competence with the people you deal with, and that's great to see.  CNN: I'm sure there were a lot of organizations you looked at before partnering up with Keep America Beautiful. Why that organization?  Lee: I think as country artists, it's really important to preserve the things that we grew up with. We're naturally outdoors men because of where we grew up, and keeping the rivers and streams clean is part of being country, and we're really proud of that. And Keep America Beautiful and their efforts in recycling and litter cleanup was really fitting for us, so it was a natural place to reach out -- not to mention, at our shows, there tends to be a few bottles and cans that build up. (Laugh)  Stokes Nielson: This tour may not last forever. Maybe just until the recession is over. But definitely, we want to do our part to give back.  Medina: Plus you really get to know the towns better. You meet the people. You don't just stay on your bus, play a show and leave.

{"article": "MOSCOW, Russia (CNN) -- Natalia Vodianova is the Russian supermodel and philanthropist described by designer Tom Ford as \"the most beautiful woman in the world.\"  Natalia Vodianova: \"I think protecting your family and giving to them is the most important achievement.\"  Natalia, 27, is a mother of three and has set up her own children's charity. The woman nicknamed \"Supernova\" tells My City_My Life about her tough childhood, her love of Moscow and why Russian vodka is the best.  CNN: How would you describe Moscow?  Natalia Vodianova: It's a city of contrasts. You have this great culture and traditions that are very normal, calm and established. And then you have explosions of emotion, craziness, art, and young people who are so proud to be Muscovites and really trying to be individuals.  Moscow is a huge inspiration for me. I love what I find here, I love being here.  CNN: What would you change about Moscow given the chance?  NV: Definitely the way it's treated at the moment, the way the government wants to renovate the old buildings. To me it's a little bit sad because in the West people have a very different mentality about renovating buildings, keeping them as intact as possible.  Watch Natalia Vodianova take CNN on a tour of Moscow. \u00bb  CNN: What's the fashion in Moscow?  NV: You see women in jeans wearing very high heels and a short puffy jacket. It's really funny!  CNN: Tell me about your childhood  NV: I was born in Nizhny Novgorod to a very poor family and unfortunately my father and mother separated when I was very little.  She was a single mum and had two more girls. It was a struggle but we all worked really hard and stood up for each other. My mum was amazing; she never drank, she never smoked -- she lived for us. I appreciate what she has done for me and the way she raised me.  CNN: Is family very important to you?  NV: I think protecting your family and giving to them is so important. It's the most important achievement.  CNN: How did your modeling career take off?  NV: I went to Paris when I was 17. I was lucky because my career kind of gradually built up over two years -- I always had good work but I wasn't a star straight away.  In fact, my agency thought that I might never do shows because I was a bit shorter and not skinny enough, but when I gave birth to my first son I was 19 and I lost a lot of weight.  I guess the stress on the body was extreme and I suddenly just turned into this stick -- just the way designers love models. My career took off after Lucas was born because I opened a lot of shows on the runway and that's where a lot of stars are made in my industry.  See Natalia Vodianova's Moscow in photos. \u00bb  CNN: If you weren't a model, what would your life be like?  NV: It's very hard to say what my life would be like if I hadn't gone to Paris. People say I didn't change very much but I don't think that's true.  I'm a happy person and even if I thought that I was happy then, I had so much baggage to carry with me: my background, people's expectations, the fact that I wasn't a perfect student and I wasn't going to school all the time -- I didn't live a normal life at all.  That's not with me anymore, because of my success. It really doesn't matter because I know I have learned so much more than a lot of other girls who have had perfect childhoods.  CNN: Tell us about the charity and what you are trying to achieve with it?  NV: I started my foundation in 2005, after the Beslan tragedy [the 2004 school siege in which at least 339 hostages were killed]. I was in Moscow at the  time and it just struck me so much.  I went back to New York, where I was living at the time, organized a fundraising event and raised $350,000 to build a playground for the children that had survived in the area. I believe that play is very therapeutic. It's really the only way for these children to forget about what happened and just be children, even if it's only for five minutes.  But then I realized that it would be good for all the other children in Russia and I just started raising money and building playgrounds. Now we have 23 places all over Russia and we are building 15 more this year and planning to build more.  I want to fulfill my dream of building 500 play parks in Russia. Each one will cost about $300,000 so it's a big dream -- an expensive one!  CNN: Let's talk about vodka...  NV: Our vodka is definitely the best. It's a very pure, good drink and it goes with Russian food. Generally I don't drink vodka outside Russia, but when you come to Russia there is no reason to order a glass of wine.  CNN: What do you think of your nickname -- Supernova?  NV: I don't mind being called Supernova. If one nickname is going to stick, that's not a bad one!  CNN: Which five words best describe Moscow?

{"article": "San Diego, California (CNN) -- Don't be surprised if, any day now, you read that the People's Republic of Arizona is in the market for nuclear warheads to put an end, once and for all, to illegal immigration on its southern border. After all, it's the next logical step for the rogue state.  This week, to advance the narrative that Arizona has no choice but to do its own immigration enforcement because the federal government is asleep at the switch, Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer called for air support. Brewer requested helicopters and unmanned aerial vehicles from the White House to patrol the border region with Mexico.  In a letter to President Obama, Brewer asked that the National Guard reallocate reconnaissance helicopters and robotic surveillance craft to the \"border states\" to prevent illegal immigration. The governor also requested the deployment of unmanned drones, including possibly the Predator drones used in Iraq and Afghanistan. In fact, in her letter, Brewer even mentioned those foreign wars as examples of where the drones have been effective.  What's the matter with Arizona? Isn't it a little early in the year for the folks in the desert to be suffering from sunstroke?  I guess this is par for the course. Brewer just signed SB 1070, a disgraceful anti-immigration and pro-racial-profiling law, to give local and state cops throughout the state the chance to suit up and play border patrol agent. Why shouldn't she get the chance to suit up and play general?  After all, like the United States, Arizona is currently involved in two wars. There's the hypocritical war against the very illegal immigrants that the state has spent the past 15 years providing with gainful employment by allowing them to do jobs that Arizonans wouldn't do. And then there's the rhetorical war with the Obama administration, which Arizona wants to portray as negligent in stopping illegal immigration, which forced Arizonans to take matters into their own hands.  The argument that the federal government isn't actively engaged in border enforcement is both dishonest and reckless.  It is dishonest because it's not true. I've visited the U.S.-Mexico border a dozen times in the past 10 years: in Texas, Arizona and California. I've interviewed countless border patrol agents and supervisors. I've also been up in a Border Patrol helicopter flying above the border, which offers a unique perspective on border security.  So I can tell you what the border patrol agents on the ground would tell you: The U.S.-Mexico border has never been more fortified. There are now more than 20,000 border patrol agents on the federal payroll. That's more agents than any other federal enforcement agency, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Those agents apprehend people and deport them at a feverish clip. In fact, it was recently announced that the Obama administration deported more people last year than the Bush administration during its final year in office.  It is reckless because -- when this law is hauled before a federal judge, as it will be -- opponents will argue that the measure violates the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution by usurping federal authority to enforce immigration law. And that's the very thing that proponents seem to be admitting in their bravado. In fact, it might not be a bad idea for Arizona officials to pipe down and stop bragging about how they're doing the job of the federal government in terms of immigration enforcement, since that's a no-no under the Constitution.  If the federal government does take border enforcement seriously, critics might ask: Why are there still people trying to enter the United States illegally? Simple. We can dig a moat, deploy an army, build walls or call in an airstrike, but desperate people will always find a way to go around, under or over any impediment in their path to a better life.  This isn't to condone illegal immigration. My views -- in support of deportations, workplace raids, giving more resources to the Border Patrol etc. -- are well known. I'm just telling you what Border Patrol agents tell me: that it doesn't make any sense to focus all our attention at the border while turning a blind eye to employers in the interior. That's like trying to fill a bucket with teaspoons of water without first plugging the hole at the bottom.  Now Obama has fallen into that same trap. He is reportedly ready to announce that he is sending 1,200 National Guard troops to the U.S.-Mexico border to help control illegal immigration and quell some of the violence. That's a far cry from the 6,000 troops that Arizona Sen. John McCain had requested, and congressional Republicans seem miffed that Obama stole their thunder.  Still, as long as the troops follow the protocol laid out in 2006 when George W. Bush launched Operation Jumpstart -- that they're unarmed and act only in a support capacity to the Border Patrol by fixing vehicles, monitoring surveillance equipment, repairing fences -- I think sending the National Guard is a fine idea. It's just not the magic bullet that the most enthusiastic proponents of the idea would have us believe.  There's only one of those. It involves fining, arresting and prosecuting the employers of illegal immigrants, including people who are, this election year, streaming into fundraisers for McCain, Brewer and other tough-talking Republicans vowing to solve a problem that many of their backers helped create.

{"article": "(PEOPLE.com) -- Pregnancy joy turned to sadness for the stars of TLC's \"The Little Couple,\" as they learned on Tuesday's episode of the successful transfer of an embryo to their surrogate, who later miscarried their unborn child.  Dr. Jennifer Arnold and husband Bill Klein, who both have skeletal dysplasia, a bone-growth disorder that causes dwarfism, have documented their road to parenthood on the show. They decided to use a surrogate to have a baby, because of the challenges a pregnancy could pose to her health.  On the season finale, Arnold and Klein learned their surrogate was expecting. \"After we got pregnant, the craziness ensued with us wondering what to do with the baby's room, making sure our surrogate was getting her daily dose of baby vitamins,\" Klein tells PEOPLE.  But since filming their happy visit to the doctor, the couple's surrogate lost the pregnancy. Klein had to contact his wife, a neonatologist at Texas Children's Hospital, while she was at work in order to tell her the heartbreaking news.  \"I didn't want her to be the last person to find out,\" he says. \"Ugly or happy, it needs to be told. It was a very tough day, and Jen took it harder than she originally expected.\"  \"I cried my eyes out,\" Arnold tells PEOPLE. \"I deal with families who lose their babies and I will cry with them, but I thought I would be stronger. Nothing can completely prepare for all that when it is about you.\"  When the couple were able to get together at the end of the day, they mourned, crying and comforting one another and later talking to family and friends. The next day they decided they would continue trying to start a family, with both surrogacy and adoption as possible paths.  Kim Kardashian's Marriage: Mistake or Fake?  \"Bill was a rock, and he held me through everything,\" Arnold says. \"By the next morning, I realized that I needed to try again. We were so close and so pregnant with the ultrasound looking good, and so it was horrible for it to end. But I couldn't have said I was done. A lot of family asked, 'Do you want to go through this again?' And my answer is, yes. I would be miserable if I didn't try again.\"  A Rocky Road  Because both Klein and Arnold carry a single gene for their type of skeletal dysplasia, there is a chance they could both pass the gene on to their child, which could be lethal for their baby. To avoid this, embryos are genetically tested before implantation.  If no skeletal dysplasia genes are passed on, the baby would be healthy and average sized; if one gene is passed, the baby would be a healthy little person.  Also, Jen is on medication to stimulate her ovaries, which produced only half as many eggs as expected.  \"We appreciated all the prayers and positive thinking,\" says Arnold of sharing her difficult story with the world. \"That is comforting and is giving us strength. When we lost the pregnancy, we wondered how we were going to handle it. But by sharing our story, whether it be positive or negative, I think it can help others going through similar things.\"  Ultimately, becoming parents is what means the most. \"We are so in love with each other and supportive of each other that we are going to be okay,\" she says. \"We really want to be parents, and that is the goal here through surrogacy and adoption. We are not done trying yet.\"  Kris Jenner: 'People Have to Stop Judging' Kim for Ending Her Marriage  Until that day comes, Klein cherishes life with his wife. \"I could go the next 50 or 100 years with just the two of us, because we have a great relationship,\" he says. \"Few people are so lucky to have that from the moment you meet that one person, and everything we add to our relationship is exciting.\"  Challenges -- both past and future -- will only make their bond stronger. \"We really just feel crazy fortunate to have found each other,\" Arnold says. \"We were both at a point of giving up. Being a little person, everything is a struggle, and it is wonderful when you achieve something you really wanted. You don't let that go so easily.\"  See full article at PEOPLE.com.  \u00a9 2011 People and Time Inc.

{"article": " -- Authorities are searching for a female soldier, missing after a fire at her apartment near Fort Bragg in North Carolina.  Fayetteville, North Carolina, police released this undated photo of 2nd Lt. Holley Wimunc.  Investigators Thursday morning found evidence of arson at the Fayetteville apartment of 2nd Lt. Holley Wimunc, 24.  A neighbor, Roland Petty, told CNN affiliate WRAL-TV that he saw a man running from the area on Wednesday night and smelled smoke, although he didn't associate it with the building at the time.  In a court filing for a protective order, Wimunc said that in May her husband had knocked her down, held a loaded gun to her head and then threatened to commit suicide, WRAL reported.  Watch police at work at Wimunc's complex \u00bb  The court documents indicate that John Wimunc is a Marine stationed at Camp Lejeune, the station reported.  A Camp Lejeune spokesman told WRAL that police had spoken to John Wimunc on Thursday about his wife's disappearance.  \"I haven't seen any violence. I know [Wimunc's husband] was not living here anymore, but that's all I know,\" a neighbor told WTVD-TV, another CNN affiliate.  Both stations reported that Holley Wimunc's car was still in the parking lot at the apartment.  Her disappearance is considered a missing person case.  Holley Wimunc's family, from Dubuque, Iowa, released a statement Friday saying they are \"still trying to absorb the impact of this week's stunning events.\"  \"First and foremost, our concern is for our daughter, Holley -- that she will be found and restored to us,\" the James family wrote.  \"When you read about or watch television news reports of incidents like this, you can hardly believe that it could happen to you. But it has -- we are so grateful for the thoughts, support and prayers of friends today -- something we're leaning on heavily right now.\"  The family said they would not be making any further comments, citing the investigation.  No one was inside the apartment at the time of the fire, police said.  Wimunc is assigned to Charlie Company, Womack Army Hospital at Fort Bragg, police said.  A statement from Fort Bragg said Wimunc is a nurse from Lafayette, Louisiana, who works at the hospital's mother and baby ward.  \"Womack Army Medical Center staff is very concerned about our soldier and her safety,\" Col. Terry Walters, commander of WAMC, said in the statement. \"The staff and members of her unit are being supported by the command and with counseling available through our unit chaplains.\"  The blaze comes nearly three weeks after the body of a pregnant soldier was found in a hotel near Fort Bragg.

{"article": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Obama signed an executive order granting some benefits to same-sex partners of federal employees Wednesday, calling it \"a historic step\" but promising more action to come.  President Obama has been criticized by gay rights activists for not doing more since taking office.  \"We've got more work to do to ensure that government treats all its citizens equally, to fight injustice and intolerance in all its forms and to bring about that more perfect union,\" Obama said.  The signing followed sharp criticism of the president over a Justice Department motion filed last week in support of the Defense of Marriage Act -- which effectively bars the federal government from recognizing same-sex unions. Obama said he still wants to repeal the act.  \"I believe it's discriminatory. I think it interferes with state's rights, and we will work with Congress to overturn it,\" he said.  The memorandum he signed Wednesday means same-sex partners of civil service employees can be added to the long-term care program, employees can use their sick leave to take care of domestic partners and children and same-sex partners of Foreign Service employees will be included in medical evacuations and housing allocations, according to the White House.  But it does not grant full health-care coverage, which would require an act of Congress, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said.  As details of the impending memorandum began to filter out Wednesday, the reaction of some gay rights activists was not enthusiastic.  \"I have to say, as a federal employee, I'm really disappointed,\" Lisa Polyak, 48, of Baltimore, Maryland, said of Obama's expected memorandum.  Polyak, who has worked for the federal government for more than two decades, is with the Army Medical Department. She was among the two dozen authors of the Dallas Principles, a set of eight statements that seek to guide the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community toward \"full civil equality,\" according to the document's preamble.  Watch CNN's Paul Steinhauser discuss Obama's intent on benefits to same-sex partners \u00bb  \"The benefits that the president might be announcing are already available,\" said Polyak, who has a partner and two children. \"This isn't new. This isn't different.\"  She said federal employees are able to take sick leave for \"anyone that was the close approximation of family\" and said the long-term-care option has been available for people under the same category. Polyak said not having health insurance from the federal government for her partner of 27 years costs her family $4,000 to $5,000 a year, not including co-pays or deductibles.  Asked in a conference call with reporters whether these benefits were already available to same-sex partners of federal employees, Berry said such benefits are \"subject to the whim of a supervisor.\"  \"If you have an enlightened supervisor, yes, that is a possibility (that they have been available),\" he said.  \"What the president is doing today is making this no longer optional. He is making it mandatory. And he's making it clear that this is now the policy of the federal government.\"  Polyak disagreed, saying, \"The idea that this was a fly-by-night [is]... not true. I used it routinely.\"  She added, \"It was guidance that everyone took advantage of and continues to take advantage at this moment.\"  Gay and lesbian advocates have also faulted the Obama administration for not moving to repeal the military's \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" policy that bars officials from asking about a service member's sexual orientation but also bars the service member from revealing it, and allows the dismissal of a service member if a same-sax orientation is discovered.  \"There's so little we can say until we know what it is,\" said Carisa Cunningham, a spokeswoman for Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders, a legal advocacy group that is challenging Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act in federal court in Massachusetts.  Section 3 prevents the federal government from giving Social Security and other protections to same-sex married couples.  \"Laws have to change... and in particular, the Defense of Marriage Act needs to change, so whatever the few benefits that the president as an employer can grant, there won't be a lot of them,\" Cunningham said.  President Bill Clinton signed the Defense of Marriage Act into law in 1996.  Obama rankled gay advocates in January when he selected mega-church pastor Rick Warren to deliver the invocation at his inauguration. Warren, in an interview with Beliefnet, likened homosexuality to bestiality and incest. He also supported California's Proposition 8, which banned same-sex marriage in that state.  During the Warren controversy, Obama -- who frequently spoke out in favor of gay and lesbian rights during the campaign but has said he opposes same-sex marriage -- declared himself \"a fierce advocate for gay and lesbian Americans.\"", "Q": ["Q: The criticism over what act caused the move?

{"article": " -- Sooner or later, James Richter knows the rabbit-ear antennas on his old-fashioned television will listen for a signal and hear nothing.  Old TV sets at a California recycling center last month. Many analog TV owners aren't ready to switch to digital.  The 36-year-old from Atlanta, Georgia, said he tried to convert his analog TV to digital but was turned down for a government coupon. He doesn't seem to mind.  \"With the economy, I don't have enough cash to do cable, so I'm just really debating whether or not I really want to make that switch to digital,\" Richter said.  Richter will have four months longer to make up his mind after Congress voted Wednesday to delay the end of TV's rabbit-ears era.  On June 12, analog TV signals will end and only digital signals will remain. Old televisions like Richter's won't accept the new form of broadcast.  People with cable TV or satellite service will not be affected.  The switch had been scheduled for February 17, but Congress delayed the conversion -- which had been planned for years -- to accommodate people like Richter who had not been able to update their TVs.  The National Telecommunications and Information Administration offered a program to help people buy converter boxes that make old TVs work in the new era. That giveaway didn't meet demand, though, and as of late January, more than 3.2 million people were on the program's waiting list.  More than 6.5 million U.S. households, or 5.7 percent, were not ready for the crossover last month, according to an estimate from the Nielsen Company.  There's been little made of the people behind those numbers, though, as media reports largely have focused on the mechanics of the switch and the politics of when and how it will happen. Many of those who haven't bought converters are poor, older than 55, rural residents or racial minorities, according to Nielsen's estimates. Some of them told CNN they couldn't afford to pay for cable or satellite TV service.  While a person can live without TV, some of the late converts to digital depend on television for information and companionship.  \"I live here by myself, so it will be a big deal for me,\" said Monica Lawson, a 42-year-old from rural Alto, Georgia. \"Even just a couple hours a day of having that extra interaction, it's a stress reliever for me.\"  Lawson said she got a coupon to buy the digital converter box for her analog television as soon as they became available. She's attached the box to her TV, but her signal got worse.  \"Basically I'm downgrading at this point,\" she said. \"I'll go from having four or five channels I can watch on a regular basis to having one channel I can watch every now and then -- if at all.\"  Lawson, who is a real-estate appraiser and practices kinesiology, said she can't afford satellite service because her business has dropped with the economy.  She falls into a category of people who may lose their TV coverage with the switch to digital. It's likely the result of a phenomenon called the \"cliff effect.\" While analog signals fizzle out over long distances, digital signals tend to stop completely at a certain falling-off point.  \"With digital, you get a great picture or nothing,\" said Mark Wigfield, spokesperson for the Federal Communications Commission.  Some remote areas of the country could lose reception when analog signals stop in June, said Shermaze Ingram, spokesperson for the National Association of Broadcasters, an advocacy group that has been trying to inform people about the switch since 2006.  On the whole, studies show more people will get TV signals than will lose them in the switch to digital, Ingram said. The National Association of Broadcasters supports delaying the change until June in part because it will cause fewer people to go without TV after the change.  \"There's no question that television is an important piece of the fabric of American life,\" Ingram said.  Congress elected to delay the digital switch in part because lawmakers don't want people to go without TV.  George Touchine, a 64-year-old from Gallup, New Mexico, said he has not gotten a converter coupon yet and cannot find the device in local stores. He said he will check back often, though, and hopes to be able to switch to digital in the coming days.  Like Touchine, more than 12 percent of New Mexico households in the Santa Fe and Albuquerque TV market are not ready for the switch, making the area the least prepared in the nation, according to Nielsen.  Being left out of the switch would be a big deal for Touchine. He is retired and says he spends a substantial part of his evening watching TV with his wife.  \"I just watch the news all the time, that's all I want,\" he said. \"I get the weather, the news, what's going on -- all of it -- I want to know it.\"  The annoyance of having to convert to digital may push Richter, the man in Atlanta, away from television entirely. iReport.com: 'You snooze, you lose'  Richter said he left a bad job as a local truck driver four years ago and hasn't been able to find steady work since. He's given up luxuries like cable TV, an Internet connection and movie rentals to make ends meet.  He said he applied for the free converter about a month ago but was turned down at least temporarily because all of the coupons had been given out.  He doesn't buy the idea that he needs a television to alert him about emergencies or severe weather.  \"I do have a radio and I also have a cell phone. If something's really, really bad, someone can call me,\" he said. \"And I figure if there's a nuclear war, it will be everywhere. Someone will let me know.\"  If Richter eventually gets a free converter box, he'll consider joining the digital TV world. But if not, he said won't be angry at the government for the delays.  He thinks he might be better off without all that extra noise.", "Q": ["Q: Who can not afford to pay for cable? A:", "Q: who delayed the switch? A:", "Q: What does congress do about digital TV?

{"article": " -- The Oka boys are a true band of brothers. All seven served in the military, yet they fought on opposing sides.  \"We were seven brothers -- seven soldiers,\" says 91-year old Chikara \"Don\" Oka, a World War II veteran now living in a retirement home in Los Angeles. \"Five of us for the United States and two against us because they were stranded in Japan\" when the war came. They're all American citizens born here in the United States.  In the 1920s, Oka's parents operated a migrant labor hotel in Castroville, a farm town in central California. But their dreams of riches never materialized, and the entire family returned to Japan.  In 1937, three of the older brothers -- Isao, Masao and Don -- returned to the United States in search of a better life. They worked in the wholesale produce business, and Don enrolled at Otis Parsons Art Institute in Los Angeles, hoping to be a fine artist.  Then on December 7, 1941 the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor and the brothers' dreams were put on hold. They received draft notices, and while many of their fellow Nisei -- second-generation Japanese-Americans -- were being booted out of the Army, classified as enemy aliens, the brothers found their niches.  \"All of us served -- three of us at first for MIS (the U.S. Army's Military Intelligence Service, as Japanese language specialists), and two younger ones (Teiji and Takeo) for the Japanese navy and army. The youngest ones were stuck in Japan but too young to serve. After the war, Terumasa (Ted) and Hidekazu (Dan) came back as United States citizens, and when the Korean War started, they volunteered also with the MIS.\"  \"Don\" Oka's memories of war are still vivid. Clutching a crumbling photo album, he peels back pages filled with fading photographs and hand-drawn cartoons of his Army life. The stories spill out like the loose pages in his album.  Perhaps Oka's most vivid memory is also his most poignant.  On Christmas Eve, 1944, he remembers running for cover while his younger brother Takeo -- a pilot -- dive-bombed an American camp on Tinian Island in the Marianas.  \"I remember the attack\", Oka says, \"because I was on Tinian, and here comes a plane. I look up in the sky, it was at night, and I saw those planes in a searchlight and they were shooting. I could hear the bullets coming down, and we rushed out.\"  As Takeo Oka returned to his base in Japan, he was shot down. The wreckage and his body were found on an island near Iwo Jima  \"I knew he must have been serving because he was at the age, but I didn't know until it was all over and I came back and found out he died\" Don Oka says. \"I was just hit so hard that I didn't feel right.\"  Oka picks up two photos from his tattered album. In one photo, Takeo is seated, wearing his Japanese Imperial Navy uniform and gripping a samurai sword. The other is a photo of Takeo's grave marker in the family's village, Okayama near Hiroshima.  \"What a waste,\" Oka says. \"I wish he [Takeo] were alive.\"  By 1945, Japan was losing its grip in the Pacific. Takeo's younger brother, Teiji, was conscripted into the Japanese army. He was on a troop ship sailing with hundreds of recruits toward Okinawa as reinforcements. The ship was attacked and sunk by American planes. Teiji Oka was wounded and died several years later.  Isao Oka, the oldest brother, was to ship out with the celebrated 442nd Japanese American Regimental Combat Team to Europe. Two days before, he heard the question, \"Who speaks Japanese?\"  He answered simply, \"I do!\" and was also transferred into the MIS.  Isao Oka served in the Philippines and became known as the \"voice of American propaganda.\" Using shortwave radio, he broadcast Japanese music and read news and commentaries whose goal was to demoralize Japanese soldiers throughout the Pacific islands and urge the citizens of Japan to surrender.  On July 27, 1945, a day after it was released, he broadcast the Potsdam Declaration -- the terms of Japan's World War II surrender.  \"I don't know how the reception was, but I was really happy the war was over\" he says.  Masao, the second-oldest brother and last of them drafted, saw occupation duty in two of Japan's major cities, Kobe and Osaka.  For Don Oka, the third-oldest brother, service wasn't always so metropolitan. On Tinian Island, he said, \"I saw bodies everywhere\" after a nine-day Marine battle there in 1944. Eight thousand Japanese were killed. By comparison, the 2nd and 4th Marine divisions lost 328 men. Hundreds of Japanese troops held out in the jungles for months.  Around the camp's perimeter, he saw starving Japanese soldiers scavenging for food. He'd yell, in Japanese: \"War is over around here! Many Japanese have surrendered and are in camps under our care. Please come out and surrender!\"  \"Maybe my Japanese was bad... they didn't come out, \" Oka says.  The following summer, the B-29 bomber Enola Gay flew from Tinian airfield to drop the first atomic bomb on Hiroshima.  As part of his duties on Tinian, Oka was asked to start a school for hundreds of Japanese and Korean children.  With the war in the Pacific over, Oka helped Marines in occupied Japan. They scoured the countryside for the wreckage of downed American bombers and their missing servicemen.  They never found survivors.  Oka was with the first U.S. Marine unit to meet Japanese civilians in the Shimonoseki region on the Japanese island of Kyushu.  \"I was a little frightened,\" he says of his initial contact with the Japanese civilians -- worried about perceptions that he, a Japanese-American, was consorting with the enemy. To his relief, he discovered that his shared heritage and translation skills, coupled with a respectful Marine presence, calmed everyone's fears.  The war in the Pacific ripped apart nations and families, and it divided loyalties. But Don Oka is pleased with all of his brothers' achievements.  \"I'm kind of proud,\" he says of their military service. \"But at the same time, I really hate war from the beginning.\"  He adds: \"Those brothers of mine didn't hate me. I didn't hate them. We were brothers. We were just called to do the job, and we did it.\"", "Q": ["Q: Hoe many were left behind in Japan? A:", "Q: How many Oka brothers served in the military?

{"article": "HUNTINGDON VALLEY, Pennsylvania (CNN)  -- The president of The Valley Swim Club on Friday strongly denied charges of racism after his club canceled the swimming privileges of a nearby day care center whose children are predominantly African-American.  John Duesler said he underestimated the number of swimmers who would come to swim at the club.  \"It was never our intention to offend anyone,\" said John Duesler. \"This thing has been blown out of proportion.\"  Duesler said his club -- which he called \"very diverse\" -- invited camps in the Philadelphia area to use his facility because of the number of pools in the region closed due to budget cuts this summer. He said he underestimated the amount of children who would participate, and the club's capacity to take on the groups was not up to the task.  \"It was a safety issue,\" he said.  The Creative Steps Day Care children -- who are in kindergarten through seventh grade -- went to The Valley Swim Club in Huntingdon Valley on June 29 after the center's director, Alethea Wright, had contracted to use the club once a week.  During their first visit, some children said they heard club members asking why African-American children were there. One youngster told a Philadelphia television station a woman there said she feared the children \"might do something\" to her child.  Watch Wright react to comments allegedly aimed at the children \u00bb  Days later, the day care center's $1,950 check was returned without explanation, Wright said.  She was dismissive of Duesler's comments Friday.  \"He knows what happened at the pool that day,\" Wright told CNN in a telephone interview. \"I was embarrassed and humiliated.\"  She called it an \"unfortunate situation,\" adding, \"I know what happened; the members know what happened and a higher power knows what happened.\"  Watch the club president say racism is not at play \u00bb  After news reports of the incident, the office of Sen. Arlen Specter (D-Pennsylvania) said Specter sent a letter to the club president asking him to reinstate the contract with Creative Steps, saying, \"I think that you would agree that there is no place for racism in America today.\"  Duesler said he appreciates the senator's concern, but the club's board has yet to make a decision of how it will proceed.  \"If we're going to revise our policies here, we need to make it so for all the camps,\" he said. \"I just don't think we're prepared for that.\"  Duesler earlier in the week told two Philadelphia television stations the children had changed \"the complexion\" and \"atmosphere\" of the club, a comment that protesters outside the facility Thursday said showed that racism was involved.  Bernice Duesler, John Duesler's wife, called the negative response her husband has faced since the incident \"unbearable.\"  \"He's not one of the good guys -- he's one of the great guys,\" she said, holding back tears. \"He doesn't deserve this.\"  She added, \"If there really was a racial issue that happened, my husband and I would be the first one[s] picketing.\"  Jim Flynn, who said he was one of the club members who made a complaint against the children, told CNN this week it was not racially motivated.  \"There were a lot of children in the pool and not enough lifeguards,\" he said. \"As general members we were not told that they were coming. If we knew, we could decide to not come when the pool was crowded or come anyway. We could have had an option.\"  He also said invitations to two other day care centers, neither of which contained minority children, had previously been withdrawn.

{"article": "JERUSALEM (CNN) -- Israel agreed to release a notorious killer Sunday in order to bring closure to the families of three missing military men, a government spokesman said.  An Israeli woman stands in front of posters of captured soldiers Sunday in Jerusalem.  \"It's not an easy decision,\" Mark Regev told CNN. \"One of the people being released is a brutal murderer, a man that with his own hands killed infants -- a terrible crime, but this is a nasty business.\"  He was referring to Samir Kuntar, the longest-serving Lebanese prisoner in Israel, who is hailed as a hero by Hezbollah.  Kuntar was convicted for a 1979 attack in which he shot and killed an Israeli man in front of his 4-year-old daughter before smashing her head against a rock  and tossing her into the sea.  The victim's 2-year-old daughter was accidentally smothered by her mother, who tried to keep her quiet as they hid from the attackers.  Kuntar was convicted for murdering both children in the attack, which the Palestine Liberation Front orchestrated to protest the signing of the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty at Camp David the previous year.  Kuntar is one of five Lebanese prisoners who Israel will release in exchange for two Israeli soldiers, Ehud \"Udi\" Goldwasser and Eldad Regev.  The Lebanon-based Shiite militant group kindapped the two in a July 2006 raid into northern Israel that left three other Israeli soldiers dead.  Hezbollah never gave Israel any indication whether they survived the attack, which sparked a 34-day war, leaving the families in limbo.  Before the vote, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert told his Cabinet that the two soldiers are not alive, \"as far as we know.\"  \"We'll have a final answer when they are returned,\" Regev said.  Goldwasser and Regev are at the center of the landmark agreement, which has been years in the making, with both sides using the prisoners and intelligence as bartering chips.  Under the deal, which the Cabinet approved 22-3 on Sunday, Hezbollah will also release information about Ron Arad, an Israeli navigator who has been missing since he was forced to eject from his plane over Lebanon in October 1986.  \"We have an obligation, a moral obligation to their families to bring finality,\" Regev said. \"That if they are in fact no longer living, that their families can have a funeral, that they can have a grave, that they can know that this is over.\"  Israel has repeatedly attempted to get information about Arad and other missing airmen by using Lebanese detainees as leverage.  Former Prime Minister Ariel Sharon promised the Arad family that Kuntar will not be released unless Hezbollah provides information on Arad.  In addition to Kuntar and other Lebanese prisoners, Israel will also release Palestinian prisoners and return the remains of dozens of border infiltrators and eight Hezbollah members to Lebanon, according to a statement from the government.  Israel will also provide information to the United Nations about four Iranian diplomats who disappeared in Beirut during the 1982 Israeli invasion, the statement said.  Earlier this month, Israel deported a Lebanese-born man who served six years in jail on charges of spying for Hezbollah.  In exchange, Hezbollah handed over a brown coffin containing the remains of Israeli soldiers killed during the 2006 war. The move was seen as a prelude to a possible prisoner swap between Israel and Hezbollah.

{"article": " -- He had a rough life during the Ice Age, walking around with a couple of broken ribs and a possibly cancerous lesion on his jaw before dying at a young age.  Assistant lab supervisor Trevor Valle discusses the teeth and lower jaw of Columbian mammoth fossil \"Zed.\"  Now, at least 10,000 years later, visitors in Los Angeles can see the remains of \"Zed,\" a Columbian mammoth whose nearly intact skeleton is part of what is being described as a key find by paleontologists at Los Angeles' George C. Page Museum.  Zed was discovered at a construction site in the heart of Los Angeles. An earth mover helping to build an underground parking garage near the L.A. County Museum of Art uncovered the mammoth's skull, according to project director Christopher Shaw.  \"The skull was hit and shaved off... by a scraper,\" Shaw told CNN Thursday. \"We don't know just how smashed up it is, but it's fairly intact because it's a huge jacket we put it around.\"  The mammoth's fossil was found along with 16 other deposits at the site that paleontologists \"tree-boxed\" along with the surrounding dirt, creating 23 massive crates weighing between 5 and 53 tons that were then lifted out intact. Zed's remains were encased in a plaster jacket.  The construction was being monitored by a consulting firm because the site is so close to the La Brea tar pits -- a site that has yielded between 3 million and 4 million fossilized bones.  Construction on the parking garage began in 2006 but it took two more years for all the recovered materials to be handed over to researchers at the Page Museum, who began analyzing the various fossils in June, Shaw said.  \"It's very exciting for us because each one of these... could be different ages in the past 10,000 to 45,000 years,\" Shaw said.  John Harris, the head curator of the Page Museum, publicly announced the finding of \"a whole new treasure trove of fossils\" on Wednesday. He described it as \"the most important discovery\" for the museum \"of the last 90 years.\"  Shaw said the announcement was made to \"create interest\" in the museum's discovery.  Among the most interesting items is likely to be Zed, who is believed to have died in his late 40s. Mammoths are thought to have had an average lifespan of about 60 years.  Not all of Zed's remains have been cleaned off and analyzed.  \"Right now we have opened the plaster jacket of four sections that were excavated, including vertebrae and ribs and pelvis, one tusk and the lower jaw,\" Shaw said. \"It will take another six to 12 months to open everything.\"  Shaw said both of Zed's tusks were found intact, which is very rare.  \"Previously, we've found mammoths but the tusk material was very poorly preserved,\" Shaw said. \"It's very exciting to us to have these two complete, beautifully preserved tusks.\"  The excitement generated by Zed and the rest of the paleontological find could help boost the Page Museum's attendance and funding, which is key as many museums are seeing their attendance dry up during the recession.  \"The cleaning of Zed can be viewed inside the museum inside the 'fishbowl' -- a windowed area -- as parts of his bones are being cleaned,\" Shaw said. \"So people come to see us and we've constructed small exhibits. It will attract a lot of people and that will help our funding situation.\"  Researchers hope to have the entire skeleton on display by next year.  Shaw said it is unique to have such a major fossil find in the heart of an urban center like Los Angeles.  \"I've always said we're kind of spoiled here in Rancho La Brea,\" he said. \"It's not like going to the Gobi Desert where you can't take a shower for weeks.\"  While the process of cleaning and analyzing the fossils is very intricate and time consuming, Shaw said it is a rare experience for researchers to come in to work and not know what they will discover that day.  \"Every day we come to work, we're uncovering things that haven't seen the light of day for 40,000 years,\" he said. \"It's an exciting thing that we're doing just that.\"", "Q": ["Q: What was found at an LA construction site?

{"article": " -- Jon Opsahl said he doesn't think domestic terrorist-turned-housewife Sara Jane Olson served nearly enough time for his mother's murder, but he's relieved the saga ended with Olson's Tuesday release from prison.  Sara Jane Olson was released from a California prison Tuesday after serving seven years.  Olson, a member of the self-styled revolutionary Symbionese Liberation Army -- perhaps best known for kidnapping Patricia Hearst -- was released from a California prison after serving seven years, the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation said.  She was released to her husband just after midnight and is expected to serve her yearlong parole term in Minnesota -- over the the objections of police unions and Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty.  Her sentence stems from her involvement in the 1975 attempted bombings of two police cars and the slaying of Myrna Opsahl during a bank robbery that same year.  Back then, Olson went by her birth name, Kathleen Anne Soliah. After her 1976 indictment in the attempted bombings, she changed her name and started a new life in St. Paul, Minnesota. She was not apprehended until 1999.  \"I've really got nothing to say. She did her time, as minimal as that may have been,\" said Jon Opsahl, who was 15 when his mother was killed. \"One of those years -- just one -- was for the murder of my mom and the bank robbery up in Carmichael.\"  Myrna Opsahl, a mother of four, was depositing money at the Crocker National Bank for her church when she was shot by Olson's co-defendant Emily Montague Harris, according to court documents. Harris was sentenced to eight years; she served four and was released on parole in February 2007.  Jon Opsahl, now 49, said he never understood why it took so long to bring his mother's killers to justice. While charges were filed in the bombings within months, no charges were brought in his mother's murder until 2002.  \"You expect thugs to do what thugs do, but you don't expect the district attorney to turn a blind eye to the murder of an upstanding citizen,\" Jon Opsahl said Monday.  Olson's release Tuesday will cap an oft-strange storyline that spans more than three decades and which saw Olson wear the hats of college student, 1970s radical, housewife and philanthropist.  Attorney Andy Dawkins met Olson, now 62, shortly after she moved to St. Paul through friends in the reggae band, Pressure Drop. Fred Peterson, Olson's husband, played trumpet in the band, Dawkins said.  \"She did good deeds everywhere. She raised three wonderful daughters. It was always a shock to all of us that the Sara we know had that past,\" Dawkins said.  After attending the University of California, Santa Barbara, Olson moved to Berkeley in the early 1970s. There, she met Angela Atwood in 1972, and the two became best friends and roommates, Olson told L.A. Weekly in a 2002 interview shortly before she was imprisoned.  After Atwood and five other SLA members were killed in a 1974 gunfight with the Los Angeles Police Department, Olson appeared at a memorial in Berkeley's Ho Chi Minh Park to eulogize her friend.  \"SLA soldiers, although I know it's not necessary to say, keep fighting. I'm with you, and we are with you,\" Olson told the crowd.  Almost a year later, Olson took part in two bank robberies to help fund the SLA, according to court documents. During the Carmichael robbery, Olson \"entered the bank with a firearm and kicked a nonresisting pregnant teller in the stomach. The teller miscarried after the robbery,\" the documents said.  In August 1975, Los Angeles police found homemade bombs under two squad cars. They were designed to explode when the car moved, but neither device detonated.  Authorities cast the attempted bombings as payback for the bloody shootout that left Atwood and other SLA members dead.  A probe into the gunbattle helped police arrest Hearst, the granddaughter of publishing mogul William Randolph Hearst, who claimed she had been kidnapped, raped and brainwashed by the SLA.  In her book \"Every Secret Thing,\" Hearst put Olson at the center of the Carmichael robbery.  Olson soon left California. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, \"she evaded capture for 23 years, and in the meantime, became a doctor's wife, mother of three, community volunteer, veteran of charity work in Africa and practicing Methodist living in an upscale neighborhood in St. Paul.\"  Though authorities said a 1999 \"America's Most Wanted\" episode marking the 25th anniversary of the L.A. shootout led to Olson's arrest, the show's Web site mentions neither Olson nor Soliah among its almost 1,100 \"captures.\"  Her Minnesota friends and neighbors were shocked, even incredulous, when she was arrested. They pleaded with a judge to grant her bail. The Sara Olson Defense Fund began selling cookbooks, titled, \"Serving Time: America's Most Wanted Recipes.\"  It would help that Olson was generous with her time. She was active in the church. She volunteered for political campaigns. Dawkins said he had a blind client to whom she used to read The New York Times.  Olson's philanthropy, coupled with the connections of her husband, a respected emergency room doctor, made raising the $1 million bail relatively easy, said Dawkins, who remembers that some members of the community had so much faith in Olson they put up their children's college funds.  On October 31, 2001, Olson pleaded guilty to two counts of attempting to ignite a destructive device or explosive.  She later tried to rescind the plea, saying \"cowardice\" prevented her from telling the truth. A superior court judge, however, denied her request and in January 2002 sentenced her to 20 years to life in prison, a sentence the parole board later reduced.  Olson was charged with Opsahl's slaying that same week and pleaded guilty in 2003 to second-degree murder. Olson received a sentence of five years to life.  The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation said in a statement that Olson's sentence was reduced for good behavior and for her work on a maintenance crew that cleaned the main yard of the Central California Women's Facility in Chowchilla.  Dawkins said \"it's right\" that Olson served time, but he is glad she is being released. He expects many hugs await her in St. Paul and that she will soon be back to her generous ways.  \"I really believe who we knew in St. Paul was the true Sara Olson,\" he said.  The Los Angeles Police Protection League disagrees and has loudly opposed her early release. Sgt. Paul Weber, the league's chief, called her a sociopath who \"never said she was sorry.\" He also lashed out at those who rush to defend her.  \"Enough with the BS that she was unfairly targeted by law enforcement for her youthful indiscretions -- she is a criminal,\" Weber said in a Monday statement.  Corrections officials say it's important that she be reunited with her family during her parole -- it helps reduce recidivism -- but Minnesota legislators, the governor and the St. Paul Police Federation have asked Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger to keep her in California over the next year.  \"Letting a domestic terrorist like Kathleen Soliah set the terms of her parole is an insult to the memory of Myrna Opsahl and all the men and women of LAPD past and present,\" the St. Paul union said in a letter last week.  Jon Opsahl, however, just wants to put Olson out of his mind.  \"Get her out of here,\" he said. \"I don't want to see or think about her again.\"", "Q": ["Q: Who opposes Olson?

{"article": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- North Korea has positioned what is thought to be a long-range missile on its launch pad, a U.S. counter-proliferation official said on Wednesday.  A North Korean soldier stands guard in the border village of Panmunjom on December 1, 2004 in South Korea.  The official confirmed a Japanese media report.  North Korea recently informed a pair of U.N. agencies that it plans to launch a satellite. The launch is slated for sometime between April 4-8, according to Yonhap, South Korea's state-sponsored news agency.  North Korea is technically capable of launching a rocket in as little as two to four days, according to Kim Taewoo, an expert at the Korea Institute for Defense Analyses, but who doubts a launch will come that soon.  It would not make sense for Pyongyang to make such a move after going through official channels with its plans, Kim said.  \"The North could delay the launch if they experience problems with the weather, or within the leadership, but I don't see any reason why they would fire it ahead of time,\" Kim said.  North Korea's announcement has triggered international consternation. U.S. and South Korean officials have long said the North is actually preparing to test-fire a long-range missile under the guise of a satellite launch.  Watch what might motivate Pyongyang to pursue missile tests \u00bb  Japan said this month that it could shoot down the satellite that North Korean officials said they plan to launch. What the North Koreans would be testing may not be known until an actual launch.  A U.N. Security Council resolution in 2006 banned North Korea from conducting ballistic missile activity. Japanese officials said they could shoot down the object whether it is a missile or a satellite.  \"As the U.N. resolutions prohibit (North Korea) from engaging in ballistic missile activities, we still consider it to be a violation of a technical aspect, even if (the North) claims it is a satellite. We will discuss the matter with related countries based on this view,\" Japanese Foreign Minister Hirofumi Nakasone said this month.  The United States has no plans to shoot down the North Korean rocket, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Wednesday, but will raise the issue with the U.N. Security Council if Pyongyang carries out a launch.  \"We are doing our best to dissuade the North Koreans from going forward, because it is provocative action,\" Clinton said. \"It raises questions about their compliance with the Security Council Resolution 1718. And if they persist and go forward, we will take it up in appropriate channels.\"  South Korea echoed Clinton's statements.  \"The South Korean government believes that if the North conducts its launch despite continuous warnings of the South Korean government and the international community, it is a provocative action that constitutes a serious threat to the security of northeast Asia and the Korean peninsula,\" said Foreign Ministry spokesman Moon Tae-Young.  \"The launching of the long-range rocket is a clear violation of the U.N. Security Council Resolution No. 1718, and we strongly urge North Korea to immediately stop such measures.\"  The North Korean Taepodong-2 missile is thought to have an intended range of about 4,200 miles (6,700 kilometers) that -- if true -- could strike Alaska or Hawaii.", "Q": ["Q: who has no plans to shoot rocket down?

A woman playing the role of a high priestess lit the flame by sunlight focused on a mirror, the only way by tradition it can be lit.  That fire then was used to light the Vancouver Olympic Torch, which Greek skier and three-time Olympian Vassilis Dimitriadis then carried on the first leg of its journey through Greece.  \"The Olympic torch and flame are the symbols of the values and ideals which lie at the heart of the Olympic Games,\" International Olympic Committee President Jacques Rogge said before the ceremony.  The torch will carry a message of peace throughout the world, he said -- words echoed by Vancouver 2010 Chief Executive John Furlong.  \"Today we build a bridge between ancient Olympia and young Canada,\" he said. \"Canada is a country with a welcoming spirit and a glowing heart.... We will do all we can to be a shining example of the ideas and values that were first kindled here in this hallowed place.\"  After its 1,351-mile (2,180-kilometer) trip through Greece, the torch will be taken to Canada. On October 30, the first of 12,000 torchbearers will begin carrying it through Canada on what will be a 106-day, 27,900-mile (45,000-kilometer) relay.  \"It will be the longest domestic relay in Olympic history, just to be sure every Canadian will be given the right to dream and celebrate,\" Furlong said.  The torch relay is derived from ancient rituals in Olympia, where torch and relay races were popular festival events and where heralds traveled throughout Greece to announce the games.  The torch for the 2010 Winter Games was designed by transportation and aerospace company Bombardier, a Vancouver Olympic sponsor. The lean curves of the white torch were inspired by the lines carved in the snow by winter sports and by the \"undulating beauty of the Canadian landscape,\" the company said.  The torch's special construction will allow it to burn through a range of winter weather, including snow, rain, sleet, wind and subzero temperatures, Bombardier said. It weighs 3.5 pounds (1.6 kilograms) fully fueled, the company said.  The flame is due to arrive in Vancouver, British Columbia, on February 12 when the opening ceremony of the 2010 Winter Games will be held at the domed BC Place Stadium.", "Q": ["Q: How many days is the relay through Canada?

{"article": " -- Saudi Arabia's Interior Ministry has identified the suicide bomber who attempted to assassinate the country's assistant interior minister last Thursday and released details of a phone conversation between the two men prior to the attack.  A Saudi man reads a newspaper featuring a front-page story on Thursday's attack.  The disclosures reported by the country's official news agency were highly unusual.  The agency, SPA, reported the attacker, Abdullah Hassan Talea' Asiri, a wanted Saudi militant who had been hiding in Yemen, got in touch with Saudi authorities telling them he wanted to turn himself in to Saudi Prince Mohammed bin Naif, the assistant minister of Interior for Security Affairs.  After arriving back in Saudi Arabia, Asiri spoke by phone to Mohammed, who agreed to see him during a Ramadan reception at his home in the city of Jeddah.  According to a transcript provided by SPA, during the phone call the men exchanged greetings and discussed the importance of the holy month of Ramadan.  Mohammed is quoted as telling Asiri that \"one should be careful; evil people would like to exploit all of you. Now only you to fear Allah Almighty and come home.\" Later in the conversation, Asiri asked if a special plane could be dispatched to take him to meet with Mohammed.  Asiri, escorted by security, was transported to Jeddah, where he met with the prince at his palace. During the meeting, Asiri explained to Mohammed that other Saudi militants in Yemen also wished to surrender but sought reassurances from the prince.  According to SPA, a call was then placed to one of the militants in Yemen. While the prince was on the phone, Asiri blew himself up, SPA reported.  Mohammed, who is also the son of the country's Interior Minister, was lightly injured in the attack.  Saudi King Abdullah was shown visiting the prince in the hospital after the attack on Saudi TV. The king asked the prince why the militant was allowed to get so close him without being inspected properly and searched thoroughly. Prince Mohammed answered the king by telling him it had been a mistake.  SPA adds that \"the concerned security authorities opened an investigation into the incident. However, the criminal laboratory and a forensic report have reached conclusions that, for security considerations, will not be announced at this time.\"  Asiri's name was on a list of 85 most wanted suspects released by Saudi Arabia in February. At the time the list was released, Saudi Arabia asked Interpol for its help in apprehending dozens of the wanted Saudis on the list who were suspected of plotting attacks against Saudi Arabia from abroad. The announcement was significant because it is rare for the kingdom to announce that some of its most wanted terrorists are on the loose. It is also unusual for Saudi Arabia to ask for help in finding them.  Some of the suspects on the most wanted list had been released from Guantanamo Bay, returned to Saudi Arabia, and had then gone through a Jihadi reeducation program run by the Interior Ministry, before fleeing to Yemen and taking up terrorist activity once more.  Saudi Arabia has been battling terrorism since 2003, when al Qaeda launched a series of attacks inside the Kingdom. In the security crackdown that followed, Asiri, like many other wanted Saudi militants, fled to Yemen.  Earlier this year, Saudi al Qaeda and Yemeni al Qaeda merged to form \"Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.\"  Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which operates out of Yemen, claimed responsibility earlier this week for the attack against Mohammed. In August, Saudi Arabia's Interior Ministry announced that over the past year, 44 al Qaeda suspects across the country had been arrested.  While the Interior Ministry is calling the attempted assassination an \"action of treachery and treason\", SPA reports that the Ministry will not change its \"open-door policy\" of granting amnesty to militants wishing to surrender - in particular, \"those citizens residing outside the country\" who wish to \"take advantage of the state-sponsored program of advice and care.\"", "Q": ["Q: Who wanted to surrender?

{"article": " -- Pope Benedict XVI refused Wednesday to soften the Vatican's ban on condom use as he arrived in Africa for his first visit to the continent as pope.  Cameroonian President Paul Biya, left, walks with Pope Benedict XVI at the airport in Yaounde, Tuesday.  He landed in Cameroon, the first stop on a trip that will also take him to Angola.  Sub-Saharan Africa has been hit harder by AIDS and HIV than any other region of the world, according to the United Nations and World Health Organization. There has been fierce debate between those who advocate the use of condoms to help stop the spread of the epidemic and those who oppose it.  The pontiff reiterated the Vatican's policy on condom use as he flew from Rome to Yaounde, the capital of Cameroon, CNN Vatican analyst John Allen said.  Pope Benedict has always made it clear he intends to uphold the traditional Catholic teaching on artificial contraception -- a \"clear moral prohibition\" -- Allen said. But his remarks Tuesday were among the first times he stated the policy explicitly since he became pope nearly four years ago.  He has, however, assembled a panel of scientists and theologians to consider the narrow question of whether to allow condoms for married couples, one of whom has HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.  It is still not clear how the pope will rule on the matter, said Allen, who is also a senior correspondent for the National Catholic Reporter.  The Catholic Church has long been on the front line of HIV care, he said, adding that it is probably the largest private provider of HIV care in the world.  More than 22 million people in sub-Saharan Africa are infected with HIV, according to a 2008 UNAIDS/WHO report. Nine out of 10 children with HIV in the world live in the region, which has 11.4 million orphans because of AIDS, the report said, and 1.5 million people there died of the disease in 2007.", "Q": ["Q: What made him choose Cameroon?

{"article": "BOGOTA, Colombia (CNN) -- Colombian police have killed a drug trafficker who the government says is one of the most sought-after fugitive outside the country's rebel leaders.  Victor Manuel Mejia Munera was a drug lord with ties to paramilitary groups, the Colombian government says.  Victor Manuel Mejia Munera and two bodyguards were killed Tuesday when police tracked them down on a farm in the northwestern province of Antioquia, according to a statement on the Colombian presidency Web site.  Three people also were arrested, according to the statement.  Mejia Munera was wearing an American-style, desert-camouflage uniform when he was killed, said Colombian Defense Minister Juan Manuel Santos. Mejia Munera also had short- and long-range weapons with ammunition, the presidential statement said.  \"This is a great strike of the Public Force against the criminal structures of the country,\" Santos said, warning that drug traffickers who do not turn themselves over to the government will \"end up in the jail or in a tomb.\"  In terms of the country's most-wanted list, Mejia Munera was one of Colombia's most sought-after criminals and ranked just below the leaders of Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, the statement said.  The leftist guerilla group, which goes by its Spanish acronym FARC, holds about 750 hostages in the jungles of Colombia and has justified hostage-taking as a legitimate military tactic in a long-running civil war involving government forces, drug traffickers and right-wing paramilitaries.  Mejia Munera is not alleged to have ties to FARC, but he had been involved with a right-wing paramilitary group known as United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia, according to the U.S. State Department.  Mejia Munera and his brother, Miguel Angel Mejia Munera, known as \"Los Mellizos,\" or \"the Twins,\" have been accused of running major drug rings in Colombia. The brothers also have faced narcotics-trafficking charges in the United States.  Santos initially told reporters that police had killed Miguel Angel Mejia Munera. The Colombian presidency later said the slain drug lord was actually Victor Manuel Mejia Munera.  Fingerprints confirmed that the dead man was Victor Mejia Munera, Colombian-based Caracol Radio reported. The brothers sometimes exchanged identities, the radio station said, and identity documents belonging to Miguel Mejia Munera were found near Victor Mejia Munera.  In 2004, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia indicted the twins on narcotics-trafficking charges.  The U.S. Justice Department at one point offered a $5 million reward for \"true and effective information\" on the whereabouts of a dozen suspects it wanted extradited to the United States.  One of the 12 men wanted was Miguel Mejia Munera. The State Department said Wednesday there was no reward for Victor Mejia Munera.  The U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control reported that the brothers have been involved in narcotics trafficking since the early 1990s, when they were guarding ships carrying cocaine from western Colombia to Mexico.  \"Over time,\" OFAC said in a news release last year, the brothers \"rose through the ranks to lead their own narcotics trafficking organization.\"  \"Recent reports indicate that Los Mellizos may be funding their own illegal armed groups to facilitate their narcotics trafficking activities,\" the release said.  The Colombian prosecutor general's office had indicted Victor Mejia Munera for his role in a 2004 paramilitary massacre of 11 farmers in Tame in the eastern Colombian province of Arauca, according to the State Department.

{"article": "(Entertainment Weekly) -- Fueled by a hefty dose of tweener love, Zac Efron's \"17 Again\" won this weekend's box office sweepstakes without breaking a sweat.  Zac Efron stars in \"17 Again,\" which debuted in the No. 1 slot at the box office.  The high school time-warp comedy, which costars Matthew Perry and Leslie Mann, earned $24.1 million, according to studio estimates from the box office tracking firm Nielsen EDI.  The film's haul marked another No. 1 debut for Efron, who helped boost ticket sales with an appearance this weekend on Saturday Night Live.  In 2007, the musical \"Hairspray,\" which co-starred Efron, opened first at $27.5 million. Last year, Efron's \"High School Musical 3: Senior Year\" bowed with $42 million, and while \"17 Again\" may have fallen short of that mark, it still represents an auspicious maiden voyage for Efron's post-Disney career.  Despite the raft of critics who pooh-poohed the film, which received a 61 percent fresh rating on Rottentomatoes.com, audiences were more favorably inclined, giving it a strong A- CinemaScore.  Landing at No. 2, the Russell Crowe-Ben Affleck thriller \"State of Play\" pulled in $14.1 million. The film, which garnered generally positive reviews, is the latest of a string of adult-oriented dramas to lag at the box office, although its final tally actually came in somewhat higher than anticipated and was an improvement over the $12.9 million opening for Crowe's last outing, last fall's \"Body of Lies.\" While \"17 Again\" mopped up moviegoers on the younger end of the age spectrum, a whopping 75 percent of \"State of Play's\" audience was over 35.  Holding steady at No. 3 for the second week in a row, \"Monsters vs. Aliens\" took in another $12.9 million. The film's impressive performance in its fourth weekend brings the grand total for the animated kiddie flick to $162 million the highest this year by a wide margin.  \"Hannah Montana: The Movie\" dropped 61 percent from its opening last weekend, but the Miley Cyrus starrer still proved strong enough for the No. 4 spot with $12.7 million, boosting its cumulative gross to $56.2 million.  Rounding out the top five, \"Fast & Furious\" still had plenty of gas in the tank, earning $12.3 million in its third weekend for an overall cume of $136.7 million. The same, however, can't be said for the Jason Statham action flick \"Crank High Voltage,\" which sputtered into a distant sixth place with a decidedly low-voltage $6.5 million.

{"article": "Buenos Aires, Argentina (CNN) -- Marianela Galli waited 34 years for the men who killed her family to be punished. On Wednesday night, inside a packed courtroom in downtown Buenos Aires, she learned their fates.  \"We have justice and these people are going to jail and I can finally walk in the streets without them,\" she said.  Sixteen former Argentine military officers received sentences ranging from 18 years to life in prison for their roles in human rights abuses committed during Argentina's 1976 to 1983 dictatorship. The bloody era, when the military used kidnapping, torture and murder to silence dissidents, became known as the \"Dirty War.\" The seven-year junta claimed an estimated 30,000 lives.  Galli's parents and grandmother were among the victims.  On June 12, 1977, 16-month-old Marianela, her mother, Patricia, her father, Mario, and her grandmother, Violeta, were kidnapped from their home in Buenos Aires. They were taken to the Argentine Naval Mechanics School, known as ESMA, the largest and most notorious of dozens of detention centers operated by the Argentine military at that time.  After three days in captivity, the military released Galli and gave her to her father's family. Her parents and grandmother remained inside the ESMA, where they endured two months of torture before being drugged and then thrown alive from an airplane into the chilly waters of the South Atlantic.  Thousands perished in the weekly Wednesday \"death flights,\" and most of their bodies were never recovered.  \"I don't have my parents with me. I don't have my grandmother with me. They changed my life against my will and there is nothing I can do about it,\" she said.  Marianela Galli\u00c2\u00b4s story is remarkable, but it is not unique. Five-thousand people passed through the white-washed walls of the ESMA. Most were never seen again.  The conclusion of the two-year ESMA trial on Wednesday night provided a sense of closure for victims' family members and friends, thousands of whom braved chilly spring temperatures outside the courthouse to watch a judge read the sentences on a big-screen television.  \"This trial took many years to happen, but thankfully our former president, Nestor Kirchner, embraced the human rights cause. That is why we are here today,\" said Tati Almeida, a member of the human rights groups Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo, whose son, Alejandro, was \"disappeared\" by the military.  The silent marches staged by victims' mothers and grandmothers first brought the world's attention to the atrocities taking place in Argentina in the late 1970s. They have continued their efforts to seek justice for the victims ever since.  \"This is a very emotional moment for me. It will take me several days to process it. Because from the first accounts I gave years ago up until now, repeatedly testifying and testifying, we now finally have the first sentences,\" said Munu Actis, a survivor of the ESMA detention center.  As Judge Daniel Obligado read out the sentences, the loudest jeers were reserved for Alfredo Astiz, a former Navy captain whose boyish looks and deceitful ways earned him the nickname the \"Blonde Angel of Death.\"  Astiz worked as a Navy spy, gaining the trust of human rights activists and then choosing which ones to target for disappearance. Astiz has been unrepentant for his actions, saying he was simply following orders.  \"This is not justice, this is a lynching,\" he said shortly before his sentencing.  Astiz received a life sentence for his role in the deaths of renowned Argentine writer and journalist Rodolfo Walsh, French nuns Alice Domon and Leonie Duquet, and Azucena Villaflor, one of the founders of the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo.  Mario Galli, Marianela Galli's father, had come up in the naval ranks together with Astiz before deciding to leave the military because of their increasingly violent tactics. It was a decision that ultimately cost him his life.  A French court sentenced Astiz to life in prison in 1990 for the kidnapping and killing of two French nuns. But he remained free for more than a decade. For many years, an amnesty law in Argentina giving former military officials immunity from prosecution over human rights abuses protected him.  Galli recalls seeing him one night in 1998 when she was working as a waitress at a Buenos Aires restaurant. Astiz walked in at 1 a.m. and ordered a coffee.  \"I felt absolutely helpless when I saw him. I couldn't believe that this man who had helped kill my parents was allowed to be free,\" she said.  The ESMA trial was just one of many taking place in Argentina. Amnesty laws protecting former military officers were stripped in 2005 under the leadership of the late president Nestor Kirchner.  His wife and successor, Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, has also been a vocal proponent of putting former officers on trial. This human rights initiative has helped bolster support for Fernandez, who was re-elected to a four-year term on October 23rd with 54 percent of the vote.  \"The Kirchners are the ones who have made these trials happen, and I am eternally grateful to them for it,\" Jorge Morresi said after the sentencing on Wednesday. His cousin was \"disappeared\" in 1977.  The sentencing of the officers took more than one hour to read. When it was finished, thousands outside the courthouse hugged, cried, danced and sang.  As she embraced her aunt, Monica, who raised her following her parents' death, Marianela Galli reflected on the historic day that she had long hoped would arrive.  \"This is a different kind of sensation. I am sad, and very happy because justice is coming, finally,\" she said.", "Q": ["Q: How many military officers were sentenced? A:", "Q: Who was known as the blonde angel of death?

{"article": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A federal judge has ordered the immediate release into the United States of 17 Chinese Muslims who have been held for several years in the U.S. military facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.  A guard tower is visible behind razor wire at the military facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.  U.S. District Judge Ricardo Urbina on Tuesday ordered the 17 detainees to appear in his Washington courtroom at 10 a.m. Friday and said he would hold a hearing next week to determine under what conditions they will be settled in the United States.  The government late Tuesday afternoon announced it would file papers shortly with an appeals court seeking an emergency stay to stop the judge's order in its tracks.  The detainees are ethnic Uighurs, from a mostly Muslim autonomous region in western China.  They have been in government custody for seven years and have been cleared for release for the past four years to any country willing to take them. No countries have volunteered.  The judge, visibly impatient, told government lawyers he wants no delays.  \"There is a pressing need for them to be released,\" Urbina declared.  When a government lawyer requested one week for authorities to determine how immigration authorities would handle a court-ordered arrival of individuals with no status, Urbina summarily rejected the request.  He angrily demanded Immigration and Customs officials not even consider arresting the Uighurs upon arrival.  \"I have issued an order. I do not want these people interfered with in any way,\" the judge said.  Justice Department lawyers told the judge they will immediately appeal the ruling and seek a stay of the order with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.  The Justice Department released a statement late Tuesday afternoon protesting Urbina's order.   \"Today's ruling presents serious national security and separation of powers concerns and raises unprecedented legal issues,\" said Justice Department chief spokesman Brian Roehrkasse.  At the White House, Press Secretary Dana Perino warned the ruling represents a dangerous precedent.  \"The district court's ruling, if allowed to stand, could be used as precedent for other detainees held at Guantanamo Bay, including sworn enemies of the United States suspected of planning the attacks of 9/11 who may also seek release into our country,\" she said.  Dozens of colorfully dressed members of the Uighur community from the Washington area beamed as they left the courtroom and began embracing.  \"We welcome this. It has been a very long time,\" said Amy Reger of the Uyghur Human Rights Project.  The United States determined in 2004 the 17 Uighurs are not enemy combatants, but has kept them at Guantanamo while trying to persuade other countries to resettle them. Officials said they were not returned to China because of credible fears they could be mistreated if returned.  The Uighurs fled Afghanistan shortly after the U.S.-led bombing campaign began in 2001. They were turned over to U.S. military officials by Pakistani authorities.  U.S. intelligence officials alleged the Uighur detainees are associated with the East Turkmenistan Islamist Movement, which the administration designated a terrorist organization in 2002. Lawyers for the Uighurs dispute any terrorist connections.  Attorneys for the 17 detainees promised the court that if the judge's ruling stands, a Lutheran church group in Maryland and other service groups are prepared to provide both short-term and long-term care and support for the freed prisoners. Seventeen Uighur homes have been identified to initially house the detainees.  Urbina scheduled an October 16 hearing for immigration officials and other government agencies to discuss conditions for the 17 men.", "Q": ["Q: What wil the federal government do?

{"article": " -- She's been a comedian, talk-show host and feared red carpet fashion critic. Now you can add winner of \"The Celebrity Apprentice\" to Joan Rivers' lengthy resume.  Donald Trump and Joan Rivers attend \"The Celebrity Apprentice\" season finale Sunday in New York.  After weeks of competition, the 75-year-old dynamo beat out 15 other contestants, including Dennis Rodman, Tom Green and Brian McKnight, to take the top spot in this season's edition of the reality show hosted by Donald Trump.  Rivers went up against poker champion Annie Duke in Sunday night's finale in which both women were charged with planning a VIP party and silent auction for the last and deciding task.  \"They're both tough, they're both smart and they both hate each other,\" Trump observed at the beginning of the show.  The apparent tension between Rivers and Duke continued in the final boardroom, part of which played out in front of a live audience, with both finalists bickering and interrupting each other repeatedly as Trump looked on.  In the end, Duke raised far more money at her event, but Rivers was able to attract more celebrities and provide a better overall experience for the guests at her party, and Trump declared her the winner of the competition.  \"Your level of energy has been amazing,\" he told Rivers.  The victory means $250,000 for Rivers' charity: God's Love We Deliver.  If the series thrives on conflict, it got plenty of mileage out of Rivers. She blew up at country singer Clint Black, referred to another contestant as a \"stupid blonde\" and smashed a champagne glass out of frustration at one point.  But Rivers seemed to be especially infuriated by Duke, calling her a \"despicable human being\" -- the tamest of the insults she hurled in Duke's direction over the course of the series.  Rivers even walked out in a huff after her daughter, and fellow contestant, Melissa was fired from the show. The exit, complete with bleeped obscenities, was turned into a cliffhanger of sorts when it seemed like Rivers might not come back, but she returned to the show for the next task.  You might think a show that's best known for the phrase \"You're fired\" might not do so well in a bad economy when thousands of people have heard similar words for real at their workplaces, but the series averaged more than 8 million viewers a week, according to Entertainment Weekly. EW: Did the right one win?  Revived formula  \"The Apprentice\" made a splash when it debuted in 2004, making a reality television star out of Trump and contestants such as Omarosa Manigault-Stallworth. For several seasons, the series took ambitious young mogul wannabes, divided them into teams and had them compete in tasks that ranged from selling lemonade to creating advertising campaigns for major corporations.  The contestants vied for the chance to run one of Trump's companies for a year, and Trump fired someone from the losing team each week until he selected an apprentice. Over the years, ratings for the show gradually declined, but the formula was revived in early 2008 with the first season of \"The Celebrity Apprentice.\"  The tasks, pressure-cooker atmosphere and boardroom bickering stayed the same, but the competition now featured contestants with varying degrees of fame and focused on raising money for charity.  The first \"Celebrity Apprentice\" top spot went to Piers Morgan, the prickly judge on \"Britain's Got Talent\" who made news this spring when he invited singing sensation Susan Boyle to dinner after her memorable performance on the show.  Morgan also made several appearances on this season's \"Apprentice,\" sitting in as Trump's \"eyes and ears\" during one episode and interviewing the final four candidates in another.  Morgan's aggressive questioning seemed to annoy the celebrities, especially Jesse James, who glared icily at Morgan when he kept asking him why he did not turn to his wife, Sandra Bullock, for help in raising money during the various tasks.  Perhaps Bullock might be tempted to try competing on the show herself.  NBC announced last month it is bringing back \"The Celebrity Apprentice\" for another installment in the spring of 2010, Entertainment Weekly reported.", "Q": ["Q: Who will she play in the final?

{"article": "NEW YORK (CNN) -- Ariel Binns is cute, smart, outgoing and looks remarkably like first daughter Sasha Obama.  Young model Ariel Binns, right, resembles Sasha Obama.  The similarity has not gone unnoticed by the fashion industry. Harper's Bazaar magazine cast the 6-year-old Brooklyn, New York, first-grader with model Tyra Banks in a photo spread showing an African-American family in the White House.  Binns, a child model, was peering out from under a big wooden desk in an image reminiscent of John F. Kennedy's time in office.  When it comes to fashion there's nothing like a powerful brand to boost sales, especially if that brand is a dynamic first family.  \"Marketers are finally waking up to it -- you know -- black is beautiful,\" says global branding expert David Rogers who predicts African-American models will play a more prominent role in fashion photography as a direct result of the Obamas. \"It's just going to become part of the fabric of the fashion imagery of pop culture, which is a great thing,\" says Rogers.  Watch young first daughter look-alike model \u00bb  At Wilhelmina Kids, a modeling agency in New York for kids and teens, agents say there is increased demand for first daughter look-alikes.  \"It's a trend because, what little girl doesn't want to emulate the first kids?\" said Marlene Wallach, president of Wilhelmina, which represents Binns.  Unlike the Bush twins or Chelsea Clinton, global branding experts say the appeal of the Obama girls is unique -- and infinitely marketable. After the first kids appeared in their J.Crew outfits on Inauguration Day, the company's Web site got so many hits, it crashed.  \"The most visible, most exciting family in America is this beautiful black family and so people are ready and looking for those kinds of images,\" says branding expert David Rogers, adding that a lot of Americans want to identify and, \"find some sort of connection with this family.\"  There is a downside. The Obamas were not happy when toy manufacturer Ty Inc. came out with African-American dolls named Sweet Sasha and Marvelous Malia even though the company said the dolls did not look like the Obama girls. First lady Michelle Obama's office said it was \"inappropriate to use young private citizens for marketing purposes.\"  New York  clinical psychologist Judy Kuriansky says many famous families face similar problems.  \"I can certainly understand Michelle Obama being protective of her children. Many celebrities in Hollywood feel that way too. They don't want their children exposed to the public, because once the child is exposed to the public image, not only are they owned, but they could be used in many different ways and it takes away from the child growing up as a normal, average child.\"  Still, some say the celebrity of Sasha and Malia has a positive effect by presenting a positive and prominent image of young African-American girls.  Asked whether she believes the Obama girls will open up possibilities for her own child, Ariel Binns' mom Dawn Crooks says, \"I think it will. I hope it does.\"  As for the overall effect, branding expert Rogers says he believes using look-alikes will take diversity to a whole new level.", "Q": ["Q: What are they waking up to?

{"article": "Washington (CNN) -- Senate Democrats proposed Friday tax incentives for businesses hiring veterans as well as job training for all service members leaving the military.  The measure was unveiled as the next piece in President Obama's jobs bill and as a remedy to unemployment among veterans.  \"It would basically make sure that our veterans are not standing at the back of any unemployment line,\" Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Michigan) told reporters. \"It's important that we support our troops not just by lip-service but by action, and we intend to act next week.\"  Noticeable absent from Friday's Democratic proposal is the job bill's controversial millionaire's surtax, which would increases taxes on those with incomes of more than $1 million.  Republicans have roundly rejected the surtax, saying it would hurt small businesses and stunt economic growth.  Sen. Patty Murray (D-Washington), chairwoman of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, told reporters they would utilize \"existing pay-fors,\" or revenue streams, that have been used to fund veterans' issues.  \"What we did is bring together Republican and Democrat, House and Senate, congressional and administration ideas in putting this package forward. I think it uses the best of everyone's ideas and will make a real difference for veterans,\" said Murray. \"Veterans are not a partisan issue. They are something we can all get behind.\"  A major component of the bill would offer tax credits to companies hiring jobless veterans -- up to $2,400 in credits for hiring veterans out of work for more than 4 weeks, up to $5,600 for hiring veterans out of work for more than six months, and up to $9,600 credit for employing veterans with service-connected disabilities looking for work for more than six months.  The bill would also make mandatory jobs skills training for every service member moving into civilian life and also offer older veterans additional Montgomery GI benefits for training programs at community colleges and technical schools.  \"It is quite frankly shameful that veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan have a higher unemployment rate than the rest of America,\" said Sen. Jon Tester (D-Montana).  A cost estimate for the bill was not immediately available. Murray said Democrats plan to attach the veterans' measure as an amendment to House-passed bill that eliminates the 3% withholding requirement for government contractors -- a bill that House and Senate Republicans say would create jobs.  While Senate Republican aides indicated the veterans' assistance proposal and the absence of the millionaire's surtax were encouraging, they were cautious and said they would need to see the proposal's details, including how it would be funded.

{"article": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The United States has designated a Kurdish militant group in Turkey as a terrorist organization, the State Department said.  Turkish President Abdullah Gul, left, speaks to reporters with President Bush earlier this week in Washington.  The group, the Kurdistan Freedom Falcons, known as TAK, is affiliated with the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK -- the separatist Kurdish group that has been attacking Turkey from inside northern Iraq.  Turkey has responded to the attacks by bombing PKK targets in the predominantly Kurdish area of northern Iraq. The United States, the European Union and Turkey regard the group as a terrorist organization.  The United States says TAK is \"responsible for multiple terrorist attacks in Turkey, which targeted tourist locations, military sites, and government buildings, resulting in several deaths.\"  The classification of the group as a \"Specially Designated Global Terrorist\"  subjects the organization and its supporters to financial sanctions.  \"With this designation, the United States reaffirms its commitment to fight terrorism in cooperation with its NATO ally, Turkey. The United States will continue to work with Turkey, Iraq, and the rest of Europe against the PKK and its support networks and affiliates, such as the TAK. There must be no safe havens for such terrorists,\" according to a statement from Tom Casey, deputy spokesman of the State Department.

{"article": "BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN)  -- The office of Muqtada al-Sadr accused Iraqi and U.S. forces of attacking Sadr City on Friday, just hours after the Shiite cleric called for calm in the wake of the assassination of one of his top aides in the southern city of Najaf.  Iraqi Sadrists march Friday in the Najaf funeral procession of Sayyed Riyadh al-Nuri, top aide to Muqtada al-Sadr.  Witnesses and media in the heavily Shiite Baghdad neighborhood of Sadr City, home to the cleric's power base in the capital, reported heavy fighting between U.S.-backed Iraqi troops and al-Sadr's Mehdi Army militia.  The witnesses said U.S. aircraft had been bombarding the area for hours, and media reported rockets slamming into houses and many casualties.  Witnesses and al-Sadr's office said mosques were making loudspeaker announcements about Mehdi Army attacks on U.S. military armored vehicles.  U.S. troops working in support of Iraqi soldiers killed two snipers, two other men firing rocket-propelled grenades and \"multiple others from a nearby building where soldiers were taking RPG and machine gun fire,\" the U.S. military said in a statement.  At the same time -- about 9 p.m. -- at least six roadside bombs damaged vehicles in a U.S. Army convoy that was transporting barriers for a group of Iraqi Army soldiers establishing a checkpoint, the military said.  Afterward, the military said, the Iraqi and U.S. soldiers were attacked by small-arms, machine-gun and RPG fire from buildings overlooking the road.  The soldiers fired back at their attackers, killing at least four of them.  More explosions from the buildings indicated possible arms and munitions stored there, the military said. But the small-arms attack continued until the U.S. forces fired two rounds from an M1A2 Abrams tank, killing two more attackers.  Not long afterward, the U.S. Air Force, operating an unmanned aerial vehicle, fired a Hellfire missile at three men spotted setting roadside bombs, killing all three.  Maj. John Gossart, executive officer of the American unit involved, said that no U.S. or Iraqi troops were seriously hurt.  Earlier, al-Sadr issued remarks about the killing of Sayyed Riyadh al-Nuri, who was shot outside his house in Najaf's Adala neighborhood after returning from Friday prayers.  \"The hands of the occupiers and their collaborators have treacherously reached our beloved martyr Sayyed Riyadh al-Nuri,\" al-Sadr wrote in a statement on the Web.  Al-Nuri is one of 17 people killed over 24 hours in airstrikes, fighting and attacks in areas wracked in recent weeks by fighting among Shiites.  The assassination prompted an immediate vehicle ban in the Shiite holy city of Najaf, anger among mourners and an intensification of fighting in Baghdad's Sadr City neighborhood.  Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki issued a statement deploring the killing and ordering an investigation.  Al-Sadr issued remarks about the killing in a statement on a Web site. Spokesman Sheikh Salah al-Obeidi emphasized that the cleric is not accusing anyone in particular of the killing but believes that the killers \"are the ones who are following the occupiers' steps and don't want stability for the country.\"  But al-Obeidi called the killing an \"act of provocation\" after the \"siege of Sadr City.\"  He was referring to the battles since Sunday involving members of al-Sadr's Mehdi Army militia and Iraqi security forces dominated by a rival Shiite political movement, the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq.  That fighting started with an offensive in Basra and spread to other Shiite regions, including Sadr City and the Babil provincial capital of Hilla.  The al-Nuri assassination prompted officials to expand the daily curfew in Hilla. Police said a ban on all outside movement that usually begins at 11 p.m. and ends at 8 a.m. will instead start at 8:30 p.m.  Violence continued Friday in several places in Iraq.  Suicide bombings killed at least four people -- three of them police -- and wounded 15, officials said.  The first bombing was in Ramadi, the provincial capital of the predominantly Sunni Anbar province west of Baghdad, an Interior Ministry official said. At least three national police officers were killed and five wounded, the official said.  The second attack took place at a checkpoint about 20 km (12 miles) north of Baiji, according to police, who said the bomber and one other person were killed and 10 were wounded.  The casualties were members of a local Awakening Council who were manning the checkpoint, police said. The suicide bomber was driving a pickup carrying sheep.  Awakening Councils, or Sons of Iraq, are made up of Sunnis who have turned on al Qaeda in Iraq.  Also, at least three people were killed and five wounded in a mortar attack on Baghdad's Palestine Hotel, an Interior Ministry official said.  The Palestine Hotel -- across the Tigris River from the International Zone, the heavily guarded seat of U.S. power in Baghdad -- is in the path of many of the rockets and mortars aimed at the zone.  The U.S. military has blamed Iranian-backed Shiite militants for recent mortar and rocket attacks in Baghdad and International Zone, also known as the Green Zone.  Unmanned aerial vehicles targeted and killed six suspected insurgents in Basra on Friday and six \"heavily armed criminals\" in northeastern Baghdad on Thursday night, the U.S. military said.  Watch the Baghdad drone attack \u00bb  The U.S. and Iraqi militaries have consistently said they have not been targeting specific groups in their recent battles in Shiite areas.  Iraqi and U.S. government officials say they differentiate between Mehdi Army members obeying al-Sadr's seven-month cease-fire pledge and \"gangs,\" \"criminals\" or \"outlaws\" who aren't obeying al-Sadr's orders.  The intra-Shiite fighting in Iraq that has killed hundreds of people in the past two weeks has involved two main movements: members of the Mehdi Army militia loyal to al-Sadr, and Iraqi security forces dominated by the chief political rival of the Sadrists, the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq.  Many of those security forces had been integrated into police and army units from the council's Badr Brigade militia.

{"article": "NEW DELHI, India (CNN)  -- Police imposed a curfew in Jaipur on Wednesday, a day after near-simultaneous bomb attacks in the ancient Indian city killed at least 63 people and wounded more than 200.  Indian women mourn the death of their relatives in the May 13 serial blasts in Jaipur.  Vasundhara Raje, chief minister of Rajasthan -- the state of which Jaipur is the capital -- blamed an \"unnamed international terror group\" for the attack, but said it was too early in the investigation to specify which one.  H.G. Ragavendhra, Jaipur's superintendent of police, told CNN that police found nine newly-purchased bicycles at the scene, and think they were used to carry the explosives. The owner of the bike shop is helping police draw a sketch of the person who purchased them.  Police have also picked up six suspects and were questioning them.  Jaipur, known as the \"pink city\" for its rose-colored forts and palaces, is a popular tourist attraction. The majority Hindu city of 2.7 million people has a sizable Muslim population.  The day-long curfew, authorities said, was meant to prevent \"communal violence.\"  It was intended to prevent large crowds from gathering at the blast site and hampering the investigation, said Jaipur police director Kanhaiya Lal. Also, tempers could flare as mourners spend the day carrying bodies to their home villages and to crematoriums, he said.  Home ministry officials suspect the Islamic militant group Harkat-ul-Jihad al-Islami (HuJi) of being behind the attacks, according to CNN's sister network CNN-IBN and the Press Trust of India. No one has claimed responsibility.  In the past, officials have blamed attacks within its borders on \"foreign\" Islamic extremist groups fighting against Indian rule in the disputed Himalayan territory of Kashmir. It is a term that is commonly understood to refer to Pakistan.  Kashmir has been the source of bitter dispute and two wars between India and Pakistan. Both control parts of the region, which is predominantly Muslim.  Pakistan has denied any involvement in the attacks.  See the aftermath of the explosions. \u00bb  Raje told reporters Wednesday that the military had been placed on alert and security tightened around the borders of the state, the western edge of which lies next to Pakistan.  She also took to task the central government, saying it had provided no advance warning about the possibility of such an attack.  Furthermore, Raje said, the central government left a state-proposed organized crime bill unapproved for two years. The bill would have allowed local police more leeway to interrogate suspects plotting attacks, she said.  On Tuesday evening, eight bombs tore through crowded markets and a packed Hindu temple in Jaipur's walled city. The blasts went off within a 12-minute span and within 500 meters (0.3 miles) of each other. Police defused a ninth bomb.  The Jaipur blasts bear an eerie resemblance in its pattern to a deadly attack two years ago in India's financial capital, Mumbai.  In July 2006, more than 200 people were killed when seven explosions targeted commuter trains in Mumbai, formerly Bombay. In that incident, the explosions went off within a span of 11 minutes.  Both attacks used RDX, one of the most powerful kinds of military explosives, and ammonium nitrate, an oxidizing agent in explosives.  And both attacks took place during the evening hours and on Tuesdays.  The Jaipur blasts occurred near the temple on a day when devotees pray to Hanuman, the Hindu monkey king. Nearby markets and bazaars that were also targeted were filled with tourists and locals.  In the Mumbai attack, the blasts were timed to go off during the height of rush hour. And authorities said the bombs all appeared to have been planted on trains that left the Churchgate station -- used daily by thousands of commuters in the metropolis of more than 11 million people.  Indian officials blamed Pakistan's intelligence services and a Pakistan-based militant group, Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, for the attack. Pakistan, which banned Lashkar-e-Tayyiba in 2002, denied any involvement.  The Jaipur blast has one more element in common with yet another deadly attack: the use of bicycles.  Just as on Tuesday, assailants used bombs strapped to bicycles in an attack at a mosque in the western Indian city of Malegaon in September 2006.  At least 33 people were killed and more than 100 wounded in that explosion, which took place on a Friday -- when the mosque is filled with Muslim worshippers. That attack was also blamed Lashkar-e-Tayyiba.  Authorities have not connected the Jaipur blast to any previous attacks.  HuJi -- or the Movement of Islamic Holy War -- is considered a terrorist organization by the United States.  It is banned in neighboring Bangladesh, where it is accused of carrying out several attacks, including a foiled plot to kill the country's former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in 2000.  And it has been blamed for several attacks inside India, including one at the American Center in Calcutta that killed five policemen in 2002.  India ranks among the countries where terrorism is most common, the U.S. State Department said.  \"The conflict in Jammu and Kashmir, attacks by extreme leftist Naxalites and Maoists in eastern and central India, assaults by ethno-linguistic nationalists in the northeastern states, and terrorist strikes nationwide by Islamic extremists took more than 2,300 lives this year,\" the agency said.

{"article": "ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN)  -- Pakistani forces in the last month foiled a planned attack on the parliament building, the intelligence agency and other federal institutions, the country's interior minister told CNN Sunday.  Pakistan's parliament building was one target of a planned attack, an official says.  In the last four weeks, authorities arrested three men with suicide vests who were plotting to carry out the attacks, said Interior Minister Rehman Malik.  Malik would not say exactly when the men were caught.  Pakistan is in the midst of an intense military offensive against Taliban militants. The militants are suspected of launching attacks inside Pakistan and in neighboring Afghanistan from their haven in the mountainous tribal region along the northwestern border.  On Sunday, a suicide bomber in volatile northwestern Pakistan killed at three people and wounded 15 others, police said.  The bombing rocked the Pakistani city of Peshawar, capital of North West Frontier Province.  The incident took place when police approached a man acting suspiciously. The man ran away, police chased him and a gunfight ensued. The man ran out of bullets and blew himself up.  Two women and seven children were among the injured. Remains of the alleged attacker were found, police said. Five houses were destroyed.  The incident follows a car bombing on Saturday in Peshawar that killed two people, including the spokesman for an extremist group called Ansar ul Islam. Two suspects are in custody.  Malik said Sunday the government's anti-Taliban operations will continue during Ramadan, the Muslim holy month considered to be a time of peace.  Militants in North Waziristan, part of the tribal region, have said they will observe a unilateral ceasefire throughout the month.  \"There will not be a ceasefire during Ramadan. We are not interested in a ceasefire,\" Malik said. \"They haven't kept their commitment in the past. We will continue targeted actions against the Taliban.\"  Malik also said the Taliban killed the father-in-law of its leader Baitullah Mehsud and several other relatives, accusing them of leaking information about his whereabouts.  Pakistan and U.S. officials contend Mehsud was killed in an August 5 drone attack in Waziristan at his father-in-law's house.

{"article": " -- Scientists expect some great travel spots to be altered or ruined by global climate change.  Glaciers in the European Alps may melt as soon as 2050, some scientists say.  Some of the changes are already taking place. Others are expected to be seen in coming decades.  There are two ways to look at this: Either stay home (which might be less depressing and won't add more airline emissions) or get a move on it and see the hot spots you just can't miss.  For those who want to head out, CNN got advice on the best pre-warming travel destinations from Bob Henson, author of \"The Rough Guide to Climate Change\" and a writer at the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado.  Here are Henson's top five choices:  Great Barrier Reef, Australia  Warming temperatures can spell disaster for coral reefs, which depend on a delicate balance of ocean temperature and chemistry to bloom into colorful displays.  Many of the world's reefs already are experiencing \"bleaching\" in which algae living in the coral die and leave behind whitened skeletons.  The Great Barrier Reef -- which is composed of about 2,900 individual reefs and is off the northeast coast of Australia -- is seeing limited bleaching now, and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority expects the problem to grow in coming decades.  Henson said the reefs' colorful displays are not to be missed.  \"It's a feast for the eyes in terms of color, texture variations -- it's just amazing to see,\" he said. \"It's wonderful to be enveloped in the warm water and look down just a few feet below at this amazing spread of ocean life.\"  Boats of people with snorkels typically launch into the reefs from Cairns, Queensland. If you go, tread lightly, Henson said. Visitors can damage the reefs if they get too close.  New Orleans, Louisiana  How much sea levels will rise as the world warms is one of the trickiest parts of the climate change equation. If huge hunks of ice -- such as parts of Greenland and the western shelf of Antarctica -- melt, then the rise is expected to be more dramatic.  \"Nobody knows whether they're going to completely melt or not, but we do know it's not going to happen in the next 10 years,\" Henson said.  But for cities near the coast such as New Orleans, which already sits below sea level, rising waters could spell trouble for tourists and residents alike, even in the relative near term.  \"In the next several hundred years, life there may be difficult, and the cities may become impractical unless we can build large structures to keep the waters at bay,\" he said.  Henson doesn't expect New Orleans to be underwater anytime soon. But travel to the Louisiana city may become more difficult in the future, he said. Scientists expect floods to become more frequent.  \"It's sobering to be in New Orleans and look up at the levees that sit above you and keep out the Mississippi River,\" he said. \"You're standing below the level of the river, looking up.\"  Rocky Mountain National Park, Estes Park, Colorado  Herds of tiny pine beetles are munching away at Colorado's forests, turning the evergreens a sickly red and destroying large patches of trees.  Cold snaps -- which, in mountain terms, mean about five nights of minus-30 temperatures -- usually kill off the native beetles. But winters are warming, and Henson and others said they worry the beetles can't be stopped.  The beetle infestation \"has reached epidemic proportions as a result of climate issues,\" said Kyle Patterson, spokeswoman for the Rocky Mountain National Park.  The beetles are causing problems all over America's mountainous west, but the issue is particularly visible at Patterson's park, northwest of Denver. Henson recommends visiting the park this decade to ensure you can still see the dense forests in decent shape. Some of the reddened forests look beautiful in a strange way, Henson said, but visitors should note that the color isn't natural for pine trees.  \"Come soon. It's happening quickly,\" he said.  Visit in the summer or early fall and take a breathtaking drive to 12,183 feet, Patterson said. Or, come in the winter and enjoy snowshoeing and nearby skiing. Many of the park's 355 miles of hiking trails are open year-round.  Alpine Glaciers, Switzerland  The European Alps sit at a lower altitude than the Rocky Mountains, and their glaciers and ski resorts are therefore more susceptible to melting, Henson said.  A climate expert in Austria recently told National Geographic that the Alps' famed glaciers will disappear entirely between 2030 and 2050. A 2006 report had said they would melt by the end of the century.  Henson said he once took a train through the Alpine glaciers. They're worth seeing before they go -- whenever that happens, he said.  \"They're beautiful; the light blue quality of the meltwater is really stunning,\" he said.  Amazon rain forest, Brazil  Deforestation continues to be the major environmental issue in the Amazon, the world's largest tropical rain forest. But as locals and corporations chop down the Amazon's rich forests to create farmland and to harvest biofuels, climate change may make things worse.  \"The fear is that there will be kind of a feedback where trees are cut down, and it gets warmer and drier\" in the forest until it can't grow back, Henson said.  The best way to visit the forest is by boat, Henson said. That way, you'll leave less of a mark on the struggling ecosystem.  Of course, getting to a boat on the Amazon is not simple, and the long trip can create a lot of heat-trapping pollution. Henson said the destination might be one of those better left alone by tourists.", "Q": ["Q: What are the nature's wonders?

{"article": " -- Never mind that Susan Orlean took an obscure story of flowers and turned it into the masterful 1998 best-seller \"The Orchid Thief\" (and was then played by Meryl Streep in the movie version, \"Adaptation\"). When Orlean told people she was planning to write a biography of Rin Tin Tin, the German shepherd portrayed in movies and on TV, even her friends were puzzled. \"Whaaat?\" many of them said. Sara Nelson talked with Orlean about how and why she spent eight years on the trail of one of the world's most famous canines.  Oprah.com: One man, one mission -- rescuing mutts  Q. The book is titled \"Rin Tin Tin: The Life and the Legend\" [Simon & Schuster], but it's really about the several dogs that played him. Much like \"The Orchid Thief,\" it's also about obsession.  A: I think I'm often drawn, whether I realize it or not, to the idea of what drives people. What do we love? Orchids have been a source of passion since the beginning of time. Rin Tin Tin has been beloved and admired and dreamed about for nearly a hundred years. The dog and the orchids are both things that very disparate and sometimes unlikely people come together over.  Oprah.com: 33 fall must-reads  Q. One of the fascinating things about the book is the way it goes off on tangents -- about Nazi Germany, the 1950s, your own family history -- but still somehow stays on the story of \"Rinty.\" Why did you construct the book this way?  A: I think writing a book is very much a performance. I'm conscious of how readers will feel following a story when they might have started out thinking, I can't believe I'm reading a book about a TV dog. Where I hope you end up is: Oh wow, this is an amazing story and I never thought about the culture this way. Or I didn't know dogs had weddings in the late 1800s. I just hope that people will get excited about learning all these things the way I did when I was writing.  Q. What's the biggest misconception people have about Rin Tin Tin?  A: Either that there was only one dog -- who miraculously lived for 80 or so years, I guess! -- or the exact opposite: that there was no real dog, just a character.  Oprah.com: Middle-school girls give stray dogs a second chance  Q. Were you surprised by how emotionally attached you got to the story?  A: What has always fascinated me and what's very emotional to me is the question of what lasts. People want to, if not live forever, have evidence of their existence live forever. And I think that part of what happened for me was that my dad died in the course of my writing this, and I started thinking about memory, the idea that things come and go and then they're gone and forgotten. But Rin Tin Tin, by being reinvented over and over in people's imaginations, became kind of a timeless model: He just keeps going and going; his story outlives everybody. I feel great tenderness toward the people who devoted themselves to Rin Tin Tin and his history because I think everybody wants to have had their existence noted by the universe.  Oprah.com: 5 books everyone should read at least once  Q. Okay, in the great \"Stones or Beatles?\" tradition, tell us: Are you a Rinty person or a Lassie person?  A: I think you can love both dogs, even if you have an allegiance to one. I have no statistics to back this up, but my guess is that Rin Tin Tin had more boy fans and Lassie more girl fans; after all, Lassie was female, supposedly, and the setting of her story was more domestic, including a mother, whereas Rin Tin Tin was definitely male, living in an all-male world. Maybe they represented opposite ends of a spectrum -- Lassie was about love and nurture, Rin Tin Tin about loyalty and bravery. My dirty secret is that I did truly love Lassie -- but I feel I'm being unfaithful to Rin Tin Tin by confessing that.

{"article": " -- A severely disfigured woman received the nose, cheeks, upper jaw and facial tissue from a female cadaver in the first near-total face transplant in the United States, the woman's surgeon said Wednesday.  Cleveland Clinic doctors replaced 80 percent of a woman's face two weeks ago in the first such U.S. surgery.  The 22-hour face surgery was completed two weeks ago by a team of eight surgeons at the Cleveland Clinic.  The patient had severe deformity in the middle of her face and was missing her right eye and upper jaw, the Cleveland Clinic doctors said. She could not taste or smell, and she had trouble speaking.  Dr. Maria Siemionow, the head of plastic surgery research at the Cleveland, Ohio, hospital, said many people are \"hiding from society because they're afraid to walk to the grocery stores; they're afraid to go to streets because they're called names and humiliated.\"  \"Our patient was called names, and our patient was humiliated,\" she said. \"We very much hope for this special group of patients, there is hope, and one day they will be able to go comfortably from their houses and enjoy the things which we take for granted.\"  The patient is doing well, the doctors said.  Interactive: More details of the surgery \u00bb  Details about the recipient, including her name and age, were withheld at her request.  In the surgery, 80 percent of the woman's face was transplanted. The forehead and chin were left intact.  In this transplant, tissue from the donor's face was shaped and fitted into position. Multiple layers of tissue, bone, muscles and blood vessels, nerve grafts and each artery and vein were connected.  Watch an explanation about face transplants \u00bb  \"Our hope is she should be able to smile again,\" said Dr. Frank A. Papay, chairman of the Dermatology and Plastic Surgery Institute at the Cleveland Clinic.  With physical therapy, surgeons hope the patient will regain her ability to smell and blink and will have other facial functions.  Siemionow said the patient never saw a photo of the donor and said, \"the donor never looks like the recipient. The recipient never looks like the donor.\"  Siemionow had medical and ethical clearance for a full facial transplant since 2004. She said it has taken 20 years of research and four years to find the right patient who understood the risks involved.  The doctors' approach from the beginning was to consider \"only patients who are the most disfigured\" and had \"exhausted all existing procedures,\" Siemionow said.  \"This patient exhausted all conventional means of reconstruction and is the right patient,\" she said.  Watch Dr. Siemionow in the news conference. \u00bb  Dr. Eric Kodish, the professor and chairman of the Cleveland Clinic's Department of Bioethics, said doctors thought she would adhere to medications after the surgery.  \"This patient had very robust decision-making capacity,\" he said.  Like with all transplants, there is a risk that the recipient's body could reject the graft. The doctors say they haven't seen any such signs.  The transplant recipient has to take immune-suppressing drugs for the rest of his or her life to prevent rejection of the donated tissue.  In the past three years, facial transplants have been completed in France and China, but these cases have raised medical and ethical questions. Read about the first facial transplant  Some candidates for a face transplant are survivors of trauma, such as burn or accident victims, who have exhausted all other reconstructive possibilities.  The recipient in France, Isabelle Dinoire, had been mauled by a dog, and the Chinese man, Li Guoxing, was attacked by a bear. Both received major facial disfigurements.  In 2007, a French team performed the third partial facial transplant on a man who was disfigured by a genetic disorder that created large tumors on his face. Watch a 2006 report about China's first face transplant  Guo Shuzhong, the face transplant doctor who handled Li's case, confirmed to CNN that he died in July of unknown causes. Li last visited the hospital in summer 2007, and he stayed in his hometown in Yunnan province.  The doctor told CNN that Li had a checkup in a small hospital in his hometown three weeks before his death but that no health problems had been found. Watch an ITN report about the Li's case  The facial transplants in France and China generated much controversy as questions arose about whether the patients were adequately vetted and informed about the risks. Those procedures have been \"under an ethical cloud,\" said David Young, a professor of plastic surgery at the University of California, San Francisco.  The current face transplant patient understood the risk of rejection and of immunosuppressants, doctors said.  Criticism of facial transplants  Critics such as Peter A. Clark, director of the Institute of Catholic Bioethics at St. Joseph's University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, said a facial transplant introduces unnecessary risks for a procedure that is not a matter of life and death.  \"With something like a liver or kidney transplant, it's a life or death transplant,\" Clark said. \"Even with a kidney or liver [transplant], you have to be put on immunosuppressants with serious side effects.\"  Bioethicist Dr. Arthur Caplan, chairman of the University of Pennsylvania's Medical Ethics Department, said Wednesday on CNN's \"American Morning\" that he initially had similar qualms about the facial transplant, which improves the quality of a life rather than saving it, but was gradually convinced.  People with major facial disfigurements \"don't come out and basically stay at home and have a huge suicide rate,\" Caplan said. \"They're really up against it.\"  At the news conference Wednesday, Kodish said the transplant had \"abundant moral justification\": the face as a personal embodiment as self.  He added that people with disfigurements are often isolated and suffer tremendously and that this case was \"not cosmetic surgery in any sense.\"  Patient's reaction  Doctors at the Cleveland Clinic said that because the patient has limited vision after the surgery, she has yet to see herself.  \"At this point she can't see herself but can feel her face,\" Siemionow said. \"She was happy when she could go over her face\" and could feel that \"she has a nose, she has jaws and has a full face.\"  After the surgery, the patient was heavily sedated from being on the breathing machine.  As she was slowly awakening, medical staff members asked her how she was feeling and whether she was comfortable.  \"She gave a thumbs up, first indication she was comfortable,\" said Dr. Chad Gordon, a fellow at the clinic's department of plastic surgery. \"She has been speaking to us very slightly. Most of communication has been through writing.\"  Siemionow said the patient will need re-educate her facial motion and need three to six months of nerve regeneration.

{"article": "ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Iran has condemned the kidnapping of one of its diplomats in northwest Pakistan on Thursday, calling it an \"act of terrorism,\" an Iranian foreign ministry spokesman said.  Pakistani policemen inspect a bullet-riddled car of a kidnapped Iranian diplomat on Thursday.  \"Pakistan should do its best to protect foreign diplomats and their residential places,\" the spokesman Hassan Qashqavi said, according to Iran's state-run IRNA news agency.  At least four gunmen abducted Heshmatollah Attarzadeh near his home in Peshawar as he headed to work at the Iranian consulate, according to Pakistani police and Iranian diplomatic officials.  His bodyguard, a Pakistani police officer, was shot and killed when the two men tried to resist, a Peshawar police official said.  Pakistan's Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi also \"strongly condemned\" the attack, and informed Iran that the government \"will take all necessary measures for his safe and early recovery.\"  Attarzadeh is a commercial attache for the Iranian consulate in Peshawar. It is the second attack targeting a foreign worker in Peshawar in two days.  An American aid worker was shot and killed outside the Iranian consulate in Peshawar on Wednesday.  Stephen Vance worked for a non-profit foundation funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development that helped find jobs for people in Pakistan's tribal regions, according to a statement from his employer, the Cooperative Housing Foundation International.  \"Stephen had fully immersed himself in the community in which he worked,\" the statement said. \"He dressed traditionally and even sent his children to local schools.\"  Vance, 52, a native of California, is survived by his wife and five children -- all of whom lived with him in Peshawar -- CHF International official Bill Holbrook told CNN.  The attacks come less than three months after gunmen opened fire on a vehicle carrying the senior U.S. diplomat in Peshawar, Lynne Tracy. She escaped unharmed.  Peshawar is the capital of Pakistan's North West Frontier Province, an area rife with Islamic extremists and the site of recent clashes between security forces and militants.  In late June, Pakistan's military launched an offensive in the province -- the biggest push against extremists in the tribal region since the civilian government took power in March. Islamic militants vowed to retaliate.  Since then, militants have launched several deadly attacks.  Pakistan's new government has tried to negotiate a deal with militants as part of its efforts to bypass military might and achieve peace through talks.", "Q": ["Q: What day was the American aid worker killed?

{"article": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- The last survivor of the Titanic, 97-year-old Millvina Dean, is auctioning off her remaining mementos of the doomed ship to pay nursing home bills.  Millvina Dean, 97, is trying to raise money so she can stay in the nursing home she prefers.  The auction, which is expected to raise up to $50,000 for her, is set to take place Saturday near her home in England.  It is the second auction in less than a year for Dean, who was a 9-week-old when the ship sank on its maiden voyage in 1912.  Among the items going under the hammer at Henry Aldridge & Son is a canvas bag that might have been used to lift the infant Dean from a lifeboat to a rescue ship, said Alan Aldridge of the auction house.  \"Historical documents say she was lifted from the lifeboat onto Carpathia, the rescue ship, in a mail sack,\" Aldridge said. After her rescue, Dean, her mother and her brother returned to England with a canvas sack, among other possessions.  \"There is speculation that this would have been the bag. It's a leather and canvas bag. You would easily get a child or infant in it,\" Aldridge said, though he added that research by the Smithsonian, the British Postal Museum and the Liverpool Maritime Museum showed no proof that Dean had been taken off the lifeboat in that particular bag.  Given that the auctioneer cannot prove Dean was rescued in the bag, \"we expect it to fetch \u00a33,000 ($4,480). If it was the bag she was rescued in, it would be \u00a330,000 to \u00a340,000, ($44,800 to $60,000), but we can't prove it. It depends on what people are prepared to believe.\"  Aldridge said he was eager to raise as much for Dean as possible.  \"She's in a residential nursing home. She's 97 years of age. She's paying \u00a33,000 a month in nursing home fees,\" he said -- the amount he hopes her canvas bag will sell for.  \"As she said, \u00a33,000 a month is \u00a336,000 a year, which is a lot of money,\" he said. \"When she runs out of money, the state will pay fees for her, but while she can pay her fees, she decides where she gets her care. When the state pays, they decide.\"  Dean's previous sale, in October, raised just over \u00a330,000, Aldridge said.  \"It's made a lot of people aware of her plight; a lot of people have sent her funds,\" he said.  Dean never married and had no children.  \"There are cousins, but there is no one directly to support her,\" Aldridge said. \"The property she lived in [before she moved to the nursing home] was not hers. She's just an ordinary little old lady.  \"If she's lucky, she'll get another four or five years; she's quite a fit lady,\" he said.  Dean was not available to speak to CNN herself because of a throat infection, Aldridge said.  The auction will include 17 items from her collection, most of them memorabilia related to the Titanic and signed by her but not from the ship itself.  The auction, in Devizes, southwest England, will also include a collection of letters from the estate of Titanic survivor Barbara Dainton-West, estimated to fetch \u00a340,000 to \u00a360,000 ($60,000 to $90,000).

{"article": "  -- Facing near-record floodwaters, Red River communities in Minnesota and North Dakota raced Tuesday to shore up levees and dikes, officials said.  \"We're in the full flood fight mode here,\" Fargo, North Dakota, City Administrator Pat Zavoral said.  Last week, warm weather and rain melted snow south of Fargo and Moorhead, Minnesota, causing the Red River to swell as it flows north. Upstream, snow and ice have yet to melt, pushing water back toward the two cities.  Forecasters predict the river will crest Saturday about 20 feet above flood stage. Last year, the river rose to a record 40.8 feet at Fargo.  \"We have every contractor we have in the area on a 24-hour shift, preparing dikes, hauling dirt, delivering sandbags,\" Fargo Mayor Dennis Walaker said.  \"We have never lost a flood fight here in Fargo,\" he said. \"We're going to be optimistic about this for the rest of the week, that we're going to be able to save our community one more time.\"  Volunteers have answered the call to fill 1 million sandbags this week, Zavoral said. \"We're putting up temporary clay levees, and we've produced sandbags, and we're delivering them to the low-lying neighborhoods,\" he said.  Early Tuesday, the river level stood at 27.6 feet, according to the National Weather Service. Flood stage is 18 feet, according to the service.  \"We thought we had a couple more weeks, and with the weather and the quick thaw and the rains we've had recently, it's really made it more difficult and it's really sped up the crest,\" Fargo police Sgt. Carlos Nestler said.  Residents in Fargo and Moorhead are busy building sandbag dikes along the river's edge.  Fargo's Kurt Kaye is doing what he did last year, helping friends protect their home from the rising Red River, which runs through their backyard.  Like most residents, he said he's resolved to keep the water at bay. \"I think everyone is a little tired of it, but they'll get behind it and go,\" he said. \"They need to get it done to save their houses.\"  Zavoral, the city administrator, said Fargo is better prepared this year to deal with a major flood.  \"We've spent about $10 million putting in permanent flood protection in some of the neighborhoods and bought out about 26 homes in the low-lying areas,\" he said.  City officials have said they believe they'll need about 1 million fewer sandbags than were used last year.  Is severe weather happening near you?

Guests arrive at the reopening of the Taj Mahal Palace hotel in Mumbai.  The suspect, Mohammed Ajmal Amir Kasab, wrote a letter to Pakistan's High Commission in India that was handed over to Pakistan's acting high commissioner in New Delhi on Monday evening, India's foreign ministry said.

{"article": "TEHRAN, Iran (CNN) -- Ameneh Bahrami is certain that one day she'll meet someone, fall in love and get married. But when her wedding day comes, her husband won't see her eyes, and she won't see her husband. Bahrami is blind, the victim of an acid attack by a spurned suitor.  Ameneh Bahrami said her attacker pestered her with marriage demands.  If she gets her way, her attacker will suffer the same fate. The 31-year-old Iranian is demanding the ancient punishment of \"an eye for an eye,\" and, in accordance with Islamic law, she wants to blind Majid Movahedi, the man who blinded her.  \"I don't want to blind him for revenge,\" Bahrami said in her parents' Tehran apartment. \"I'm doing this to prevent it from happening to someone else.\"  Bahrami says she first crossed paths with Movahedi in 2002, when they attended the same university.  She was a 24-year-old electronics student. He was 19. She never noticed him until they shared a class. He sat next to her one day and brushed up against her. Bahrami says she knew it wasn't an accident.  \"I moved away from him,\" she said, \"but he brushed up against me again.\"  Watch Bahrami return to the attack scene for the first time \u00bb  When Bahrami stood up in class and screamed for him to stop, Movahedi just looked at her in stunned silence. He wouldn't stay silent for long.  Bahrami said that over the next two years, Movahedi kept harassing her and making threats, even as he asked her to marry him. \"He told me he would kill me. He said, 'You have to say yes.' \"  On a November afternoon in 2004, Movahedi's threats turned to violence.  That day at 4:30 p.m., Bahrami left the medical engineering company where she worked. As she walked to the bus stop, she remembers sensing someone behind her.  She turned around and was startled to see Movahedi. A moment later came the agonizing pain. Movahedi had thrown something over her. What felt like fire on her face was acid searing through her skin.  \"I was just yelling, 'I'm burning! I'm burning! For God's sake, somebody help me!' \"  The acid seeped into Bahrami's eyes and streamed down her face and into her mouth. When she covered her face with her hands, streaks of acid ran down her fingers and onto her forearms.  Watch how the still-pungent acid destroyed Bahrami's clothes \u00bb  Two weeks after the attack, Movahedi turned himself in to police and confessed in court. He was convicted in 2005 and has been behind bars all along.  Bahrami's lawyer, Ali Sarrafi, said Movahedi had never shown any remorse. \"He says he did it because he loved her,\" Sarrafi said.  Attack victims in Iran usually accept \"blood money\": a fine in lieu of harsh punishment. With no insurance and mounting medical bills, Bahrami could've used the cash, but she said no.  \"I told the judge I want an eye for an eye,\" Bahrami said. \"People like him should be made to feel my suffering.\"  Watch how the acid destroyed Bahrami's eyes (includes graphic content) \u00bb  Bahrami's demand has outraged some human rights activists. Criticizing acid-attack victims is almost unheard of, but some Internet bloggers have condemned Bahrami's decision.  \"We cannot condone such cruel punishment,\" wrote one blogger. \"To willingly inflict the same treatment on a person under court order is a violation of human rights.\"  Late last year, an Iranian court gave Bahrami what she asked for. It sentenced Movahedi to be blinded with drops of acid in each eye. This month, the courts rejected Movahedi's appeal.  Bahrami's lawyer, Sarrafi, said the sentencing might be carried out in a matter of weeks. He said he doesn't think Bahrami will change her mind. Neither does Bahrami.  \"If I don't do this and there is another acid attack, I will never forgive myself for as long as I live,\" she said.  Bahrami is largely self-sufficient despite not being able to see. She can make a salad, prepare tea and walk up the five flights of stairs that lead to her parents' apartment.  She has undergone more than a dozen surgeries on her badly scarred face, but she says there are many more to come. She can't afford to pay for her medical care, so she's using the Internet to raise money.  She's lost her big brown eyes, but she likes to smile, especially when she imagines her wedding day.  \"I always see myself as someone who can see and sometimes see myself in a beautiful wedding gown, and why not?\"", "Q": ["Q: What punishment does she want her attacker to receive?

The Narayanthi Royal Palace has been converted into a museum.  \"The national flag is fluttering in the hands of the people in the royal palace now,\" said Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala at a ceremony at the former palace Sunday.

Gyanendra's departure came following the declaration of the former Himalayan kingdom as a republic last month.  The monarchy's end after 239 years of rule was the culmination of a two-year peace process in which Maoist insurgents in Nepal gave up their armed struggle, joined mainstream politics and won the most seats in April's election for the Constituent Assembly.  The assembly is tasked with rewriting the constitution, deciding the country's future political system and governing the nation.

{"article": "Washington (CNN) -- Fears that Haitian earthquake survivors would engage in a massive and deadly ocean migration to South Florida have thus far been unfounded, according to federal and local government officials, who say they continue to plan for such an exodus only as a precaution.  The U.S. Coast Guard said it has witnessed only normal maritime traffic around Haiti, and it has not intercepted any Haitians attempting illegal crossings into U.S. waters. Nor does it see people preparing for voyages.  Florida officials have asked for federal government funding to shelter 10,000 refugees, but said that was done only as a precaution.  Meanwhile, the U.S. Air Force continues daily flights of its EC-130J Commando Solo aircraft -- a radio station in the sky -- which is broadcasting warnings to would-be migrants, as well as information about where people can find food and aid.  List of missing, found people in Haiti  The plane is broadcasting a recorded message from Raymond Joseph, Haiti's ambassador to the United States, saying: \"Listen, don't rush on boats to leave the country. Because I'll be honest with you: If you think you will reach the U.S. and all the doors will be wide open to you, that's not at all the case. And they will intercept you right on the water and send you back home where you came from.\"  State Department deputy spokesman Gordon Duguid said the message is \"part of the U.S. effort to help keep Haitians safe.\"  \"We don't want people to endanger their lives by taking risk to try to get to the U.S. at this time,\" he said.  The U.S. military will be distributing special radios to Haitians this week in an effort to get messages and news spread as far as possible.  Some 50,000 portable solar-powered and windup radios will be distributed by the U.S. military joint task force that is deploying troops in Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince, and other severely stricken parts of the country.  Government officials say past migrations from Cuba and Haiti were the result of large geopolitical events, circumstances that differ significantly from those in Haiti now. Further, there is a large U.S. government presence in Haiti and offshore -- factors that will make any migration easier for the government to detect.  \"At this point, we are not expecting a massive influx of Haitian individuals,\" said Mike Stone, spokesman for the Florida Emergency Operations Center. Immediately after the January 12 quake, the state \"dusted off\" a preparedness plan known as Operation Vigilant Sentry \"just in case,\" he said.  The plan has been in place since 2003.  David Halstead, director of Florida's Division of Emergency Management, said the state's request for \"safe housing\" for 10,000 Haitian survivors was based on the plan. That is the maximum number Florida officials believe the state could support in any mass migration, and only for a limited period, he said. It is based on the expectation that people would first be housed at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba and federal immigration detention centers.  \"I think right now, with everyone watching Haiti... for any boat or ship to be able to get out of there illegally would be a miracle upon itself,\" Halstead said Tuesday.  The U.S. Coast Guard said it has seen \"nothing out of the ordinary\" off Haiti's coast in recent days. Ferry vessels have been crowded, \"but they're not going anyplace we wouldn't expect them to,\" Lt. Cmdr. Christopher O'Neil said.  Haitians have migrated to the United States by boat in relatively small numbers for at least the past 30 years, with several notable spikes. An estimated 25,000 Haitians were among the mass migration of more than 150,000 asylum seekers, primarily Cubans, during the Mariel boatlift in 1980. In the early 1990s, tens of thousands of Haitians migrated to the United States after the coup d'etat deposing President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.

{"article": "DHAKA, Bangladesh (CNN) -- Army convoys are combing areas around the Bangladeshi border guard headquarters, vowing to punish participants in this week's bloody mutiny, which killed nearly 100 army officers and civilians, according to The New Nation newspaper.  Bangladeshi firefighters continued to uncover bodies Friday of Bangladesh Rifles officers from a mass grave.  More than 160 army officers were inside the headquarters of the Bangladesh Rifles (BDR) when the mutiny broke out on Wednesday morning, local reports said.  So far, 88 bodies have been recovered from mass graves in the outskirts of Dhaka, the newspaper reported.  At least 22 bodies have also been recovered from the Buriganga River after the rebelling troops dumped them down a sewer during the standoff, authorities said.  The 88 found dead were among those 169 officers, the newspaper reported. Another 27 emerged from their captivity in the headquarters of the BDR, a 65,000-strong paramilitary outfit primarily responsible for guarding the country's borders. About 200 BDR soldiers have been arrested.  The mutiny began Wednesday when BDR members took dozens of their superiors hostage.  It was the second day of BDR Week, when army officers and troop members from various BDR outposts along the border were in the capital for celebrations.  The New Nation reported that the mutinous border guards surrendered their weapons on Thursday after the government declared an amnesty.  The rebellion was spurred by years of discontent among the ranks of the BDR troops.  Recruits complained their army superiors dismissed their appeals for more pay, subsidized food and opportunities to participate in U.N. peacekeeping operations.

{"article": " -- The question is starting to feel a little old: Whom will Barack Obama pick as his vice president?  Sen. Barack Obama has a big event scheduled Saturday. Will his No. 2 man (or woman) be by his side?  With the clock ticking (the Democratic VP candidate delivers a big speech next Wednesday) the announcement is at most days and at least a few hours away.  Everyday seems to be \"the day,\" the day the guessing game will finally end.  In a poke at all of the VP buzz, the Obama campaign sent an e-mail to reporters Wednesday with the subject line \"Vice presidential...\"  The first line of the e-mail: \"Just kidding.\"  The e-mail contained details about Obama's schedule with no mention of any of the potential vice presidential candidates.  But if the top contenders have any inside information, they're doing a good job of keeping quiet.  Sen. Joe Biden told reporters camped outside his Delaware home Tuesday that it's not him.  \"You got better things to do, guys; I'm not the guy,\" he said.  Asked where he would be Saturday -- when Obama is reportedly scheduled to hold a campaign event in Springfield, Illinois, that may feature his new running mate -- Biden replied, \"here,\" pointing to his driveway.  He softened up a little later that night, telling reporters, \"I promise you, I don't know anything.\"  Along with Biden, Sen. Evan Bayh of Indiana and Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine are considered to be among the top tier of VP contenders.  Watch the latest on Obama's VP selection \u00bb  Bayh has managed to stay out of the spotlight this week. Does that mean he's dodging the question?  He hit the Sunday talk show circuit this weekend and tried out the attack dog role, criticizing Republican John McCain for his stance on Georgia, Iraq and national security.  When asked about the veepstakes, the former governor said he had \"nothing to report today.\"  Kaine, on the other hand, seems to have no qualms about taking the main stage this week.  A relative newcomer to national politics, Kaine is scheduled to appear alongside Obama on Thursday as the presumptive Democratic nominee campaigns in central Virginia. Could he be introduced as Obama's No. 2 man?  The pair will host an invitation-only town hall meeting Thursday in Chesterfield County, a suburb of Richmond. Kaine's sturdy performance in the traditionally conservative Richmond suburbs helped vault him to the governorship in 2005.  Obama has stops scheduled in Virginia on Wednesday and Thursday before returning home to Illinois for the Springfield event, which takes place where he first kicked off his presidential run.  The event marks the beginning of a tour of battleground states leading into next week's convention in Denver, Colorado.  The Obama campaign has kept the details on both the timing and selection of the running mate under wraps. They would neither confirm or deny whether Obama would appear with his VP candidate this weekend. iReport.com: Whom do you think Obama should pick?  Although the focus in recent days has been on Bayh, Biden and Kaine, there are quite a few other serious contenders, and a curveball pick could always be in the works.

{"article": " -- Police in Milwaukee are working to track down a serial killer linked to at least seven unsolved homicides dating back more than two decades, authorities said.  Five victims (clockwise from top left): Debora Harris, Joyce Mims, Tonya Miller, Quithreaun Stokes, Sheila Farrior.  Law enforcement officials in the Wisconsin city have matched the unknown man's DNA with seven women -- six prostitutes and a runaway involved in the drug trade. The deaths occurred between 1986 and 2007.  \"Six of the victims were women who were working as prostitutes -- high-risk behavior that makes them vulnerable to crime,\" authorities said.  Police believe the killer had sex with the runaway, but she was killed by someone else.  The developments have prompted officials to form a local, state and federal task force to investigate the homicides. A state lab is working to determine whether the DNA of at least 23 other slain prostitutes matches that of the killer.  \"In the past, we might have linked some of these homicides through their method of operation, but theory has given way to technology,\" said Edward Flynn, the Milwaukee police chief. \"Within the last couple of weeks, we have been able to confirm a link.\"  Flynn, who described the killer as an \"unknown suspect who conducts his business in secret,\" said the investigation would require tips from the community.  \"This suspect has been able to avoid and evade law enforcement for these last 23 years. He has never been arrested for a felony as he does not appear in any DNA database,\" Flynn said.  Police said 42 prostitutes were killed between 1986 and 2007, and that 31 percent of the cases have been solved. There has been a higher clearance rate -- 78 percent -- in other homicides.  Of the seven killed, two were in 1986, three in 1995, one in 1997 and one in 2007. The runaway was one of the three killed in 1995.  Flynn said there have been \"patterned homicides\" discovered across the country as a result of advanced DNA technology, citing investigations in Los Angeles, California; Mesa, Arizona; and Las Vegas, Nevada. However, he said there is no link with the Milwaukee cases.  In discussing advances in DNA technology, Flynn said there were no matches in 1990s, two around 2000 and the seven have been linked in recent weeks.  \"We already have determined that five suspects in murders of other prostitutes -- completely unrelated to this investigation -- have been identified because their DNA match open homicide cases. Three of them already are in prison for cleared homicides of prostitutes,\" police said in a statement Tuesday.

{"article": " -- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration Tuesday ordered the makers of certain antibiotics to add a \"black box\" label warning -- the FDA's strongest -- to alert patients of possible tendon ruptures and tendonitis.  Cipro is one of the drugs for which the FDA will require a \"black box\" label warning about tendon problems.  \"The new language will strengthen the existing warnings,\" said Dr. Edward Cox, director of the FDA's Office of Antimicrobial Products.  The FDA is requiring the label warnings and a medication guide for fluoroquinolone drugs, which include Cipro, Levaquin, Avelox, Noroxin and Floxin.  The consumer group Public Citizen asked the FDA in August 2006 to put the \"black box\" warning on Cipro and other fluoroquinolones, and also to warn doctors. Earlier this year, Public Citizen filed a lawsuit to force the FDA to take those actions.  Public Citizen said Tuesday it was \"pleased\" with the FDA's order but added \"there is still more that the FDA must do.\"  \"The FDA is silent on our request that it also send a warning letter to physicians clearly describing possible adverse reactions, such as tendon pain, so that patients can be switched to alternative treatments before tendons rupture,\" the group said. \"We are troubled that the FDA is not doing everything within its power to prevent more people from needlessly suffering disabling tendon ruptures.\"  When asked about the lawsuit and why it didn't order the \"black box\" label warning until now, Cox stressed that the FDA included warning information with the drugs from 2001 until 2004, and updated the information last year.  Dr. Gupta explains more on antibiotic risks \u00bb  \"There has been ongoing work to update the labeling of the fluoroquinolone drug products,\" Cox said. \"We have been working on this issue and making progress over time.\"  The companies that make the fluoroquinolone drugs will be required to submit label safety changes and the medication guide within 30 days of receiving the notification from the FDA or provide a reason why they do not believe such labeling changes are necessary, Cox said.  Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals Inc., which holds licenses for Cipro and Avelox, said it would make the changes requested by the FDA but defended the drugs as \"well-tolerated and effective in all approved indications.\" Schering-Plough markets Cipro and Avelox in the United States under agreement with Bayer.  Ortho-McNeil-Janssen Pharmaceuticals, which markets Levaquin in the United States, also said it would abide by the FDA's request.  Merck & Co., the maker of Noroxin, said it, too, would update the drug's label. But Merck noted it has stopped promotion of Noroxin because of the widespread availability of its generic form.  Oscient Pharmaceuticals (Factive), Daiichi Sankyo (Floxin) and Dipomed (Proquin) did not immediately respond to CNN's requests for comment.  The fluoroquinolones drugs can increase the risk of tendonitis and tendon rupture -- which is about 1 in 100,000 -- by three to four times, according to the FDA's Dr. Renata Albrecht.  \"This risk is further increased in those over age 60, in kidney, heart, and lung transplant recipients, and with use of concomitant steroid therapy,\" the FDA said in a statement.  Albrecht said that sometimes patients have no symptoms before they experience a rupture in their tendon -- commonly their Achilles tendon.  \"Sometimes it's been reported on the first day of taking a fluoroquinolone... a sudden snap or popping sound that is tendon rupture with no preceding warning,\" she said.  Normally, she added, that patients experience some pain or inflammation \"a week or two before the patient will rupture.\"  Public Citizen, founded in 1971 by consumer activist Ralph Nader, said more than 400 cases of tendon rupture and more than 300 cases of tendonitis in patients using fluoroquinolones were reported between November 1997 and December 2007.  \"Because only a small fraction of cases are typically reported to the FDA, the actual number of ruptures and other tendon injuries attributable to the antibiotic is much higher,\" the group said.  The FDA would only say that it has received \"hundreds\" of reports of tendon problems linked to fluoroquinolones, without being more specific, citing the ongoing lawsuit. But Cox said \"the FDA continues to receive a considerable number of reports on tendon adverse effects.\"  Patients should stop taking fluoroquinolone antibiotics at the first sign of tendon pain, avoid exercise and contact their doctor, the FDA said.  Cox said the FDA would not require companies to send letters to doctors alerting them about the connection between tendon problems and the antibiotics.  \"It is possible under REMS [Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy] to ask for a letter [to doctors],\" Cox said. \"Certainly for sponsors that would choose to go forward with a letter, we'll be happy to work with them.\"", "Q": ["Q: What organization ordered warning to be put on certain antibiotics?

{"article": " -- Fabio Cannavaro is to join the Italian national squad on Sunday for their World Cup qualifier against Cyprus next week, despite being under the cloud of a drug test controversy.  Fabioo Cannavaro's proudest moment came in 2006 when he led Italy to World Cup glory.  It was revealed on Thursday that the 36-year-old Juventus defender recently failed a drug test after taking a medicine that contained the banned substance cortisone.  Cannavaro was interviewed by the Italian Olympic Committee's (CONI) anti-doping prosecutor Ettore Torri on Thursday night in Turin but national coach Marcello Lippi does not expect his star to be absent from the squad.  \"I have not spoken to Cannavaro,\" Lippi told reporters. \"Will he be here with us on Sunday? Of course he will.  \"I have not spoken to Cannavaro,\" added national team doctor Enrico Castellacci. \"But he is calm and serene. This is just a bureaucratic case.\"  Juventus claimed the defender needed cortisone treatment for an insect sting in August. The player requested an exemption from taking drugs tests on the grounds of having taken a medication in an emergency situation but his request did not include a document necessary to complete the application.  While awaiting a decision, Cannavaro took an anti-doping test after a Serie A game at Roma which returned a positive result.  \"When he came to the national team, after the Roma game, he told us what had happened and he told us that without the medicine that contained cortisone he would have had a reaction, an anaphylactic shock,\" Castellacci said.  \"We asked Juventus for all the necessary documents regarding the medicine taken by Cannavaro and all the communication is in our possession.\"  Cannavaro will not travel to Dublin for Saturday's World Cup qualifier against Ireland as he serves a one-match ban, but is expected to lead the Azzurri in Wednesday's qualifier against Cyprus in Parma.", "Q": ["Q: What did Cannavaro test positive for?

{"article": " -- A Colorado company's recall last week of beef products possibly contaminated with E. coli has been expanded, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said this week.  The recall came as a result of \"an ongoing investigation into 24 illnesses in multiple states,\" the USDA said.  The initial recall of 41,280 pounds announced last Wednesday was voluntarily expanded Sunday to include an additional 380,000 pounds of products made by the JBS Swift Beef Company, of Greeley, Colorado, the USDA said.  The recall came as a result of \"an ongoing investigation into 24 illnesses in multiple states, of which at least 18 appear to be associated,\" the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service said in a written statement.  USDA spokesman Brian Mabry said no fatalities had been reported.  On its Web site, the company said the suspect beef was produced at its Greeley plant on April 21 and distributed nationally and internationally.  \"Each of our customers will be personally informed of this recall by phone,\" the wholesaler said. A spokesman would not identify those customers to CNN.  \"That's ridiculous!\" said Sarah Klein, a staff attorney for the Washington-based Center for Science in the Public Interest. \"JBS should be able to say who they sold meat to, and those companies should be able to say, 'These are the products we created from them.' \"  She expressed concern that nearly seven months into the Obama administration, a key undersecretary position at the USDA has not been filled, which may be slowing the government's ability to respond to such health threats.  \"That person in that position would have significant public health experience and understand how these processes work, how meat enters the chain of commerce,\" Klein said.  The recall underscores the need for \"a comprehensive animal identification system\" that would allow meat suppliers to trace their products to an individual ranch, she said.  Klein urged supermarkets that use customer loyalty cards to track shoppers' purchases to determine those who have bought the recalled meat.  Boxes of the recalled product bear the establishment number \"EST. 969\" inside the USDA mark of inspection, the identifying package date of \"042109\" and a time stamp ranging from \"0618\" to \"1130,\" the statement said. It added that some of the beef products might have undergone further processing and might not have the \"EST. 969\" marking on products for sale directly to consumers.  The USDA urged any customers with concerns to contact the store where they bought the meat.  JBS spokesman Chandler Keys said his company's products may have had nothing to do with the outbreak.  \"It is important for consumers to note that the recalled product from the date in question was sold by JBS as whole muscle cuts, not as ground beef,\" Keys said on the company's Web site. \"The ground beef that might have been associated with illness was produced by other companies who often do not use the antimicrobial intervention steps we employ in our facility to reduce the risk of the beef products.\"  He said JBS agreed to expand its recall \"out of an abundance of caution for consumers.\"  Symptoms of infection with E. coli bacteria can include severe or bloody diarrhea, vomiting and severe abdominal cramping.  The USDA urged consumers to cook all ground beef or ground beef patties to an internal temperature of 160 degrees Fahrenheit to kill any bacteria.

{"article": " -- A little over a week ago nearly every media outlet was fixated on Tiger Woods and his apology news conference. We saw pundits, columnists, journalists, radio talk show hosts, psychologists, body language experts, entertainers and anyone with an opinion weigh in on the sincerity of Tiger: Was he really sorry for committing adultery, should he apologize further and hundreds of other angles.  Some even described him as a fallen athlete who will lose millions of endorsements and a man who has destroyed the trust he built up with his fans. I even heard one woman say she needed Tiger to apologize, yet couldn't articulate why it mattered so much to her, especially since she wasn't his wife, kin to him, and wasn't a family friend.  Yet if there was ever one athlete we could truly place in that category of fallen athlete, it would be former NBA star Jayson Williams.  While Tiger brought shame on himself and his family by his admitted extramarital affairs, he has broken no laws, and what he did doesn't affect us at all.  Yet Williams is another matter. This week, he was led away in handcuffs after being sentenced in a New Jersey court for fatally shooting a limo driver on February 14, 2002.  Some carried his sentencing live. Yet most networks ignored his case, which ended eight years of courtroom drama.  Frankly, if there was a case that is instructive to kids who look up to athletes, it's Jayson, not Tiger.  Jayson Williams was a gregarious and fun-loving man who could light up the court. After injuries took their toll and ended his NBA career, he was a rising TV analyst with NBC, a playful man with a big heart.  I'll never forget watching him on \"Oprah\" with his dad as they talked about building his huge mansion, how it was a place where hundreds of kids traveled through as a result of his charitable endeavors and how he had a zest for life.  But that all ended on the night the life of Costas Christofi ended. After a dinner, Williams returned to his home and was showing several folks his many guns when he snapped his double-barreled 12-gauge shotgun shut. Williams didn't realize it was loaded, and a single bullet hit Christofi in the chest.  A panicked Williams put the gun in Christofi's hand, and even jumped in his pool, hoping to wash away the evidence.  Williams was acquitted of aggravated manslaughter and convicted on four counts of coverup. He settled with Christofi's family for $2 million, all while the case went back and forth through the legal system.  While that was happening, Williams began to lose it all. His wife filed for divorce; he was hit with a stun gun by police after an encounter; he crashed his vehicle in another incident and threatened to kill himself.  Williams was a man who fell victim to alcohol and guns, a deadly combination.  He was sentenced to five years in jail and is eligible for parole in 18 months. Everything he had -- money, fame, budding TV career, marriage, friends, respect -- all lost because of the horrible decisions he made one fateful night.  Jayson Williams didn't achieve the level of fame as Tiger Woods, but we can surely learn more from his fall from grace than Tiger's. The former killed a man, the latter cheated on his wife. Both morally wrong, only one legally wrong.  Tiger will undoubtedly return to the golf course one day. Sure, he can fret about losing millions in endorsements and may have to confront losing his wife. But Williams must forever live with the memory of a man dying as a result of his actions.  We all may want to focus on Tiger, but it's the tragedy of Jayson Williams that should have all of us talking and examining what went wrong in the charmed life of a basketball star.

{"article": "Camp Lejeune, North Carolina (CNN) -- On a base accustomed to deploying Marines into some of the most hostile war zones, you would expect some hesitancy when units from here were asked to surge into some of the worst fighting since the start of the war in Afghanistan.  This week, the first of 1,500 Marines will be part of the initial wave of President Obama's surge plan to head to Afghanistan's restive provinces to support Marines and soldiers fighting a dug-in Taliban force.  However, many Marines we talked to in this coastal, scrub pine-covered North Carolina base are more than excited to go, despite the dangers that await them.  \"I'm absolutely ecstatic about the situation. I've got a good group of Marines that are behind me, so I'm real excited about the deployment,\" said Sgt. Jason Bendett of the 3rd Platoon, A Company, 2nd Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion, based at Lejeune.  But combat deaths in Afghanistan are up -- 305 this year, from 155 during 2008 -- giving pause to even the most motivated Marines.  \"I think I wouldn't be human if I wasn't worried, obviously this being my first combat deployment, but the Taliban are an experienced group of fighters, and I'm not taking that for granted,\" 2nd Lt. John Auer, also of the 3rd Platoon, said during some of his final rifle range training before he deploys.  Members of this unit say they have been waiting and waiting as they watched fellow Marines deploy ahead of them this year, and they say they are more than ready to go.  They were supposed to go to Iraq in June, but as priorities shifted, they were reassigned to Afghanistan's Helmand province, where Marines are in daily battles with the Taliban.  \"Having months to train and putting Marines out in the elements in Southern California, where we train, gives them a chance to see what the atmospherics are going to be like and to work as a team, so this is perfect, and we are really looking forward to this,\" Auer said.  \"These guys have a lot of training under their belts, more than Marine units typically get in this situation. Senior military leaders have a lot of big expectations for this team,\" said the unit's first sergeant, Ronald Neff.  Last week, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Mike Mullen, gave some of the deploying Marines an impassioned speech about what they will face.  \"We don't have a lot of time. The slope on this insurgency is going in the wrong direction, and it has picked up, three years, each year to a significant degree,\" Mullen said, describing the deteriorating security situation.  \"I believe the strategy that the president laid out, the decision that he's made, is the right decision. Both those are right, and we will now move out, given our orders, and we'll carry them out. And again, I couldn't be more confident and more pleased that you are going to be at the core of that,\" he told the hundreds of Marines in attendance.  Many of the Marines there are young and are facing their first combat deployment. Although all the bravado of a newly minted Marine ready for combat looks and sounds ready to fight, their eyes showed worry and concern for the unknown as they listened to Mullen.  \"Best thing you can hope for is that you personally know yourself, that you're not going to freeze up,\" Lance Cpl. Matthew Jenkins said after Mullen's speech.  \"We'll see how I react when it goes down in a couple weeks,\" said Lance Cpl. Joshua Williamson.  Questions remain, however, about how so many Marines without combat experience in Afghanistan can jump into a heated combat zone.  Mullen admitted some concerns.  \"We're obviously not in an ideal situation with respect to that. I understand that, but I have a huge amount of confidence in our Marine Corps based on their ability to adapt, what they did in Iraq,\" he said.  There seems to be little worry among unit leaders in the 3/2nd LAR, who have been training and watching their troops grow in skills and confidence in recent months.  \"One thing about the Marine Corps is that you always have experience wherever you go,\" Auer said.  \"So we've got Marines that have done deployments before and the training they have given me, I'm confident to where I can lead my platoon, but I'm also relying on staff NCOs (non-commissioned officers) that have years of experience.  \"That experience we have from the different deployments in Iraq, I'm relying on all the NCOs to carry their weight, and with that I don't think there is anything that can get in our way,\" Auer continued.  For the families of these Marines, deployments are never easy, especially when they know that their husbands and wives are moving to a region known for its hostility.  \"I'm glad he's going where he's needed. It would be a waste for him to go where he's not needed and not be able to do his job,\" said Kim Durbin, wife of deploying Marine Lt. Dan Durbin.  \"It's just not him in the Marine Corps, it's our family, and we are proud to be a part of it,\" she said.  Kim Durbin and her three kids, ages 1, 3 and 5, will watch Dan Durbin leave for Helmand province on his first combat deployment in a few weeks.  She appears strong for a young mother, but all the preparations a family does can sometimes bury reality.  \"Well we're thankful he's going to be with us for Christmas, so we just want to enjoy the time we have together.\"  But Kim Durbin's eyes close, and she fights back tears that become a sob.  \"I think when we actually say goodbye, it's going to be hard, but we'll get through it, and we want to enjoy the time we do have together,\" she said.  Families on this base are their own support system. Wives of Marines with husbands who have deployed numerous times help younger families get through the first deployments.  \"It's very difficult, I think, for people outside the military community to understand what they have to go through,\" said Marine Capt. Eric Maedor, who returned from his third combat deployment to Afghanistan weeks ago.  His wife, Teresa Maedor, a veteran of keeping the family together while Eric is away, agrees.  \"I don't think when you have 'X' number of deployments under your belt that it makes it any easier; you just know what to expect. You know what to expect next time as far as how you need to manage things. Sometimes you worry about them more; sometimes you worry about them less,\" she said.", "Q": ["Q: Who is sending the marines? A:", "Q: Where are marines being sent?

{"article": "  -- Seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher could be set to make a shock return to Formula One as Ferrari look for a short-term replacement for the injured Felipe Massa.  Michael Schumacher remains very much part of the Ferrari set-up as an advisor for the Formula One team.  The 28-year-old Brazilian is currently in intensive care at the AEK military hospital in Budapest after suffering a fractured skull in a freak accident in qualifying for Saturday's Hungarian Grand Prix.  Massa's condition has improved in the past 24 hours with doctors taking him out of a medically-induced coma on Monday night.  He has since responded well to questions and Peter Bazso, the medical director of the hospital, claimed on Tuesday morning that Massa might be able to walk out of the hospital in 10 days' time.  Felipe Massa's crash in pictures. \u00bb  \"My expectation is that he would walk out of the hospital on his own. If his recovery continues, I wouldn't rule out that he could leave within 10 days,\" Bazso told Hungarian TV channel M1.  \"He's spending more and more time awake, talking to family and friends. I would like to point out that, although he is recovering, this is not the end of the story, he is still in a life-threatening condition. Of course, the danger is decreasing by the day.\"  While the news regarding Massa's condition continues to be encouraging, behind the scenes Ferrari are faced with the task of finding a replacement driver.  Doctors have said Massa will be out for at least six weeks, although there are still fears he may never return as a result of his injuries.  He will certainly miss the European and Belgian Grands Prix at the end of August, although the current four-week break before the next race in Valencia gives the Italian team time to assess their options.  On the list of likely replacements could be Schumacher -- who won five of his drivers' titles with Ferrari and works as an advisor for the team.  The 40-year-old German's representative Sabine Kehm told CNN: \"There is no offer from Ferrari, but if they decided they need him, Michael would certainly weigh his options.\"  Ferrari spokesman Luca Colajanni later confirmed to the Press Association that Schumacher, who retired in 2006, was an option.  \"We have said before that it is possible that Michael Schumacher could return to help us out,\" said Colajanni. \"However, we have two test drivers at Ferrari (Luca Badoer and Marc Gene) at the moment and Michael is an advisor.  Does safety need to be improved in Formula One?  \"We have not spoken to him and we will have to wait and see what happens. It is something for (Ferrari team principal) Stefano Domenicali to consider over the coming weeks.  \"We need to see how Felipe is and the situation will evolve from there. We are not in any hurry, the first and foremost thing is Felipe's recovery.\"  Colajanni also provided further encouraging news regarding Massa, although he played down Bazso's assertion that he could walk out of hospital as early as next week.  \"I think that on Monday he improved a lot but we have to remain cautious,\" he said. \"It is not useful to put forecasts on these things. I think for the moment we should just enjoy the positive improvements that Felipe is making.\"  Massa was hurt when a spring that had fallen from the back of Rubens Barrichello's Brawn GP car struck him on the helmet at high-speed, causing him to lose control of his car and crash into a tire barrier.  On Monday, Professor Robert Veres, the surgeon who operated on Massa over the weekend, told reporters that Massa had suffered some damage to his left eye, which could threaten his future in the sport.  \"It's too early to say about his future as we don't know the extent of the damage. Without an operation it's very hard to evaluate the eye's function,\" said Vares.  Massa's crash came less than a week after Formula Two driver Henry Surtees, the son of former world champion John Surtees, was killed in similar circumstances, knocked unconscious by a tire which flew off another car in a race at Brands Hatch in England, before crashing.  Formula One's safety record has improved dramatically in recent years, with the last fatality in 1994 when the legendary Brazilian Ayrton Senna crashed at Imola.", "Q": ["Q: When was the crash A:", "Q: what is massa's condition A:", "Q: Name the short-term replacement for Felipe Massa A:", "Q: What champion may return to Formula One A:", "Q: what is the name of the injured driver?

{"article": "WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- A form of liquid morphine used by terminally ill patients will remain on the market even though it is an \"unapproved drug,\" according to a decision by the Food and Drug Administration.  Last month, the FDA warned nine companies to stop selling unapproved pain-relief drugs.  After talking with hospital and hospice organizations, which expressed concern that taking the product off the market would result in hardship for terminally ill patients and their caregivers, the agency decided to extend the usage of morphine sulfate oral solution 20 mg/ml.  The agency wants to ensure there is no shortage of the drug while patients wait for an approved product to take its place.  \"While the FDA remains committed to ultimately ensuring that all prescription drugs on the market are FDA approved, we have to balance that goal with flexibility and compassion for patients who have a few alternatives for the alleviation of their pain,\" Dr. Douglas Throckmorton, deputy director of the FDA's Center for drug Evaluation and Research, said Thursday.  \"In light of the concerns raised by these patients and their health-care providers, we have adjusted our actions with regard to these particular products.\"  Last month, the FDA sent warning letters to nine companies telling them to stop manufacturing 14 unapproved narcotics that are widely used to treat pain.  Seven of those companies made or distributed the oral morphine.  The morphine elixir is widely used by terminal patients in hospital and home hospice care settings and is manufactured by Lehigh Valley Technologies Inc., Mallinckrodt Inc. Pharmaceuticals Group, Boehringer Ingelheim Roxane Inc. and Cody Laboratories, Inc.  In its warning letter last month, the agency gave the companies 60 days to stop manufacturing the drug before enforcement action was taken.  Thursday's announcement did not prompt immediate reactions from the companies. A spokesman for Cody Laboratories said the firm did not have all the details of the decision. Other companies did not immediately return calls from CNN.  The FDA estimates there are several thousand drugs, mostly older products, marketed illegally without FDA approval in this country. Once an illegally marketed drug is identified, enforcement action begins because the agency does not have information on the quality of these drugs and has not had an opportunity to approve their labeling. In 1976 the agency began a program to bring companies manufacturing these drugs into compliance.  Thursday's announcement applies only to the morphine sulfate elixir 20mg/ml, and the warning letters sent to the other product manufacturers are still in effect.  Currently there are no approved morphine sulfate oral solution 20mg/ml products on the market. Until there are, the FDA says it will allow companies making and distributing the unapproved drugs to continue, until 180 days after any company receives approval to manufacture a new morphine replacement drug of the same dosage.  The FDA says it expects all companies marketing unapproved drugs to submit the necessary applications to get approval for those drugs.", "Q": ["Q: what did fda decide A:", "Q: What alternatives are being developed?

{"article": " -- Treasure hunter Christian Hanisch told CNN Thursday that the hunt for Nazi Gold and possibly the legendary Amber Room will end Friday after the two men leading the expedition had a disagreement.  Treasure hunters began drilling again Tuesday to try to locate the lost Nazi gold.  Heinz-Peter Haustein, the other treasure hunter, told Germany's Bild newspaper that geophysicists will now re-evaluate the situation and that digging may resume in two weeks. CNN has so far not been able to reach Haustein for confirmation.  \"Haustein told me to get out of here immediately,\" an angry Hanisch told CNN in a telephone interview.  He said Haustein, who is also the mayor of the village Deutschneudorf, where the digging is taking place, told him he wanted to make the expedition more credible by calling in the scientists.  See photos from hunt for lost Nazi gold \u00bb  \"It can't get any more credible than now,\" said Hanisch, whose measurements had allegedly pinpointed the treasure.  He said the drilling taking place at the site never focused on the exact coordinates he had provided. \"They just always dug around there, but never at the exact location where I wanted them to dig,\" he said.  The two treasure hunters had said geological surveying had revealed an underground cave holding large amounts of precious metal. They said it could be a holding area dug by the Nazis who used it to stash valuables in World War II.  Haustein said he also believes the legendary Amber Room, an interior made of gold and amber that the Nazis had looted from a palace in St. Petersburg,  after Adolf Hitler's forces invaded the Soviet Union in 1941, was also hidden somewhere in the mountains around Deutschneudorf -- and that finding a stash of gold could give clues as to the whereabouts of the Amber Room.  Now Hanisch says he never believed in the Amber Room theory. \"I never talked about finding the Amber Room anywhere here, that was all Haustein's idea,\" he said.  Hanisch said that his father was one of the soldiers who helped transport gold and other valuables to the area around Deutschneudorf near the end of the Second World War and that when he died he left behind coordinates allegedly leading to a cave holding gold and other valuables.  Haustein has been paying for the excavation.  Watch hunt for Nazi gold at German mountain \u00bb  Earlier this week, Haustein said digging at the site was stopped more than a week ago amid safety concerns, as German authorities and the treasure hunters feared that the shaft dug so far might collapse, and that the alleged cave may be rigged with explosives or poisonous booby traps.  Deutschneudorf is in Germany's Ore Mountains, and the mountain where the treasure hunters were looking was a copper mine until the 19th century. Though the mine was shut down in 1882, geologists have found evidence that soldiers from Hitler's Wehrmacht -- the German armed forces -- had been there: machine guns, parts of uniforms and explosives that are on display at the town's museum.

The Consumer Product Safety Commission uses mannequins to show the dangers of fireworks.  That was the message from the Consumer Product Safety Commission Tuesday, which put out an early July Fourth holiday warning urging families to put safety first when celebrating with fireworks.  \"We know that 70 percent of all [fireworks-related] accidents occur between June 20 and July 20,\" commission head Inez Tenenbaum said during a demonstration of fireworks safety on the National Mall.  \"This is the time of year that people are using fireworks.\"  Tenenbaum noted that the largest number of young people injured by fireworks are between the ages of 14 to 17.

Watch the CPSC warnings about fireworks \u00bb  \"Never pick up a firework that is a dud [and] hasn't fired, because it might go off in your hand,\" she added.

Using mannequins posed in typical outdoor settings, the technicians showed how a simple sparkler often used by children can easily cause clothing to catch fire. They also demonstrated the explosive power of cherry bombs, among other things, using them to blow up large watermelons.  In another setting, they showed how professional-grade and illegal fireworks often use faster-burning fuses, which do not give the person lighting enough time to get away.  \"Parents need to exercise caution and make certain they're buying fireworks that comply with their state and local and county ordinances,\" Tenenbaum warned.", "Q": ["Q: What is the largest age group that gets injured?

{"article": "Jerusalem (CNN) -- As a deadline neared, Israel handed the United Nations Friday a report justifying its actions during last year's Gaza campaign and rebutting the so-called \"Goldstone Report\" as biased.  At a tree-planting ceremony southern Israel Friday, Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak said, \"This report stresses that the IDF (Israel Defense Forces) is like no other army, both from a moral standpoint as well as from a professional standpoint.  \"The Goldstone Report is a distorted, false, and irresponsible report,\" Barak said. \"All of the soldiers and officers whom we sent to battle need to know that the state of Israel stands behind them even on the day after.\"  \"The Gaza Operation Investigations: An Update\" -- a follow-up of a July paper on the Gaza mission -- is in response to the United Nations' call for both the Jewish state and the Palestinian Hamas movement to conduct independent inquiries to examine charges that both sides committed war crimes during the course of the Gaza war fought just over a year ago.  Israel's 46-page response outlines the steps the nation has taken to investigate charges of wrongdoing by its military during the course of its three-week offensive -- dubbed Operation Cast Lead -- in Gaza aimed at stopping militant rocket fire into Israel.  Israel says it faced \"asymmetric conflicts\" and blamed \"militants operating from within and behind civilian areas\" for placing civilians at risk.  The Israeli military has \"launched investigations into 150 separate incidents, including 36 criminal investigations opened thus far,\" according to the report.  \"Israel is committed to ensuring that every such incident is fully and fairly investigated, to ensure that lessons can be learned and that, if justified, criminal or disciplinary proceedings initiated,\" the report stated. \"To this end the IDF policy requires that every allegation of wrongdoing be investigated, irrespective of its source.\"  The report does not mention whether Israel will conduct an independent, non-military investigation of the charges of war crimes and possible crimes against humanity leveled in the Goldstone Report.  Released in September, the 575-page report written by a commission chaired by South African Judge Richard Goldstone alleged that both Hamas and Israel committed war crimes and may have also committed crimes against humanity during the course of fighting that killed some 1,400 Palestinians and 13 Israelis.  The majority of criticism in the report was reserved for Israel which has waged an aggressive international public relations campaign to discredit the probe's findings.  With the publication of the report, the United Nations asked both Israel and Hamas to initiate independent investigations into the the various allegations and report back before February 5 when the General Assembly will be taking up the report and its recommendations.  Among those recommendations were the call for the report's findings to be passed on to the International Criminal Court if both sides did not start legitimate investigations into war crimes.  In Israel, the military has conducted investigations into possible wrong-doing itself which has raised criticism from human rights groups and some Israeli lawmakers that a more credible investigation is needed.  Israel's outgoing attorney-general Menachem Mazuz told the Haaretz newspaper Friday \"Israel has a clear interest in conducting a serious, expert examination that will deal with the (Goldstone) report and produce an opposing report.\"  In Gaza, the ruling Hamas movement this week released a 20-page summary of the steps it has taken to investigate wrong-doing, contending it had prevented militants from rocketing Israeli civilians and that any examples to the contrary were a result of mistaken fire.  It was a claim quickly dismissed by the by human rights organizations and the Israeli government.  \"Hamas can spin the story and deny the evidence, but hundreds of rockets rained down on civilian areas in Israel where no military installations were located,\" Joe Stork, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch said in a statement. \"Hamas leaders at the time indicated they were intending to harm civilians.\"", "Q": ["Q: Who did the U.N. accuse of actions amounting to war crimes?

Germany and Israel are linked \"in a very special way\" by the memory of the Holocaust, in which 6 million Jews were killed under Nazi Germany and its allies in World War II, she said in the first address a German chancellor has ever made to the Knesset.  \"The Holocaust fills us with shame,\" she said. \"I bow my head before the survivors and I bow my head before you in tribute to the fact that you were able to survive.\"  Anti-Semitism, racism and xenophobia \"must never take root again in Germany or in Europe,\" she said, and vowed to battle any flare-ups.

The German Chancellor called on him to prove that he does not want a nuclear bomb.  Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has said his country's nuclear program is intended for peaceful purposes only, but Merkel told the Israeli parliament that he needs to provide clear evidence supporting that assertion.  \"It is not the world that has to prove that Iran is building a bomb,\" she said. \"Rather, Iran has to prove to the world that it does not want the nuclear bomb.\"  Ahmadinejad has also said Israel should not exist as a sovereign nation, but Merkel said Israel's right to exist is not open to negotiation. \"These are not just empty words,\" she said, adding that Germany would support further sanctions on Iran if it fails to cooperate.  \"What do we do when a majority says the greatest threat to the world comes from Israel and not from Iran?\" she asked. \"Do we bow our heads? Do we give up our efforts to combat the Iranian threat?

{"article": " -- Nigerian footballer Stephen Worgu has been sentenced to 40 lashes after he was convicted of drinking alcohol in Sudan where he plays for first division side Al-Merreikh of Omdurman.  The 20-year-old forward, who joined the northern Sudan outfit in October 2008, was found guilty of drinking alcohol and driving under the influence by an east Khartoum court.  Alcohol is illegal in the Muslim north of Sudan according to Article 78 of the penal code, although it is not in the semi-autonomous and largely non-Muslim south.  The court ordered Worgu to pay a fine of $20 for the alcohol consumption, $80 for driving under the influence as well as receiving 40 lashes for the incident which is said to have taken place in the capital Khartoum on August 21.  The forward's lawyer has appealed against the punishment for the player who had previously admitted in interviews that he had struggled to adapt to the different culture and religious life in Sudan.  Worgu, who has been a regular for the Nigerian Under-20 side, had moved to Al-Merreikh for $2.6 million from Enyimba in Nigeria ahead of Egyptian side Al-Ahly in what was one of the biggest transfers in African football.  He had previously been the top scorer in the African Champions League in 2008 after he found the net 13 times but has largely struggled to recapture that form at Al-Merreikh.", "Q": ["Q: How many lashes will the Nigeria footballer receive?

{"article": " -- Debbie Phelps, the mother of swimming star Michael Phelps, who won a record eight gold medals in Beijing, is the author of a new memoir, \"A Mother For All Seasons.\"  Debbie Phelps, mother of Olympian Michael Phelps, tells Larry King her son has strong values.  Phelps spoke with CNN's Larry King about her new book, a recent tabloid report detailing her son's partying ways and the infamous bong photo.  The following is an edited version of the transcript.  Larry King: You have this terrific new book coming. If I do say so myself, it's inspiring. Yet (Thursday's) lead story in the \"New York Daily News\" gate crasher column -- I don't know who writes that -- \"tsk, tsk,\" it says, \"Michael Phelps, partying your face off in public is not the way to reclaim your good guy image. The Olympian was been laying relatively low since his bong smoking scandal in January was out in full force Tuesday night at New York City hot spot Marquis\" -- I think is the name -- \"Michael was definitely having a good time, an eyewitness tells us, drinking straight from a bottle of Grey Goose. When the DJ started playing MIA's 'Paper Planes,' he got up started dancing like a loon and kept on yelling 'shots.' Phelps definitely had enough alcohol on hand for several four round. He ordered four bottles of Vodka.\"  Is this tough for a mother? How do you react?  Debbie Phelps: It's one thing that I learn at a very early age is I don't get caught up in gossip columns. I know my son. He has great values, lots of integrity. That's what I think about that.  King: Did you talk to him about this?  Phelps: I always talk to Michael. I talk to Michael every day. We talked about training today and things of that nature.  King: But it would be normal to say, what happened, wouldn't it? I would say that to my son.  Phelps: We give support. We give guidance. We give an ear to listen. And, again, I don't get caught up in gossip.  King: Therefore, you don't believe it? I just want to establish what your feelings are.  Phelps: I don't get caught up in gossip, Mr. King.  King: What about something that wasn't gossip, the picture with the bong thing. It was a picture.  Phelps: It's a picture, that's true. But, you know, a picture can say many things. It has many words. It has many meanings. It has many visualizations that you want to think. It depends on the person who is looking at that picture.  You know, as a mom, I support all three of my children. I believe that no matter who you are in this country, in this world, there are obstacles that get into your life. I call them speed bumps in school sometimes. I heard someone say lightning bolts. That's another term for that.  But, you know, how do we grow? How do we learn? You raise a child through 18. You send them off to college. You give them the roots. You give them the foundation to be a strong, young man, a strong lady. Life throws curve balls to you sometimes. How do you handle that curve ball?  King: Michael is 23. That's an adult. He's an adult.  Phelps: A young adult.  King: Young adult. So one could say it's his life. He chooses to lead it. As our parent, we do our best to guide them, but 23 is 23. Do you view him still as a kid?  Phelps: I view my 31-year-old daughter as a kid sometimes. You know, I look at each of my children independently and individually of themselves. They have many strong values, strong points, professionalism. I'm just very proud of all three of them and everything they've done.  King: Do you think these kind of stories -- and you don't pay attention to them -- hurt your book?  Phelps: I was asked many times and told many times, \"Debbie, you need to write a book some day.\" As an educator, I'm thinking, I would really like to do that. It became a personal goal of mine to be able to publish a book, not knowing exactly what it was going to be.  Was it going to be my life? Was it going to be parenting? Was it going to be swimming? Was it just going to be motivational and inspirational? When I take a look at the book I was able to write, I have great pride in that book because it shows other people, every woman, but not even women -- men can read this book also -- the inspiration and motivation of life.  King: The question is, \"Do you think these kind of stories might hurt the chance of people buying the book, which is what you want?\"  Phelps: People are going to have to make that decision.  King: Do you think it might?  Phelps: Life is life. I do want to say, though, in reference to the Beijing Olympics, we, as a family, I think, made a great impression on the world, on the United States. My son has great love for me. It's a great bonding relationship. Families are very important.  King: Is he still a role model, do you think?  Phelps: You know, when I think of the word role model, I'll go back to me being a little girl. It was my mom and my dad. They were my role models when I was growing up. When I hear that role model in a sentence with my son, what I think about with Michael is what he does with and for children. It might be things people don't even know of -- his association with the Boys and Girls Club. For years, he has done that (and) his association with Make A Wish.  He touches kids' lives. So if an individual, wherever they may be, may select my son as a role model, I say that my son has strong values. I say he's a human being. And I say that from obstacles that get in people's ways -- we all have them, Mr. King, and you know that -- what do you learn from them and how do you rise above the occasion?", "Q": ["Q: What was Michael Phelps seen doing in NY?

{"article": "Editor's Note: John Kerry, a Democrat, is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the junior senator from Massachusetts.  John Kerry says Barack Obama sent a message that fight against terror will respect America's values.  WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Thursday was an important day for the rule of law in the United States of America.  With a handful of signatures to executive orders, President Obama ordered the eventual closure of Guantanamo Bay prison and CIA \"black site\" prisons, and placed interrogation in all American facilities by all U.S. personnel under the guidelines of the Army Field Manual.  In a season of transformational changes, these are among the most meaningful, because they send a powerful message that America's struggle against terrorism will once against honor some of the most cherished ideals of our republic: respect for the rule of law, individual rights, and America's moral leadership.  The president understands all too well that the threat our nation faces from terrorism is all too real. And we should all agree that sometimes, in the name of national security, it is necessary to make difficult ethical decisions to protect the American people.  However, I and many others believe that the use of torture and indefinite detention have not only tarnished our honor but also diminished our security.  In this global counterinsurgency effort against al Qaeda and its allies, too often our means have undercut our efforts by wasting one of our best weapons: the legitimacy that comes from our moral authority.  Torture plays directly into a central tenet of al Qaeda's recruiting pitch: that everyday Muslims across the world have something to fear from the United States of America.  From Morocco to Malaysia, people regularly hear stories of torture and suicide at Abu Ghraib, Guantanamo, and other overseas prisons. The result has been a major blow to our credibility worldwide, particularly where we need it most: in the Muslim world.  Once permitted, torture and lawlessness are not easily contained. Coercive interrogation techniques found their way from high-level terrorists at Guantanamo to low-level detainees at Abu Ghraib.  Years later, images of abuse there remain fixtures across the Arab and Muslim world. And as John McCain has argued, the use of techniques like waterboarding leaves its scars on a democratic society as well.  Torture elicits lies -- not just from those experiencing it, but from those who seek to conceal it. After years of Orwellian denials and legalistic parsing, what a relief it was to hear our new attorney general-designee finally acknowledge what we know to be true: that yes, \"waterboarding is torture.\"  As we move forward, President Obama is wise to \"reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals\" -- but the American people should know that closing a prison conceived outside the rule of law will not be easy.  Reclaiming Guantanamo and its inhabitants into our legal system from what former Vice President Dick Cheney called \"the dark side\" will be an enormous challenge and a thicket of thorny legal and policy issues.  However, we are already seeing the international system reorganize itself around an America that is willing to be a moral leader. Countries such as Portugal and Ireland have made welcome offers to join Albania in resettling detainees who cannot be returned to their home countries. Already we are seeing the fruits of a good faith effort with our allies.  Still, it will take time and effort to overcome numerous hurdles, many handed over from the previous administration: looming questions about the inadmissibility of evidence improperly coerced; the difficulty of returning detainees -- including many cleared for departure -- who would face torture or worse in their home countries; and the fact that we already know some released from Guantanamo have returned to the battlefield.  In some cases we simply lack evidence to charge men we know to be extremely dangerous to the American people.  And even as we embrace long-overdue change, we owe it even to those we believe made grave mistakes to acknowledge the urgency of the moment they inherited, the sacred responsibility to protect American lives which they strove to honor, and the humbling reality that there are no easy answers when it comes to such life-and-death matters.  But the American story is one of perfectibility and striving for ever-greater fidelity to our ideals -- it is a journey from colony to republic, from slavery to freedom, from sexism to suffrage, from stark poverty to shared prosperity. The president himself famously said, \"The union may never be perfect, but generation after generation has shown that it can always be perfected.\"  It is true that today we face unprecedented, unorthodox, and vastly destructive enemies that respect neither borders nor rules of war. But this is not the first new challenge America has evolved to meet. Sometimes that evolution requires us to admit mistakes, learn from them and grow as a nation.  The desire to do better has always been a core part of America's greatness. Last week Barack Obama and his administration wrote a new chapter in that old story.

{"article": "JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (CNN) -- South Africa's police chief said Monday that violence directed at foreign nationals had killed 22 people over the past week.  Police carry an unidentified Malawi national on an improvised stretcher after he was badly beaten in Reiger Park township.  The attacks have been concentrated in Johannesburg's poorest areas, and many of the victims were Zimbabweans who have fled repression and dire economic circumstances.  The Nelson Mandela Foundation issued a statement condemning the \"senseless violence\" that police say was sparked a week ago in Johannesburg's Alexandra Township.  \"We join the rest of South Africa in deploring this violence,\" said Achmat Dangor, CEO of the Nelson Mandela Foundation, according to a statement released on Monday.  \"Whatever the underlying causes they have to be addressed, but this senseless violence is not a solution.\"  Police said those behind the attacks accused the foreigners of stealing jobs, carrying out criminal activities and benefiting from social services -- such as free housing -- meant to benefit South Africans. iReport.com: Are you there? Send photos, video  Police arrested more than 200 people during the violence for offenses including rape, murder, robbery and theft.  Police said at least one foreigner was burned alive over the weekend, while others had their houses torched, their shops looted and their possessions stolen. Many have sought refuge at police stations.  Some women have told police they were raped as part of an effort to drive the immigrants out.  South Africa's police director Govindsamy Mariemuthoo said 22 people had been killed in the past week. The Red Cross estimates some 3,000 more were displaced.  The attacks were concentrated in some of the poorest parts of South Africa where locals are jobless, hungry and in need of basic services such as clean water, sanitation and housing.  South African President Thabo Mbeki called for an investigation into the violence. He has been reluctant to describe it as xenophobic because many South Africans have criticized his government for not doing enough to deal with the crisis in neighboring Zimbabwe.  Zimbabwe is in the midst of an economic collapse, with nearly 80 percent unemployment and inflation estimated to be at 160,000 percent.  In addition, it is also in a state of political limbo. A presidential runoff between long-time leader President Robert Mugabe and his opposition challenger Morgan Tsvangirai is scheduled for June 27 -- three months after the initial vote.  Opposition leaders have accused the government of carrying out a campaign of political intimidation ahead of the runoff.  The economic and political situation has seen an influx of Zimbabweans to South Africa, seeking a better life.  Archbishop Desmond Tutu also condemned the violence and urged South Africans to remember the help that he and other anti-apartheid leaders received from neighboring countries.  \"Although they were poor, they welcomed us South Africans as refugees, and allowed our liberation movements to have bases in their territory even if it meant those countries were going to be attacked by the SADF (South African Defense Forces),\" Tutu said.  \"Please stop the violence now. This is not how we behave. These are our sisters and brothers. Please, please stop.\"  A South African military veterans' group plans to mobilize soldiers who fought against the country's former system of legalized racial separation \"to help educate the people... about the role played by other African countries in securing South Africa's freedom.\"  \"Many brave comrades paid the ultimate price on African soil, but never at the hands of the people of those countries,\" according to a statement from the Military Veterans' Association in the Western Cape province.  \"In the light of these facts, the xenophobic attacks witnessed in Gauteng (Province) over the past week -- and previously, against refugee traders in Cape Town -- are totally repugnant.\"", "Q": ["Q: Were were zimbabweans fleeing from?

U.S. Marines fire 120mm mortars on Taliban positions on April 3 in Now Zad in Helmand province, Afghanistan.  The incident occurred south of Kabul in the eastern Afghan province of Logar, when Afghan security forces and ISAF troops were conducting an operation.  It comes as NATO members meet in Europe to discuss the fight against the Taliban and al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and as human rights groups this week urged NATO and the U.S. military to avoid civilian casualties and develop a well-coordinated condolence payment system for civilians victimized in the war.  Troops saw a large group of insurgents placing a roadside bomb. The militants retreated to a compound and attacked ISAF troops with small arms.  Troops surrounded the compound and urged them to surrender peacefully after it was cordoned off. It also asked the people in the compound to release women and children but no civilians left.  Troops assaulted the compound and 12 male insurgents were killed in gunfire. Troops found one woman who was killed in the crossfire by insurgent small arms fire, ISAF said.  An investigation is being conducted by Afghan National Security Forces at the site. Initial indications show that the woman was killed by insurgent small arms fire.  Eight AK47 rifles, two rocket propelled grenade launchers, several rocket canisters, 82mm mortars, and two heavy machine guns were found in the compound.  \"ANSF and ISAF are making significant progress against insurgent groups in Logar province who are involved in murdering civilians with IEDs,\" said Brig. Gen. Richard Blanchette, ISAF spokesman.  \"Today's firefight illustrates the difference between ISAF troops who risk their lives to protect civilians, and insurgents who deliberately and tragically place civilians at risk.\"  Also, ISAF reported the death of a soldier from the NATO-led force Friday in eastern Afghanistan.  The soldier died of wounds and another was injured after what was described as a \"hostile incident.\"  \"On behalf of the men and women of the International Security Assistance Force, I offer our heartfelt condolences to the loved ones of the brave soldier killed, and our support to the soldier wounded in this incident,\" Blanchette said.  \"As we recognize their sacrifice in our battle against a vicious insurgency, we will continue supporting the Afghan National Security Forces so that the Afghan people reap the tangible benefits of peace in their day-to-day lives.\"  Overnight in the southern Afghan province of Helmand, troops killed four militants in an operation targeting a mid-level Taliban commander responsible for attacks against Afghan civilians and coalition forces.

{"article": " -- Many skiers who visit Colorado prefer the slopes of Aspen, Vail or Breckenridge. But there's a cool little day trip from Denver that often gets overlooked by out-of-towners.  The Ski Train begins its round-trip journey to Winter Park at Union Station in Denver, Colorado.  The Ski Train is a 68-year-old local favorite that shuttles about 750 people between Denver and Winter Park. It runs on weekend days -- leaving Denver's Union Station at 7:15 a.m. -- and begins the return leg nine hours later.  The 56-mile trip takes about two hours each way, and many riders say it's worth the cost to avoid the traffic hassles of the oft-congested I-70.  A roundtrip ticket costs between $49 and $85. There are additional expenses, such as parking at the train station in Denver and lift tickets for skiers. If someone chooses to shop instead of ski, a free shuttle into Winter Park is available.  Train riders love the trip route, which winds through the Rockies and climbs to 9,000 feet. It also travels through almost 30 tunnels, including the 6.2-mile Moffat Tunnel, which passes underneath the Continental Divide.  \"The train ride up there is spectacular. You see wonderful vistas as you leave Denver through the northern plains and into the mountains,\" Kristal Kraft, a real estate agent in Denver, says. \"And once you get through the Moffat Tunnel, you're right there at Winter Park.\"  Kraft says she enjoyed her maiden voyage on the train, which came courtesy of a local home builder that bought group tickets in one of the club cars.  \"I loved the convenience [of the train],' she says. \"We relaxed, talked, socialized. And when you get off the train, you are right there at the slopes.\"  According to skitrain.com, three additional cars are available for charter and one for company retreats. The Web site lists the price for the presentation car at $5,000 for a winter trip. The site says the current train cars were purchased after Ansco Investment Company bought the Ski Train in 1988.  Kraft says the cars are comfortably heated and there is ample room to move around. Kraft, an amateur photography buff, enjoyed switching from window to window, side to side, to take pictures.  There is one occasional hitch to riding the train. It shares the track with the Union Pacific Railroad and at times has to stop or pullover to make way for a freight train or Amtrak. And there are instances where another train has an accident.  One time a coal train derailed in a tunnel and the Union Pacific officials told the Ski Train operators it would take two days to clear the tracks, says Ski Train media relations director Jim Bain.  They called the passengers together in a cafeteria in Winter Park and advised them to call friends and family to come pick them up. The company also arranged for a few buses to come gather the remaining passengers and Bain says they were all headed back to Denver by 8:30 p.m.  It was a worst-case scenario, he says, and it only happened once. There are occasional delays of a few hours.  The bad news is you're delayed; the good news is you're on a full service train with food service and restrooms.

{"article": "Editor's note: Jos\u00e9 Miguel Vivanco is executive director of the Americas Division of Human Rights Watch, a nonprofit organization that seeks to protect people's rights. A lawyer from Chile, he was educated there, in Spain and at Harvard Law School.  Jos\u00e9 Miguel Vivanco says conviction of Peru's ex-president is a warning to those who deny human rights.  (CNN) -- Peruvians are celebrating an extraordinary victory this week: the conviction of their former president, Alberto Fujimori, for death squad killings carried out during his rule in the 1990s.  The Peruvian Supreme Court found him guilty of egregious human rights abuses, including the massacre of innocent civilians, and sentenced him to 25 years in prison -- a stiff message to other leaders that justice can eventually catch up to even the most powerful.  It is one of the first times a nation's own independent courts have convicted a former leader for such serious human rights crimes and it sets an important precedent for a region that suffered so much from political violence and rights violations. Equally significant, the ruling came after a lengthy televised trial, which was clearly fair to the defendant -- despite Peru's previous history of authoritarianism and weak rule of law.  Fujimori came to office in 1990 on the promise of crushing a vicious Maoist insurgency but, in the process of restoring order, he corrupted and weakened Peru's most vital government institutions -- including parliament, the courts and law enforcement. Just a few years ago, Fujimori had near-total control of Peru's judiciary.  For a decade, his government used bribery, extortion, and intimidation to concentrate power in the presidency, subverting the democratic process and eliminating normal checks by the judiciary, legislature, and media on government abuses.  He led Peru from 1990 to 2000, presiding over the war with the Shining Path guerrillas and the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement. He was convicted of authorizing killings and kidnappings by paramilitary death squads. Fujimori is to be tried separately on multiple corruption charges.  The landmark decision fits within a global trend of increasing accountability for former heads of state. Just 20 years ago, it was exceedingly rare for even the most brutal leaders to be brought to book. In the late 20th century, Mao Zedong, Idi Amin, Milton Obote, Ferdinand Marcos, Anastasio Somoza, Jean-Claude \"Baby Doc\" Duvalier and Mobutu Sese Seko, to name just a few, were never brought to trial.  Since then, however, the tide has turned. In October 1998, London police arrested General Augusto Pinochet on a warrant from a Spanish judge for human rights crimes. The arrest and the subsequent decisions by the British House of Lords to reject Pinochet's claim of immunity were a wake-up call to tyrants everywhere, but more important, they gave hope to victims elsewhere that they too could bring their tormentors to justice.  In country after country, particularly in Latin America, victims were inspired to challenge the amnesty laws of the 1980s and 1990s that had allowed the perpetrators of atrocities to go unpunished and, often, to remain in power. Thanks to these efforts, former leaders in Argentina, and Uruguay have also faced human rights trials.  Pinochet's arrest also strengthened a nascent international movement -- spurred by the killings in Bosnia and Rwanda, and facilitated by the end of the Cold War -- to make certain the worst abuses are punished.  After the creation of UN tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, the world established the International Criminal Court (ICC) to prosecute genocide, crimes against humanity and serious war crimes when national courts are unable or unwilling to do so.  The ICC is now investigating crimes in the Central African Republic, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and in March the court indicted President Omar al-Bashir of Sudan on charges of crimes against humanity in Darfur.  The Fujimori case stands out, though, because it was Peru's national court system which demonstrated the will, capacity, and independence to try its former president.  A second panel of the Supreme Court will now review an appeal by Fujimori. One can hope the second panel will be as transparent and fair as the first.  Even after this verdict, impunity for past atrocities continues to be a major problem in Peru and throughout the region. It is likely, however, that yesterday's verdict will help give momentum to efforts currently underway in many Latin American countries to bring other human rights violators to justice.  The verdict will also send a powerful message to current heads of state who may be tempted to use abusive tactics to resolve their political problems. As Fujimori discovered yesterday, crimes they may be able to get away with while in power can come back to haunt them years later.

{"article": " -- South African teenager Caster Semenya won the women's 800 meters gold medal at the World Athletics Championships in Berlin, just hours after the sport's governing body asked for the 18-year-old's gender to be verified.  Semenya celebrates her gold, which came just hours after the IAAF called for a gender test on the athlete.  Semenya crushed her rivals by streaking away to secure victory in a time of one minute 55.45 seconds -- the best time in the world this year.  Defending champion Janeth Jepkosgei of Kenya took the silver with Briton Jennifer Meadows claiming bronze.  However, the race was run amid controversy following the announcement by the International Amateur Athletics Federation (IAAF).  Watch outrage over allegations \u00bb  \"The gender verification test is an extremely complex procedure,\" said IAAF spokesman Nick Davies -- who revealed the question of Semenya's gender was first raised after her astonishing African junior championship displays.  \"In the case of this athlete, following her breakthrough in the African junior championships, the rumors, the gossip were starting to build-up,\" Davies added to reporters.  There have been precedents in such cases, the most famous being that of Polish athletics great Stella Walsh, who won Olympic gold in the 100 yards at the 1932 Olympics and silver in the same event in the 1936 Olympics in Berlin.  However, after she was shot dead during an armed robbery in 1980, the subsequent autopsy revealed she possessed male genitalia, although she also had female characteristics as well.  Meanwhile, Yusuf Saad Kamel secured Bahrain's first-ever medal with a superb late surge to claim gold in the men's 1,500 meters.  Kamel, who until 2003 competed for Kenya as Gregory Konchellah and is the son of former two-time world 800m champion Billy, won in a time of three minutes 35.93 seconds.  Ethiopia's world indoor champion Deresse Mekonnen claimed a surprise silver with defending champion Bernard Lagat, also Kenyan-born but now competing for the United States, in bronze.  \"\"It's amazing to win a world title just like my father. The only thing left for me to do is to beat his times and win more medals and get to the front of my family,\" Kamel told reporters.  Olympic silver medallist Asbel Kiprop of Kenya could only finish fourth after leaving himself too much to do down the home straight.  Elsewhere, sprint king Usain Bolt produced an effortless run to coast into the men's 200m final and remain on course to claim a world sprint double to add to his Olympic sprint double from Beijing.  The 22-year-old Jamaican, who set a new world record of 9.58 seconds in winning the 100m on Sunday eased home to win his semifinal in 20.08 seconds and only injury looks like depriving him of gold.  \"I just try and get through and make it as easy as possible,\" Bolt told reporters. \"I've been training for this for a long time now. I know what I have to do.\"  There was more sprint joy for Jamaica when Bolt's compatriot Brigitte Foster-Hylton ran a season's best time of 12.51 seconds to finally claim gold in the women's 100m hurdles.  The 34-year-old, who won world bronze in Helsinki in 2005 and silver in Paris in 2003, secured her first global title by edging out Canada's Olympic bronze medallist Priscilla Lopes-Schliep.  Another Jamaican, Delloreen Ennis-London, took the bronze medal.  However, the biggest cheer of the night at an electric Olympic Stadium was reserved for Germany's Robert Harting, who dramatically won the men's discus gold with his sixth and final throw of 69.43 meters.  Poland's long-time leader Piotr Malachowski won silver with a throw of 69.15m with defending world and Olympic champion Gerd Kanter of Estonia claiming the bronze with 66.88m.

{"article": " -- Mikkel Kessler is the new World Boxing Council (WBC) super-middleweight champion after out-pointing Briton Carl Froch in a bruising encounter in his native Denmark on Saturday night.  Despite being previously unbeaten after 26 fights, the 32-year-old Froch never looked comfortable against his durable opponent, who was given the decision on all three of the judges scorecards after 12 brutal rounds in front of a partisan and passionate crowd at the MCH Messecenter in Herning.  Froch had Kessler on the canvas in the fifth round, but the referee ruled that the Dane had slipped, and the challenger eventually wore the champion down with a combination of hooks and jabs to take the belt by a margin of 117-111, 115-113 and 116-112.  The result means 31-year-old Kessler, who has lost just twice in 45 fights, is a world champion again just five months after losing his World Boxing Association (WBA) title to Andre Ward.  Although gracious in defeat, Froch questioned if the decision would have gone Kessler's way if the fight had taken place in his hometown of Nottingham, England.  \"I feel terrible that I lost my title, absolutely gutted,\" Froch told ringside reporters after the fight.  \"I don't want to make a mockery of anything but I feel if it was at home in my town, the decision would have gone the other way.\"  He added: \"I took some big punches off a big puncher and I've got to give Kessler the credit he deserves.

{"article": "ABECHE, Chad (CNN) -- Most of the 103 children that a French charity attempted to take to France from Chad for adoption are neither Sudanese nor orphans, three international aid agencies reported on Thursday.  Hundreds of women protest child trafficking and shout anti-French slogans Wednesday in Abeche, Chad.  Six members of Zoe's Ark were arrested last week as they tried to put the children on a plane to France, where the charity said host families were waiting to take the children in.  Three French journalists, a seven-member Spanish flight crew and one Belgian were also arrested. Representatives of the journalists and flight crew said they were unaware of problems with Zoe's Ark and thought they were on a humanitarian mission.  Chadian President Idriss Deby hopes the journalists and the flight crew will be freed, his chief of staff, Mahamat Hissene, said Thursday.  The president would legally be able to intervene in the case if it is transferred from a judge in the eastern city of Abeche, where the children were taken, to a judge in N'Djamena, the capital, Hissene said.  The transfer will take place Monday, according to media reports.  The International Red Cross Committee, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and UNICEF said most of the children were living with their families before Zoe's Ark took them.  The charity said the children were Sudanese orphans that it was trying to rescue from a war-torn nation.  The agencies said most of the children also probably come from Chadian villages along Chad's border with Sudan.  The children have been living in an orphanage in Abeche while authorities and aid agencies try to determine their identities.  Watch a report on whether the children are orphans \u00bb  Chadian authorities immediately accused the charity of kidnapping the children and concealing their identities. Chad's interior minister said Zoe's Ark dressed the children in bandages and fake intravenous drips to make them look like refugees who needed medical help.  The charity workers and journalists have been charged with kidnapping and extortion and could face 20 years of hard labor if convicted. The Spaniards and Belgian are charged with complicity.  The Spanish flight crew is innocent and should be released, a company executive said Thursday.  \"We thought we were doing a humanitarian transport,\" said Antoni Cajal, sales director of Spain's Gir Jet charter firm.  \"If an NGO [nongovernmental organization] has done something wrong, it's impossible for us to know.\"  Spain's Foreign Ministry has publicly expressed its disagreement with the charges and has dispatched top diplomats to Chad to try to win the group's release.  Over the weekend, the captain appealed urgently to be rescued, fearing the crew could be harmed or killed, Cajal said.  But the four women and three men are in good condition in custody, Cajal said, based on his conversations with a Spanish consular official who came from Cameroon to Chad and has been able to visit them.  The detention is the first problem of its kind for the company, which hopes government negotiations can resolve the issue, Cajal said.  On its Web site, Zoe's Ark describes itself as a nonprofit organization based in Paris that sends teams of physicians, nurses, firefighters and other specialists to care for children in war zones and place them with families in France, who then apply for asylum on their behalf.  The Red Cross, UNHCR and UNICEF said the 21 girls and 82 boys range in age from about 1 year to about 10, and they are healthy.  The agencies said they have been interviewing the children individually to determine their backgrounds.  \"So far, the interviews carried out with the children -- some of whom could not provide any information due to their young age -- led to the preliminary conclusion that probably 85 come from Chadian villages near the cities of Adre and Tine along the Chadian-Sudanese border,\" the agencies said.  \"Ninety-one children said they had been living with their family, consisting of at least one adult they considered to be their parent,\" the agencies said, adding that interviews with the remaining 12 children were ongoing.  The agencies called their investigation painstaking and challenging because of the number of children, their youth and the situation in the region.  Other French charities earlier had questioned whether Zoe's Ark could legally arrange adoption of children from Darfur, and contacted French authorities, according to French newspapers and The Associated Press.  French authorities have reacted angrily to the Zoe's Ark trip, calling the group's actions \"illegal and irresponsible.\"  The French Foreign Ministry has said the dispute will not affect France's participation in a European peacekeeping force due to be deployed along the border between Chad and Sudan.  In response to the dispute in Chad, the Republic of Congo said late Wednesday it was suspending all international adoptions, The Associated Press reported.  Reporters Without Borders said it will work for the release of the three journalists arrested in Chad.  The organization said photographers Marc Garmirian of the Capa news agency and Jean-Daniel Guillou of the Synchro X agency were on assignment for their news organizations and were not part of the charity's efforts.  The third journalist, Marie-Agnes Peleran of the TV station France 3 Miditerranee, was traveling with the group in a personal capacity, though she carried a camera from her station, Reporters Without Borders said.

Israel is in the 12th day of a military operation against Hamas militants, who have been firing rockets from Gaza into southern Israel.  Al-Douri's 30-minute recorded message was broadcast Wednesday on al-Raei Iraqi satellite television over an old picture of al-Douri, wearing his Iraqi military uniform.  CNN has not been able to independently verify the authenticity of the voice on the tape.  This is not al-Douri's first purported audio message. There have been at least four others over the past three years in addition to a statement attributed to him.  Al-Douri, 66, served as vice-chairman of Hussein's Revolutionary Command Council. He remains at large nearly six years after the war in Iraq began.  He has previously been reported killed and captured, although those reports later turned out to be erroneous.  He was the King of Clubs (No. 6) on the U.S. military's card deck of most wanted regime officials.  The U.S. military says he has helped finance the insurgency against U.S. troops in Iraq with Iraqi funds he transferred to Syria before Hussein's government collapsed in April 2002. But it says his influence has waned while he has been in hiding.  U.S. officials say al-Douri played key roles in the chemical attack on the Kurdish town of Halabja in 1988 and in putting down Kurdish and Shiite revolts after the 1991 Persian Gulf War.", "Q": ["Q: what was Al-Douri A:", "Q: who was vice chairman?

Isabella dethroned Emma as the top name for girls born last year, according to the Social Security Administration's annual list of most popular baby names, released Saturday.  Jacob, on the other hand, held on as the most popular boy's name for the 11th year in a row.  The Social Security Administration started compiling name lists in 1997. And as in years past, the influence of pop culture is reflected in the names picked for newborns.  The boy's name that rocketed up the list the fastest is Cullen -- the name of the lead character in the popular \"Twilight\" book series.  Cullen's girlfriend in the books is Bella, short for Isabella.  On the girls' side, the fastest riser is Maliyah, an altered version of the name of President Obama's daughter Malia -- which also is among the top 10 fast risers.  But parents are equally quick to drop celebrity-inspired names once they think the popularity is passe.  Among the biggest drops last year were Mylee and Miley, as in singer Miley Cyrus.  Also on the outs: Lindsay and Jonas (think actress Lindsay Lohan and the band Jonas Brothers).  Meanwhile, Barack continued to move up the list.

{"article": " -- Kaka underlined his commitment to AC Milan with two goals in a 4-1 Serie A win at Bologna on Sunday when on-loan David Beckham claimed his first goal in Italian football.  Kaka scored twice for AC Milan days after rejecting a world record transfer to Manchester City.  Brazilian star Kaka, playing his first match since the collapse of a  proposed world record transfer to Premier League Manchester City, converted from the penalty spot after 17 minutes and added a spectacular second two minutes before half-time.  Kaka's double took the limelight away from former England captain Beckham who made his mark on the hour as Milan kept up the pressure on top two, city rivals Inter and Turin-based Juventus.  Beckham moved to Milan from Los Angeles Galaxy earlier this month and found the target as coach Carlo Ancelotti marked 400 games in charge of the club.  The former Mancherster United star is clearly enjoying his stay in Italy and there have been suggestions he could extend his stay.  \"I can't say what will happen,\" PA Sport quoted him as saying on Sunday. \"Even if my contract says that I'll be here until March. We'll have to see.  \"At the moment I'm enjoying this experience. I'm at one of the biggest clubs in the world. And having won gives us confidence to continue.\"  He added: \"It's great to score my first goal -- I will keep this jersey. It's special to play for Milan and also to score, but what's most important is that we won.\"  Milan coach Carlo Ancelotti was delighted with Beckham's performance, but insists the club can do nothing to keep him at the San Siro.  However, he claims the 33-year-old holds his future in his own hands. \"If he said 'we'll see' it means he's thinking about staying,\" Ancelotti told Sky Italia. \"However, our hands are tied as he has a clear contract.\"  Bologna took the lead through a Marco Di Vaio penalty after nine minutes and Clarence Seedorf equalised after Kaka's effort had been spilled by goalkeeper Francesco Antonioli.  AS Roma closed to within three points of fourth, the final Champions League qualifying position, with a stunning 3-0 win at Napoli.  Centre-backs Philippe Mexes (18) and Juan (32) gave Roma a two-goal lead at the interval and Montenegro forward Mirko Vucinic added the third four minutes into the second half.  Roma are now only three points behind Genoa who were surprisingly held to a 1-1 home draw by Catania who led through a 67th-minute goal from Jorge Martinez. Diego Milito replied six minutes later.  Roma have won eight of their last 10 Serie A matches following an awful start to the season where they won only two and lost six of their first 10 games.

{"article": " -- John Spieker stood on the back porch of his newly rented Bailey, Colorado, home, thankful for his Good Samaritan landlord and worried that his previous home, parked in the driveway, wouldn't get him to work the next day.  John and Katie Spieker stand next to their camper with baby son, Jacob.  His 1977 Toyota Dolphin camper, which Spieker rescued from a salvage yard, had carried him, his wife, Katie, and 4-month-old son, Jacob, from Florida to Colorado earlier this summer, a cross-country sojourn in search of work.  He was uncertain it could handle the 14-mile commute the next morning, but he'd make do.  \"I'm gonna get up extra early every morning like I have been, and if it [the camper] doesn't get to work, I'm gonna hitchhike,\" Spieker said last week. \"I have a wife and a son to support.\"  Spieker had been making $12 an hour plus commission at his information technology job in Trenton, Florida. Katie was working part-time in a candle shop, and between them they pulled in a little more than $2,500 a month.  But Katie, 21, quit to have the baby, and they moved into a bigger, more expensive house to accommodate their larger family.  As June approached, Spieker, 36, was told his hours and commission were being cut as Florida's economy sank.  \"It got to the point where $6.50 an hour with a house just ain't gonna happen. I was trying to do good for my family, but what can I do?\" he asked. His last day of work in Florida was June 30.  With Florida's unemployment rate at 10.6 percent in June, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, he investigated where prospects might be better, settling on Colorado (7.6 unemployment), and if things didn't work out there, North Dakota (the nation's lowest unemployment at 4.2 percent).  The Spieker family prepared for the trip by holding a yard sale a few days before they were set to leave Trenton, a town of 1,800 near Gainesville. They dutifully cleaned up the home they rented but could no longer afford.  \"You're not going to pay the rent, you get out of the house, you know?\" Spieker said.  They hit the road with $1,000 in cash, a cell phone, some food and what clothing they could fit.  The rickety old camper required some minor repairs along the way: a new battery strap after being bounced around on a rough Alabama highway, some brake work after one stuck near St. Charles, Missouri.  Spieker said he sold wire art in taverns during the journey to earn extra money.  He was teased by opportunities that didn't pan out.  \"I never actually saw this before, but some towns are actually putting billboards up that say 'This town has jobs,' \" he said of his travels through the nation's heartland.  \"I actually went to check it out,\" he said. \"They've got a couple jobs, but nothing really great. They've got some jobs I'm not qualified for, in the medical field,\" he said.  Still without work after arriving in Colorado, the Spiekers lived \"out in the woods\" for a few weeks. They didn't consider themselves homeless, John Spieker said, \"just camping.\"  Using computers at a local office supply store and the library, Spieker and his family have been able to tap private and public assistance to care for themselves.  A local church has taken care of some day-to-day needs.  \"I went down and talked to them and said, 'Hey this is what the situation is, if there's any help available.' They said they could probably help us out with food, baby needs,\" Spieker said.  \"And we're actually going to apply for medical assistance.\"  As for food stamps, Spieker said he'd rather the program be used on the infirm than someone like himself who could provide -- no matter how meager the fixings -- for his family.  \"I'm sure there's other people out there that don't have the motivation or the ability [to work] that can use the food stamps,\" he said.  Katie doesn't fret about the family's circumstances either. She said she leaves \"all the financial details up to John.\"  \"My main job is to take care of Jacob,\" she said.  Life got a bit easier on July 20, when Spieker landed work at an auto parts store. A person he connected with through an online forum offered the Bailey house for $350 a month rent, a $400 discount off the normal price. The home's owner is working a temporary contract construction job on the other side of Colorado, Spieker said, enabling the deal.  But the \"For Sale\" sign out front and real estate agent's lockbox on the front door remind Spieker about how temporary his lodgings may be.  While he's grateful for the auto parts job, nothing is certain there either. A national chain is trying to take over the independent retailer, he said.  \"It's a struggling company,\" Spieker said. \"At the same time, he's busy enough to where he needs three people behind the counter.\"  He's making $10 an hour. But he knows that won't keep his family housed when the cheap rent goes away.  \"At this point we have a place to stay for two or three months. He said 'maybe three, probably two,' \" Spieker said, recounting his landlord's words. \"I like it here. I just need something better-paying,\" he said. If he didn't find something soon, he said, \"At this point, I'll be right back into the same scenario.\" But for the moment, the Spiekers are enjoying what they have.  \"The house is great. It's a one-bedroom, it kind of looks like somebody decided to build an A-frame. It has a really, really nice view,\" Katie said.  Drinking in the surroundings on the back porch, John Spieker agrees.  \"I have the most awesome view,\" Spieker said, looking at the foothills of the Rocky Mountains. \"I can't bring myself to walk off the back porch.\"", "Q": ["Q: Flordia man's pay was reduced why?

{"article": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Every day, five U.S. soldiers try to kill themselves. Before the Iraq war began, that figure was less than one suicide attempt a day.  A U.S. soldier patrols the streets of Baghdad in January.  The dramatic increase is revealed in new U.S. Army figures, which show 2,100 soldiers tried to commit suicide in 2007.  \"Suicide attempts are rising and have risen over the last five years,\" said Col. Elspeth Cameron-Ritchie, an Army psychiatrist.  Concern over the rate of suicide attempts prompted Sen. Jim Webb, D-Virginia, to introduce legislation Thursday to improve the military's suicide-prevention programs.  \"Our troops and their families are under unprecedented levels of stress due to the pace and frequency of more than five years of deployments,\" Webb said in a written statement.  Watch CNN Senior Pentagon Correspondent Jamie McIntyre on the reasons for the increase in suicides \u00bb  Sen. Patty Murray, D-Washington, took to the Senate floor Thursday, urging more help for military members, especially for those returning from war.  \"Our brave service members who face deployment after deployment without the rest, recovery and treatment they need are at the breaking point,\" Murray said.  She said Congress has given \"hundreds of millions of dollars\" to the military to improve its ability to provide mental health treatment, but said it will take more than money to resolve the problem.  \"It takes leadership and it takes a change in the culture of war,\" she said. She said some soldiers had reported receiving nothing more than an 800 number to call for help.  \"Many soldiers need a real person to talk to,\" she said. \"And they need psychiatrists and they need psychologists.\"  According to Army statistics, the incidence of U.S. Army soldiers attempting suicide or inflicting injuries on themselves has skyrocketed in the nearly five years since the start of the Iraq war.  Last year's 2,100 attempted suicides -- an average of more than 5 per day -- compares with about 350 suicide attempts in 2002, the year before the war in Iraq began, according to the Army.  The figures also show the number of suicides by active-duty troops in 2007 may reach an all-time high when the statistics are finalized in March, Army officials said.  The Army lists 89 soldier deaths in 2007 as suicides and is investigating 32 more as possible suicides. Suicide rates already were up in 2006 with 102 deaths, compared with 87 in 2005.  Cameron-Ritchie, the Army psychiatrist, said suicide attempts are usually related to problems with intimate relationships, but they are also related to problems with work, finances and the law.  \"The really tough area here is stigma. We know that soldiers don't want to go seek care. They're tough, they're strong, they don't want to go see a behavioral health-care provider,\" Cameron-Ritchie said.  Multiple deployments and long deployments appear to exact a toll on relationships, thereby boosting the number of suicide attempts, she said.  Traditionally, the suicide rate among military members has been lower than age- and gender-matched civilians. But in recent years the rate has crept up from 12 per 100,000 among the military to 17.5 per 100,000 in 2006, she said. That's still less than the civilian figure of about 20 per 100,000, she said.  The \"typical\" soldier who commits suicide is a member of an infantry unit who uses a firearm to carry out the act, according to the Army.  Post-traumatic stress disorder also may be a factor in suicide attempts, Cameron-Ritchie said, because it can result in broken relationships and often leads to drug and alcohol abuse.  \"The real central issue is relationships. Relationships, relationships, relationships,\" said U.S. Army Chaplain Lt. Col. Ran Dolinger. \"People look at PTSD, they look at length of deployments... but it's that broken relationship that really makes the difference.\"  To reduce suicides, the Army said it is targeting soldiers who are or have been in Iraq for long periods and teaching them to notice signs that can lead to suicide.  That training came too late for Army Specialist Tim Bowman. The 23-year-old killed himself in 2005 after returning from Iraq.  \"As my family was preparing for a 2005 Thanksgiving meal, our son Timothy was lying on the floor, slowly bleeding to death from a self-inflicted gunshot wound,\" said his father, Mike Bowman, in testimony to a House Veterans' Affairs committee hearing in December. \"His war was now over.\"  He said veterans return home to find an \"understaffed, under-funded, under-equipped\" Veterans Affairs mental health system.  \"Many just give up trying,\" he said.

{"article": "LANCASTER, California (CNN) -- The sound of pounding hooves thunders in the high desert air. A cloud of dust marks the trail of a herd of wild horses as they race across the arid plain. This is Lifesavers Wild Horse Rescue, a shelter for wild mustangs and unwanted horses near Lancaster, California.  Jill Starr, president of Lifesavers Wild Horse Rescue, vows to do right by the horses: \"I will take care of them.\"  Lifesavers President Jill Starr says she and other shelter operators are witnessing an equine crisis.  \"People have lost their homes, their jobs, their hope,\" she said. \"And they are giving up their animals.\"  \"We've had horses come onto the property in a horse trailer, unannounced, and just offloaded and [owners] ask us, beg us, if we could take these skinny horses,\" she said.  Starr says she has taken in so many unwanted horses in the past year that her resources are stretched to the breaking point.  Watch rescue center that cares for horses \u00bb  \"All of a sudden it's like somebody flipped a switch and people started bringing back the horses they adopted from us,\" she said.  \"There are no hard numbers on this,\" said Michael Markarian of the Humane Society of the United States. \"The states don't seem to be keeping numbers. The economy has been hard on everybody, and animals are no exception.\"  Shannon Bonfanti is a case in point. A freelance fashion industry worker, Bonfanti says that jobs have dried up, and so has her income.  \"When I was working I was able to take care of all the expenses,\" she said. But she has since decided to sell three of the six horses in her stable -- to save her family as much as $800 a month.  \"How do you sell your kids?\" a tearful Bonfanti asked.  So far, Bonfanti has found no buyers. Not even for Hunni, a horse that has won trophies and ribbons in national riding competitions.  \"I'm willing to take almost any offer,\" Bonfanti said. \"I know my trainer would say I'm crazy. 'You can't give that horse away. She is valuable.' \"  Bonfanti even considered the county animal shelter as a possible solution.  \"I had contacted a few people,\" she said. \"And the factor that there is the possibility that a horse could be put down made me look further.\"  Last year, the Los Angeles County shelter took in 188 abandoned or abused horses -- up 600 percent from the previous year.  Veterinarian David Byerly says the numbers are even worse this year.  \"It has not leveled off in any way,\" Byerly said. \"It just keeps going up.\"  Byerly says that for the first time, the county has had to euthanize abandoned horses because its facilities are full.  Horses considered likely adoption candidates are spared. Even so, the Los Angeles County animal shelter is killing abandoned horses at a rate of three or four a week.  That is not a fate that James Gulledge wants for his horse, Rico.  Gulledge says he first met Rico at the Lifesavers shelter. \"I was volunteering over there and just fell in love with him,\" he said.  But now the economy is forcing some hard choices.  \"I'm very conflicted about it,\" Gulledge said. \"It's just a decision about paying for him or having some money to help some important people make it through all this.\"  Gulledge chose to return Rico to Lifesavers.  For Starr, the horse is one more mouth to feed, and she intends to.  \"I'm hoping that this is the worst of this, that we are going to climb out of this pretty soon,\" she said.  In the meantime, she said, \"I will take care of them and won't let anything bad happen to them.... They're basically family members.\"", "Q": ["Q: What is stretched to the limit?

{"article": "PHOENIX, Arizona (CNN)  -- Jaime Andrade had just gotten out of the shower when the men came to snatch him.  Jaime Andrade was kept in this closet for three days without food or water, police say.  His wife, Araceli Valencia, was mopping the kitchen in their family home on a typical warm spring morning in Phoenix, Arizona, \"when she suddenly felt a hard object pointed to the back of her head and a voice in Spanish tell her not to move,\" according to a Phoenix, Arizona, police investigative report.  \"I told you not to look at me!\" Valencia heard one of the kidnappers bark as he struck Andrade across the head.  Her four children bawling, Valencia was hustled into a bedroom where an armed man fondled her and threatened to rape her if she didn't tell him where Andrade hid his money, according to the report.  After beating and binding Andrade, one of the kidnappers put a gun to Valencia's head. His message: We're taking your husband and SUV. We'll be watching your house. If you call the cops, he's a dead man.  Andrade, his wife would later tell police, was a mechanic and freelance human smuggler, or coyote. Police say his 2006 kidnapping was evidence of a growing trend in Phoenix: drug and human traffickers abducting each other for ransoms or retribution.  Watch why Phoenix is the hotspot \u00bb  The trend continues, as police investigated roughly a kidnapping a day in 2007 and 2008 and are on track to shatter those numbers this year. Police are stingy with details of fresh cases navigating the court system, but recently allowed CNN to review the files from Andrade's kidnapping.  For two and a half days after Andrade's abduction, the kidnappers -- including a man whom Andrade later said had been a friend -- deprived their victim of food and water. Through the door of the closet where he was held, Andrade could hear the cries of other victims being tortured in the house, the report said.  Meanwhile, Valencia had defied the kidnappers and called police, who listened to Andrade \"scream and howl in pain\" over the phone as the kidnappers tried to cut off his ear and a finger. The torture would continue until Valencia came up with the ransom, the kidnappers told her.  Hear Andrade's wife plead with the kidnappers \u00bb  They were true to their word.  Andrade was pistol-whipped and beaten with a baseball bat and the butt of a rifle. The kidnappers tried to gouge out his eye and slashed open his left eyebrow. They burned his back as well -- presumably, police said, with a blowtorch found at the scene. Read how the next door neighbors knew nothing of this  The blindfolded Andrade \"could feel his pants and underwear being cut open by an unknown person,\" he told police. He was told to bend over and was beaten when he refused.  \"Jaime felt his legs being forced apart and heard Aldo say he was going to get his money,\" the report said. The kidnappers then sodomized him with a broomstick, a pair of scissors and a wooden dowel used to hang clothes in a closet.  Kidnappers creative with coercion  Ferocity is often a hallmark of the abductions taking place in this south Arizona city of 1.5 million that serves as a prime transshipment point for drugs and human cargo.  Watch how the kidnappers choose their targets \u00bb  Phoenix police say they have yet to witness the level of violence -- the beheadings, the bodies shoved in drums -- that their counterparts are seeing in Mexico City or the border town of Juarez.  \"It gets close sometimes,\" said Lt. Lauri Burgett, who heads the Home Invasion and Kidnapping Enforcement squad.  Kidnappers will smash their victims' fingers with bricks, snip their backs open with wire cutters, carve them up with knives or simply shoot them.  \"We've had them electrocuted. They set them in a tub with water and use kind of barbaric means and zap the tub. I think it was a battery hooked up,\" Burgett said.  Two kidnappings last year resulted in murders, she added, but it's not the norm.  Phoenix police formed the HIKE squad in October after two years of unprecedented kidnapping numbers -- 357 in 2007 and 368 in 2008 -- gave the city the dubious distinction of being the nation's kidnapping capital. Home invasions were not far behind: 317 in 2007 and 337 in 2008.  See kidnapping numbers since 1999 \u00bb  \"It's all about the money. And there's so much money to be made in this that you can't stop it, but you can try to reveal it, and then you can try to do something about it,\" Burgett said.  The task force has made dozens of arrests, but as of March 31, the city had 101 reported kidnappings. If the trend continues, Phoenix will record an increase in kidnapping for a fourth straight year.  More frustrating is that the numbers represent only a third, maybe less, of the city's kidnappings, said Sgt. Tommy Thompson, a police spokesman with 16 years of drug enforcement experience. Most kidnappings aren't reported, he said, because the victims are generally smugglers, drug dealers or illegal immigrants -- or some combination of the three.  Other criminals targeted  The most common cases are criminal-on-criminal -- drug smugglers or coyotes snatching rivals or their loved ones. In some cases, a drug dealer may have lost a load or failed to make a payment, but there are also cases when kidnappers do it solely for the ransom, which can be between $30,000 and $250,000, Thompson said.  \"[The victims are] wearing the doper bling-bling, and they target them,\" he said. \"We've had several cases where the ransom amount has been $1 million that the person has asked for. In addition to that, they often ask for drugs -- 100 pounds of marijuana, perhaps a pound or two of speed, a pound or two of cocaine or several ounces of heroin.\"  Phoenix police have even arrested victims after rescuing them, Burgett said.  Less frequent but still accounting for 78 kidnappings last year are cases in which coyotes hold their human cargo captive or steal another coyote's patrons, known as pollos (Spanish for chickens), Burgett said.  Burgett said human trafficking is often linked to the drug trade because both industries require the same routes and subterfuge to ferry their wares into the country. See what other cities have a cartel presence  There are rarely \"true victims\" in Phoenix's kidnappings, the lieutenant said.  However, one criminal attorney who has represented at least 10 kidnappers in the last decade insists that the coyote business is \"uglier than the drug trade\" and that pollos are often killed or forced to do coyotes' bidding when they can't come up with the ransoms.  \"In the drug business, the people getting killed are in the business. They are not end users, not consumers,\" said Antonio Bustamente. \"In the coyote business, the people killed are really innocent. [First-time] illegal entry is a petty offense.\"  Though many might debate the innocence of victims entangled in Phoenix's border-related violence, police say there have been instances when the kidnappers snatched the wrong mark.  Girl mistakenly snatched  On the evening of March 17, 2008, a 13-year-old girl and her friend were walking out of a home in the suburb of Avondale. They were planning to play basketball. The friend, according to a police investigative report, was the niece of a man named \"Chucky.\"  Chucky and his cohorts, witnesses told police, had earlier stolen 55 pounds of marijuana and left several men tied up in a vacant house.  Hours later, the investigative report said, armed men arrived at Chucky's sister's house in three vehicles, one a white Chevrolet Tahoe with blue-and-red strobes like the police use.  The men wanted Chucky, their drugs or $24,000. The 13-year-old said she didn't know Chucky. When she tried to walk away, \"one of them grabbed her by the neck, pointed a gun at her and forced her in the vehicle,\" the report said.  Eventually, the men called the girl's mother to demand ransom. A police officer took the phone and informed the men they had the wrong girl. She was released relatively unharmed in the suburb of Surprise.  The case serves as a reminder that as police scramble to tamp the bloodshed before it reaches the levels proliferating south of the border, collateral damage is a reality.  Watch how the kidnapping often occur in quiet neighborhoods \u00bb  The origins of the kidnappers -- 90 percent of whom hail from the Mexican state from which the notorious Sinaloa drug cartel takes its name -- also remind law enforcement that 150 miles south lies a country racked with a more extreme brand of violence.  The tortured Andrade was fortunate that police were able to find him. On Andrade's third day in captivity, an undercover officer posing as a loan shark convinced the kidnappers to lower their ransom from $50,000 to $10,000 and the title to the Ford Expedition they had stolen.  When the kidnappers arrived at the drop point, a Safeway supermarket parking lot, police swarmed on their green Chevrolet Tahoe, the report said. One of the men, Luis Alberto Castro-Vega, then 23, disclosed Andrade's whereabouts after police promised not to charge him with kidnapping.  Only Castro-Vega has been convicted of crimes associated with Andrade's kidnapping: first-degree burglary, theft by extortion, armed robbery and three counts of aggravated assault. In September 2006, a judge sentenced Castro-Vega to 54 years in prison.  Thompson said he hopes the stiff sentence sends a message that Phoenix police expect the kidnappings and violence to end, regardless of the targets and the perpetrators.  \"The problems that occur when it's criminal versus criminal, that's still violence on the streets of America,\" he said. \"If those people get in a gunbattle, those bullets have to go somewhere, and that could be a playground where kids are playing. That could be a neighbor's house where a neighbor is inside sleeping that has nothing to do whatsoever with the illegal activity, but yet they become senseless victims of the violence.\"", "Q": ["Q: Who was tortured for days?

{"article": "She told stories, flirted outrageously with boys and was constantly changing her hairstyle.  Anne Frank hid with her family in a secret room at her father Otto Frank's office in Amsterdam.  It could be the description of almost any young girl growing up in Europe. But this is how Eva Schloss remembers her childhood friend Anne Frank, who had she not died in a Nazi concentration camp, would have celebrated her 80th birthday this week.  Schloss described Frank, whose account of hiding from Jewish persecution in Nazi-occupied Amsterdam is one of the world's mostly widely-read books, as a spunky young schoolgirl with a passion for storytelling that often got her into trouble.  \"She got her diary in 1942, so obviously her father knew she was interested in writing and I know she told stories,\" said Schloss.  \"She talked a lot and she was called Mrs Quack Quack. Very often she used to write hundreds of lines [at school] of 'I'm not going to talk so much,' and so on -- but obviously she had a lot to tell.\"  In some ways the two friends lived parallel lives -- but tragically they had very different outcomes.  Watch more about Schloss' story \u00bb  Schloss and Frank both came from Jewish families who fled to Holland to escape the wave of anti-Semitism spreading across Europe as the Nazis rose to power in Germany ahead of the Second World War.  But while Schloss was more of an introvert, Frank loved the limelight. Schloss said: \"I was actually quite shy and she was the center of attention. We had steps where we sat, and she had a crowd of children around her.  \"She was a big flirt -- she loved boys. She was always showing us who was her boyfriend at that particular time. She was always interested in her clothes. Her style, she always changed it. Sometimes she had curls, then she had straight hair.\"  Schloss says they were unaware of the full scale of what was going on around them as war escalated across Europe, placing their lives in increasing jeopardy.  \"Our parents really protected us so there was no talk about the horrendous things which happened.  \"You couldn't go out anymore after 8 o'clock, but for a 11 to 12 year old it didn't matter so much. Or not going to the cinema -- we were upset about those little things which we couldn't do, but we really didn't really take it seriously at that time.\"  Like Frank, Schloss was also forced into hiding when the Nazis took control of Holland.  Frank hid with her family in a secret room at her father Otto Frank's office. But Schloss and her family had to split up. Schloss stayed with her mother while her father and brother hid elsewhere. She and her mother moved around, staying in seven different hiding places over a two-year period.  Eventually both families were betrayed and were sent to concentration camps, where Frank died at the age of 15.  Schloss said: \"My father and brother were betrayed by a Dutch nurse who was a double agent, and all four of us were arrested and taken to the headquarters to be interrogated.  \"I didn't know anything, which was a good thing. So eventually they realized this and they gave up torturing me. Within two days we were put on a transport to Auschwitz.\"  Of her family, only Schloss and her mother survived Auschwitz, one of the most notorious concentration camps, located in southern Poland.  Today Schloss, who has just celebrated her own 80th birthday, has a husband, three daughters and five grandchildren.  Schloss says it took her decades to rebuild her life, with the help of Frank's father Otto, who also survived incarceration in a concentration camp.  She met Otto in August 1945, when he showed her Frank's diary.  Schloss said: \"He read a few passages but he always burst into tears. It took me 20 years. I was really unhappy, but it was Otto who came to our apartment to talk to us, and he helped me a lot. He had lost everybody.  \"Her book, she [Frank] made people aware of what happened. There are many messages. She believed in the goodness of mankind.  \"People always ask me, what she would have done. I guess we will never know. But I guess she would have gone into politics -- she was a fighter. It's a pity, but also -- maybe her diary would have never been published.\"  CNN's Don Riddell contributed to this story.", "Q": ["Q: Which birthday would Anne Frank be celebrating this week?

{"article": "SEATTLE, Washington (CNN) -- The park bench facing Lake Washington is covered with flowers, poems, a pack of Lucky Strike cigarettes and graffiti.  Fans leave flowers and mementos in honor of Kurt Cobain near his Seattle home.  \"I miss your beautiful face and voice,\" one dedication reads.  \"Thank you for inspiring me,\" says another.  \"RIP Kurt.\"  Fifteen years ago Wednesday, at a house adjacent to the park, Kurt Cobain's dead body was discovered by an electrician.  The Nirvana frontman, 27, had committed suicide, police later ruled, killing himself with a shotgun while high on heroin and pills.  His death ended a battle with hard drugs and added Cobain to a long list of legendary musicians, such as Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin, whose careers were cut short by their addictions.  Cobain's ashes were reportedly scattered in a Washington state river and a New York Buddhist temple.  Nirvana band mates Krist Novoselic and Dave Grohl eventually formed other bands. Cobain's widow, Courtney Love, stayed in the limelight with an acting career and legal problems surrounding her own drug problems. Frances Bean, the couple's daughter, has largely lived outside the public eye.  What was unclear when Cobain died was whether the music Nirvana created would endure or fade away like the grunge craze it helped to inspire.  \"At one point I thought, 15 years on, no one would really know who Kurt Cobain was outside of a group of diehard fans,\" said Jeff Burlingame, a Cobain biographer who grew up with the musician in Aberdeen, Washington, and knew him when he was a teenager who, without a place to sleep, crashed on mutual friends' couches.  But Nirvana's music endured, and Cobain even found fans in his hometown of Aberdeen, which he had derided as a small-minded town.  \"The old-timers who were there when Kurt was around really took offense to some of the things he said about the area, so they had no real reason to honor him,\" said Burlingame, who co-founded the Kurt Cobain Memorial Committee.  A famous son is a famous son, though. Now, visitors arriving in Aberdeen are greeted with a sign that reads \"Come As You Are,\" after a famous Nirvana song.  Cobain Memorial Committee members, who include Cobain's paternal grandfather, hope to establish a community center in the late rocker's honor that would give area youth a place to play music and pursue artistic interests.  A concert will be held Friday in Seattle to honor Cobain and raise money for the center.  When Cobain died, he left behind a fortune that was estimated in the millions.  Even more money poured in over time from the royalties from his songs. But a lawyer hired by Love, Rhonda Holmes, says most of that money is missing.  According to Holmes, Love recently discovered that \"managers, assistants, CPAs, lawyers, people like that who were supposed to be entrusted with carrying for their well-being and finances basically looted the estate.\"  Forensic accountants are now trying to determine where tens of millions of dollars from Cobain's estate ended up and how it could be recovered, Holmes said.", "Q": ["Q: who committed suicide at 27, 15 years ago A:", "Q: Who did Kurt Cobain play for?

{"article": "Editor's note: Ronald F. Ferguson is Senior Lecturer in Education and Public Policy at the Harvard Graduate School of Education and the Harvard Kennedy School. His most recent book is \"Toward Excellence with Equity: An emerging vision for closing the achievement gap,\" published by Harvard Education Press. He is the creator of the Tripod Project for School Improvement and also the faculty co-chair and director of the Achievement Gap Initiative at Harvard University.  Ronald Ferguson says parents can play a key role in improving their children's education.  CAMBRIDGE, Massachusetts (CNN) -- Raising the quality of teaching and learning in American schools is a priority. It receives a great deal of attention in our national discourse and should receive more.  Test scores and graduation rates are improving faster in other nations than in the United States and this threatens our quality of life in a competitive world.  In addition, achievement gaps between racial groups in the United States remain large. The social and political vitality of the nation may depend on closing these racial gaps. Blacks and Hispanics are doing better than in the past compared to whites, but still not nearly good enough.  Making schools better should be only one part of our national strategy. Life at home has been a relatively neglected topic and needs to come out of the shadows.  Especially in churches, neighborhood organizations, families and informal social networks, helping parents do their best needs to be as big a priority as achieving excellent schools.  This goes beyond public policies. I am talking about changes in mindsets and lifestyles in a national social and cultural movement to close achievement gaps between groups -- a movement to achieve excellence with equity.  More reading at home is a place to start. I present data in my recent book based on a large sample of students in elementary and secondary schools from several states.  Black and Hispanic students reported less leisure reading at home compared to whites, watched television more, were much more likely to have televisions in their bedrooms and (perhaps as a consequence) were more prone to become sleepy at school. Also, blacks and Hispanics, including those with college-educated parents, reported fewer books in their homes than whites whose parents had fewer years of schooling.  However, life at home helps shape academic outcomes long before children begin reading books. Family-level supports in the first two years of life help predict achievement years later, in elementary school.  Beginning soon after birth, the most supportive mothers teach the joy of living and learning, through lots of active, encouraging, verbal and nonverbal communication. They engage actively in helping children learn to walk and talk and to explore their new world and manipulate their toys and other objects.  Such mothers exist in large numbers in every racial group. Nonetheless, in a recent study by Harvard's Richard Murnane and co-authors, differences in mother-child interaction patterns like these were found to account for one-third of the black-white gap in math and English skills at the beginning of kindergarten -- and one-quarter at the end of third grade.  As children get older, highly responsive parents spend time with children, look for ways to be helpful and encourage them to voice their opinions. They are good listeners and they teach their children that they have a right to be heard and that people in positions of authority can sometimes be persuaded. The same parents can also be demanding, providing rules and structure and holding children consistently accountable for their behavior.  Professor Jelani Mandara of Northwestern University found in a nationally representative sample that students who achieved the highest test scores among blacks, Hispanics and whites had parents who were both responsive and demanding.  According to the study, white parents were much more likely to be both responsive and demanding than black and Hispanic parents; whereas black parents, in particular, were often highly demanding, but tended not to be as responsive in the ways the study measured. Among early adolescents, differences along these dimensions helped account for the higher test scores of whites as compared with blacks and Hispanics.  Findings like the above should be part of the conversation among black and Hispanic community leaders as they respond to the fact that even the children of college-educated parents often achieve at lower-than-expected levels.  It is true that children of every racial group do better, on average, when their parents have more education. For example, black 12th graders whose parents completed college have higher average test scores than black 12th graders whose parents only completed high school.  However, it is also true, according to the National Assessment of Educational Progress, that test score gaps between 12th-grade blacks and whites with highly educated parents -- parents with 16 or more years of schooling -- are greater than test score gaps between 12th-grade blacks and whites whose parents have less education.  These are unpleasant facts, but we cannot improve what we fear and refuse to confront. Yes, we should respectfully acknowledge and rectify injustices that have impeded the efforts of many non-white parents and we should also work relentlessly to provide high quality schooling opportunities for children from every background.  But especially in our own homes and communities, there is another responsibility. It is to give parents of every racial and social-class background the examples, encouragement and supports they need to help their children experience the joy of learning and develop ambitious attitudes and habits of mind that will serve them well throughout their lives.  As one effort to accept this responsibility, the Achievement Gap Initiative at Harvard University has begun convening the AGI Parent Leadership Network. Beginning in September 2008, researchers and parent leaders from communities in several states have met every four months at Harvard to learn about relevant research, trade ideas, coach one another, and share examples of their own leadership.  Presentations and discussions have covered topics ranging from home-learning lifestyles to ways of helping schools and holding them accountable. The main purpose is to equip parent leaders with ideas and energy for helping others in home communities to help ALL our children succeed.  In the Civil Rights Movement, legions of people worked in a multitude of ways for racial justice. That work continues. However, the time has come for a movement focused on realizing our full human potential as learners. We need a movement for excellence with equity -- to prepare all our children for the social, ethical and intellectual challenges of a 21st century world.

{"article": "LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Michael Jackson's father wants a judge to order the pop star's estate to pay him a monthly allowance, according to papers filed in court Friday.  Joe Jackson, the 80-year-old Jackson family patriarch, was not named in Michael Jackson's 2002 will, which left his wealth to his mother, Katherine Jackson, his three children and undisclosed charities.  Brian Oxman, Joe Jackson's lawyer, filed the petition Friday asking for him to be included in the family allowance.  The matter will be considered Tuesday when Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Mitchell Beckloff convenes the next hearing on matters related to the probate of Jackson's will, Oxman said.  The filing does not publicly specify how much Jackson's father is requesting.  Howard Weitzman, one of the lawyers for the estate's special administrators, said Joe Jackson's request \"will be considered as are all requests for money from Michael's estate.\"  \"It was quite surprising to learn of the request,\" Weitzman said.  Michael Jackson's mother and his three children receive a court-ordered allowance from the estate totaling more than $86,000 a month, according to court documents. The money is in addition to the maintenance of the home -- which is owned by the estate -- in Encino, California, where Katherine Jackson lives with her grandchildren, the papers said.  Although Joe and Katherine Jackson are still married, Joe Jackson lives in Las Vegas, Nevada.  Joe Jackson is credited with launching and guiding his family's show business success, but Michael Jackson had publicly criticized his father's parenting skills.  Tuesday's hearing could also see a new challenge by the Jackson family of the 2002 will.  Michael Jackson died June 25, but the probate of his will has been slowed by a series of court squabbles between Katherine Jackson's lawyers and the two men now in control of the estate.  John Branca and John McClain, who are named as executors in the will, were appointed temporary special administrators to run the estate until the process is completed.  Katherine Jackson replaced the lawyers representing her in the estate case last month with attorney Adam Streisand. Another Jackson family lawyer said the change was made because the case was about to take a \"new direction\" based on \"new evidence\" uncovered by the family.  Attorney Londell McMillan pointed to questions about the authenticity of the signature on Michael Jackson's will.  Tuesday's estate hearing will be Streisand's first appearance in the case.  A trial has been tentatively set for December to decide any challenge of the will, although Streisand said last month he expected it to be set for early next year.  The A&E network announced Friday that \"The Jacksons: A Family Dynasty\" television series will launch with two hours of programming on Sunday night, December 13.  Four of Michael Jackson's brothers -- all except Randy Jackson -- are involved in the show \"as they prepare for a Jackson Five reunion, while also coming to terms with Michael's tragic loss,\" the network said.

{"article": " -- For the first time in a few years, talk about airline bankruptcies has ramped up once again, with concerns expressed this week about a certain carrier based in Texas.  Whether the reports about American Airlines are true or not doesn't really matter -- it's enough to make people anxious.  I've received a fair bit of e-mail this last week asking what happens if bankruptcy becomes a reality. In short, there's nothing to worry about with an airline like American, but I thought it would be a good idea to devote this week's column to the issue since it's at the top of mind for many travelers.  Will American go bankrupt? I'm certainly not qualified to answer that question. Only the airline itself knows its plans, but the balance sheet certainly doesn't point to bankruptcy being necessary in the short to medium term.  Yes, American has been losing money recently while others have profited, but at the end of June, it had more than $5 billion in the bank and it has been able to arrange financing since then. That doesn't sound like a company that would be filing for bankruptcy protection, which should be a last resort. Even if it does for some strategic reason, flights wouldn't be affected.  Still, it's worth talking about what to do when an airline goes bankrupt, because airlines around the world shut down every year. It's always good to know what you can do. Here is some advice.  Always pay with a credit card  When you buy a ticket, you might be paying for something (a flight, presumably) that you won't use for another year. That's a long time for an airline to hold on to your money, and that's why you should pay with a credit card.  If you buy a ticket with a credit card, then you won't be on the hook if your airline goes under. In fact, when airlines start to find themselves in financial trouble, credit card processors hold back a larger and larger percentage of the money until the flight occurs. That way, if the airline doesn't perform, the credit card company still has your money and can give it right back to you.  Periodically check in on your airline  It sounds silly when you're talking about an airline like American, because you would know instantly if it filed for bankruptcy protection. But what if you bought a ticket on Kuwait-based Wataniya Airways? Would you even know that it shut down in March of this year? Probably not.  So if you do find yourself booked on an airline that might not be very well known here in the U.S., it can't hurt to check in every so often to make sure it's still flying. Most airlines with websites are very good at letting you know when they go out of business.  Even better, you can set up an alert via Google that will send you a note anytime an airline's name pops up in the news. This is hardly necessary for the better-known airlines around the world, of course, but it's a good idea for smaller airlines that you want to keep an eye on.  Have a backup plan  If you're worried about an airline going out of business for one reason or another, have a mental backup plan waiting in case you need to spring into action. Find out what other airlines fly where you need to go, and be ready to try to pounce if something happens. If you're prepared, you'll be able to get that last seat on your alternate before someone else who was unprepared even knows what's happening. But you'll still have to pay for it.  Don't expect help from other airlines  There used to be a rule in the U.S. that other airlines had to honor tickets on failed airlines for a nominal fee. That doesn't exist anymore, so don't go looking for charity from other airlines if yours goes under. Elsewhere in the world, there can be varying levels of assistance, but it's best to just assume that you'll get none. At best, you'll be lucky to find an airline that will take you on standby, but that's not necessarily helpful for people with set plans.  Ultimately, the best advice is to just be alert. If your airline stops flying, act quickly to find the best alternate options, and you'll still get where you need to go. But if you're worried about a big airline failing here in the U.S., I wouldn't get too worked up about it.

The operation, dubbed \"Operation Crank Call,\" also resulted in more than 200 arrests and the recovery of 123 pounds of cocaine and 4.5 pounds of heroin, Tempe, Arizona, police said in a statement. They worked with detectives from the Phoenix Drug Enforcement Administration during the 15-month investigation, at least a part of which was conducted undercover.  \"The success of this operation is a direct result of Law Enforcement agencies working cooperatively toward a common goal. That goal is to rid our communities of organized crime,\" Tempe Chief of Police Tom Ryff said in the statement.  \"These are sophisticated, criminal enterprises. As Chief of Police, I am committed to working in partnership with the community and other law enforcement agencies to curtail drug trafficking in the City of Tempe and throughout the valley,\" he added.  Police said the dismantled trafficking ring was linked to the much-feared Sinaloa cartel, which has been blamed for widespread acts of violence across the border in Mexico.  In October, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials said that at least 70 suspected drug smugglers with alleged ties to the Sinaloa cartel had been arrested.

{"article": " -- A receptionist with a gunshot wound in her stomach played dead under her desk and called 911 on Friday after a shooting massacre in a Binghamton, New York, immigration center.  Zhanar Tokhtabayeba, who was taking an English class at the center, says she hid in a closet during the rampage.  It is unclear how much time passed from the moment the woman and her colleague were shot until she placed the 911 call, police said.  But by the time law enforcement arrived at the American Civic Association, about two minutes after the 10:31 a.m. call to 911, the shootings had ceased and 14 people were dead in the center, including the suspected gunman, law enforcement officials said.  Four more people were wounded in the attack, in what the city's mayor has called the \"most tragic day in Binghamton's history.\"  The incident has sent shockwaves through Binghamton, a city of about 50,000 about 140 miles northwest of New York City, as police work to confirm the gunman's identity.  A senior law enforcement source with detailed knowledge of the investigation identified the suspect as Jiverly Wong, who is believed to be in his early 40s.  Authorities executed a search warrant at Wong's home in Johnson City, near Binghamton, and spoke to the suspect's mother, the source said.  Binghamton police Chief Joseph Zikuski said Wong, a naturalized U.S. citizen, was unemployed at the time of the shooting. He told CNN's Susan Candiotti that Wong had recently worked in a vacuum repair shop.  Christine Guy said she worked with Wong a few years a go at Endicott Interconnect Technologies, a high-tech electronics company in Endicott, New York, where he was an engineer.  He went by the name \"Vaughn,\" which is what co-workers called him, she said.  View photos from the scene in Binghamton \u00bb  \"He was quiet -- not a violent person,\" said Guy, who now lives in Wellington, Colorado. \"I can't believe he would do something like this.  Police are still investigating motives but said the use of a car to block the back door of the building suggested premeditation.  \"It is our understanding he had ties to the civic association,\" Zikuski said.  Watch Zikuski give a timeline of the shooting \u00bb  The shooter, who was carrying a satchel of ammunition, was found dead of an apparently self-inflicted gunshot to the head, Zikuski said.  In all, law enforcement removed 14 bodies from the building and 37 survivors, Zikuski said.  Watch Binghamton's mayor extend his condolences \u00bb  Two semi-automatic handguns -- a.45-caliber and a 9-millimeter -- were found at the center, where immigrants were believed to be taking citizenship and language classes.  Most of those who managed to survive the incident hid in a boiler room and storage closets during the rampage.  \"I heard shootings, very long time, about five minutes, and I was thinking when it will be stopped, but it was continued. No screaming, yelling, just silence, shooting, silence, shooting, silence,\" said Zhanar Tokhtabayeba, who was taking an English class.  \"It's free English class and it's very good, but now I'm scared to go,\" she said.  Others in the building also reportedly described lulls between the gunshots.  \"They told me they tried to be quiet and run away,\" Than Huynh, 45, a high school teacher who translated for some of the Vietnamese survivors during police interviews, told the New York Times.  At 10:31 a.m., authorities received a 911 call from the receptionist, who said she'd been shot in the stomach, Zikuski said.  View a timeline of recent U.S. shootings \u00bb  She told police that a man with a handgun also shot and killed another receptionist before proceeding to a nearby classroom, where he gunned down more victims, Zikuski said.  While the gunman continued to fire, 26 others in the center hid in a boiler room downstairs, where law enforcement found them.  It took another two hours or so for officers to clear the building. Some men who were led out of the building in plastic handcuffs were not considered suspects, the chief said.  Wilson Medical Center spokeswoman Christina Boyd said the Binghamton hospital was treating two females and one male for gunshot wounds.  Another victim, a male Binghamton University student, was treated and is in stable condition at Our Lady of Lourdes Memorial Hospital in Binghamton, hospital spokeswoman Kathy Cramer said. Watch store owner describe police 'flooding the streets' \u00bb  One man who owns a business across the street said he didn't realize anything was wrong until police cars came rushing to the scene.  \"We were thinking that there's some sort of dispute, some disagreement,\" Richard Griffis told CNN. \"But then it became obvious it was more than a disgreement, there must be some sort of gun involved because of the way they were surrounding the building.\"  President Obama and first lady Michelle Obama offered their condolences to the grieving community.

{"article": "UNITED NATIONS (CNN) -- The United Nations is calling on NATO to do more to stop the Afghan opium trade after a new survey showed how the drug dominates Afghanistan's economy.  Afghan villagers tend to opium poppies in Taliban-controlled Helmand province in April 2007.  The report from the U.N.'s Office on Drugs and Crime shows the export value of this year's poppy harvest stood at around $4 billion, a 29 per cent increase over 2006.  Despite Afghan security forces' efforts to curb the trade, 660 tons of heroin and morphine were trafficked out of the country in 2007, the report said.  Opium is derived from poppies, and the data on cultivation was collected by examining satellite images and by assessments on the ground.  The report said opium has accounted for more than half of Afghanistan's gross domestic product in 2007. InvestorWords.com defines GDP as the total market value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given period of time, usually a calendar year.  According to the U.N. survey, about a quarter of the earnings from opium go to farmers. The rest goes to district officials who collect taxes on the crop, to drug traffickers and to the insurgents and warlords who control the trade.  Antonio Maria Costa, executive director of the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime, urged NATO to take a more active role in countering the spread of the drug trade, which has increased dramatically since the American-led invasion to remove the hard-line Islamist government of the Taliban in October 2001.  \"Since drugs are funding the insurgency, NATO has a self-interest in supporting Afghan forces in destroying drug labs, markets and convoys,\" Costa said in a written statement to coincide with the release of the survey. \"Destroy the drug trade and you cut off the Taliban's main funding source.\"  James Appathurai, a NATO spokesman, said coalition forces were equally concerned by the rapid growth in the narcotics trade.  \"We share the U.N.'s concerns,\" Appathurai told CNN. \"Drugs not only poison people, but they poison economies and governments, and it is in everyone's interest to stop this proliferation.\"  He said NATO forces were providing assistance to Afghan police through training and transport but he said there were no plans to deploy coalition troops to intervene directly.  \"The issue of whether we can do more is certainly a live discussion for NATO, but at the moment this is a matter for the Afghan government,\" Appathurai said.  Farming of opium poppies has been almost eradicated in the north and west of the country, Appathurai said.  However, he said, in the lawless southern provinces and especially in the Taliban stronghold of Helmand, poppy production was going on largely unchecked.  According to the report, U.N. observers have noticed a proliferation of heroin labs in neighboring countries and along trafficking routes.  Costa said the labs are dependent on precursor chemicals, like acetic anhydride, that must be smuggled into the region.  He called for tighter controls in chemical-producing countries and stronger intelligence-sharing between Afghanistan and its neighbors.  \"Drug trafficking is a transnational threat, and therefore national initiatives have their limitations,\" the U.N. drug chief said.  Appathurai said the most effective way to curb the drug trade was tackling the insurgency head-on. He also said it was important to provide alternative work for poor Afghan farmers to encourage them to give up opium production.  \"You cannot have eradication in isolation. If we don't give them the support to produce alternative crops, then by wiping out their opium fields, you are only creating enemies for the future,\" he said.

{"article": "Cairo (CNN) -- Egyptians reveled in their chance to vote in a post-Hosni Mubarak era during a second day of parliamentary elections, but nightfall brought new clashes in Cairo's Tahrir Square that stretched into Wednesday.  At least 88 people had been hurt, 28 of them seriously enough to go to a hospital, a Health Ministry official, Dr. Adel Adawi, told the state-run newspaper Al-Ahram. The rest were treated at makeshift clinics in the square, Adawi said, but hospitals expected more people to be brought in.  The victims had been hit by rocks, glass bottles, birdshot and Molotov cocktails, Dr. Hisham Sheeha, another Health Ministry official, told CNN. At least a dozen gunshots rang out across the plaza, and ambulances darted in and out of the square as the fighting continued.  Tahrir Square was the epicenter of the protests that drove Mubarak from power in February and the ongoing demonstrations against the military council that succeeded him. The state-run Middle East News Agency, citing a military source, said there were no police or troops in the square at the time.  Witnesses said Tuesday's melee began with fights between vendors and protesters, who began throwing rocks and attacking their kiosks with sticks. The protesters complained some vendors were giving demonstrations a bad image by selling marijuana, said Mina Hagras, one of the demonstrators who has been camped in the square.  \"This is not the spirit of the revolutionaries or the square,\" Hagras said. \"They warned them. They did not stop. So they took matters in their own hands and beat them up. Now, state TV is saying all the protesters in (the) square are thugs and drug users. This is not fair.\"  But Mohamed Shafei, whose sandwich stand was destroyed in the brawl, said the protesters turned on the vendors indiscriminately and confiscating their goods.  \"Yes, there were several vendors selling hashish and pills, but not all of us are the same,\" Shafei said as he carried the remains of his kiosk. \"Now the vendors are pissed and retaliating.\"  The new clashes came after a second day of voting, the first time some Egyptians -- young and old -- have ever cast ballots. Citizens are picking members of the lower house of parliament, which will be tasked with drafting a new constitution after three decades of Mubarak's rule.  Despite logistical problems and illegal campaigning that marred the first day of balloting on Monday, Egypt's stock exchange opened considerably higher Tuesday and saw an unprecedented wave of buying amid the elections.  Voters decried the late opening of polling stations Monday and a delay in the arrival of ballots, leading the head of Egypt's election committee to promise a smoother voting process Tuesday.  Election officials said they have received 964 complaints, 579 of which have been addressed, according to Egypt TV. State TV reported that 25 people were injured in election-related violence.  Activist Hafez Abu Saeeda, of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights, said on Twitter he was in Al-Khaleefa \"working on an election tour, and an attack took place on our supporters before I arrived.\" The army was able to control the situation immediately, he said. One person was injured.  But many voters expressed jubilation at their chance to help build a new Egypt after the popular revolt that toppled Mubarak.  \"Before, there was always cheating. Now -- I could be wrong -- but I think my vote will count,\" Mohamed Rida'a Mohamed Abdulla said as he left a Cairo polling station.  Some polling areas were segregated by gender. Lines at both men's and women's stations snaked around buildings for hours.  \"It's an awakening,\" one woman said, beaming, at a Cairo polling station. \"I'm very happy, and I feel that even when I see old ladies hardly walking, it makes me feel that really Egypt is reviving.\"  The stakes are high for Egyptian women, who worry that if Islamists gain a majority in the lower house of Parliament, their hopes for a more liberal life will be quashed.  In Alexandria, the Al Noor Salafi Muslim party and the Freedom and Justice Party accused one another of breaking an \"honorable agreement\" aimed at cooperation. The Freedom and Justice Party is part of the once-banned Muslim Brotherhood, one of the nation's largest organizations.  Yousri Hamad, a spokesman for the Al Noor Salafi party, said the Muslim Brotherhood spread false rumors and launched a \"smear campaign\" against the party.  \"We were not as prepared for the elections as we should have been and did not spend enough money on the campaigning,\" Hamad said.  But Essam Erian, spokesman for the Freedom and Justice Party, said the Salafis had breached the agreement by making such accusations without evidence.  Ali Al Dali, an official monitor for the Egyptian Association of Human Rights, said eight cases of vote-buying had been documented in Alexandria, and police had been notified. About 45% of eligible voters in the city had cast ballots, he said.  Elections for the lower house are scheduled to take place in three stages, based on geography. The last of the three stages is set to take place in January.  Upper house elections will run between January and March.  Presidential elections will be held by June, according to the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, Egypt's acting ruling body. Military leaders have said they will hand over power to a new government when one is elected, but many Egyptians say they don't trust the council and fear the military will cling to power.  Over the past two weeks, at least 42 people have been killed in clashes as protesters called for an immediate end to military rule. An additional 3,250 have been wounded, according to the Health Ministry.  Some Egyptians expressed skepticism or even boycotted the voting on Monday.  \"There is no inclination that the judiciary is independent, so there is no way to prove the election will be free and fair,\" said Amr Hamzawy, a 32-year-old shopkeeper.

The UK's Crown Prosecution Service requested that the case against Brian Thomas, who killed wife Christine while they were on vacation in 2008, be dropped due to a \"unique set of circumstances.\"  Thomas, 59, of Neath, South Wales, had been on trial for murder at Swansea Crown Court, with prosecutors seeking a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity that would have resulted in psychiatric custody.  But they said a closer study of evidence led them to believe the defendant should be released without further action.  \"We have duty to keep cases under continuous review, and following expert evidence from a psychiatrist it was suggested no useful purpose would be served by Mr Thomas being detained and treated in a psychiatric hospital,\" prosecutor Iwan Jenkins said in a statement.  Jenkins said that there had never been any doubt that Thomas caused his wife's death, but the prosecution accepted evidence from experts on sleep disorders that indicated he should not be convicted of murder or manslaughter.  \"We therefore have offered no further evidence and asked the jury to return a simple verdict of not guilty.\"  The court erupted in shouts of \"yes\" as family members greeted the outcome with jubilation, according to the UK Press Association.  \"The death of Christine Thomas was thoroughly investigated by Dyfed Powys Police. Investigations continued after Mr Thomas was charged and involved the instruction of experts in several fields,\" Jenkins said.  \"I must emphasize that the circumstances of this case are almost unique in the UK and there have been fewer than 50 instances recorded worldwide. It is only because of highly sophisticated tests carried out by sleep experts that Mr Thomas's condition could be confirmed.  \"Our thoughts remain with the family of Brian and Christine Thomas, who have remained dignified throughout this difficult time.\"  The brief trial, which opened Tuesday, heard that Thomas killed his wife while the pair were taking a camper van vacation in western Wales, PA reported.  One night, Thomas -- who experts said may have been suffering worsening dreams due to withdrawal from anti-depressants -- experienced a violent nightmare in which he attacked and fought an intruder and got him in a headlock, only to wake and find he had strangled his wife.  Dismissing the charges, High Court Judge Justice Davis described Thomas as a \"decent man and devoted husband\" who bore no responsibility for his wife's death, PA reported.  Thomas's brother Raymond Thomas said the family were \"delighted\" by the outcome, the news agency said.  \"He has always been a loving husband and a family man,\" he said. \" This was a tragic, tragic episode and we are all very emotional.\"", "Q": ["Q: what was the verdict A:", "Q: who says \"decent man and devoted husband\"?

{"article": " -- Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner signed a decree Tuesday requiring all ships navigating from Argentina to the disputed Falkland Islands to carry a government permit.  The move comes as tensions over the territory simmer because of British oil companies' efforts to drill off the northern coast of the islands.  The Falklands, known as Las Malvinas in Argentina, lie in the South Atlantic Ocean off the Argentinean coast and have been under British rule since 1833. But Argentina has always claimed sovereignty over them.  The two nations fought a war over the islands in 1982.  Tuesday's decree followed an accusation made last week by the Argentine government that a ship docked on the mainland was preparing to transport tubes to the Falklands for oil and gas exploration.  The decree also creates a special commission that will oversee the application of the new measure.  \"It's public knowledge that the United Kingdom has started the search for hydrocarbon resources in the Falkland Islands area,\" Argentine Cabinet Chief Anibal Fernandez said at a news conference, according to the official Telam news agency.  The Argentine position is that natural resources around the islands should be protected, and Britain must accept international resolutions labeling the Falklands a disputed area.  \"This has to do with the defense of the interests of Argentineans, not just about sovereignty,\" Fernandez said, adding that Argentina lays claim not just to the islands, but to any resources that could be found there.  The Argentines blame \"unilateral moves\" by the British companies toward exploration as the reason for the recent spat.  \"The companies that are planning to explore and exploit gas and oil are going to be met with legal challenges because they are doing it on a continental shelf that Argentina maintains is our own,\" Argentine congressman Ruperto Godoy told CNN.

{"article": " -- A controversial exhibition featuring preserved corpses having sex opened Thursday in Germany's capital.  Gunther von Hagens' controversial \"Body Works\" shows have traveled throughout the world.  Part of his traveling \"Body Works\" exhibition, \"The Cycle of Life,\" is showing at Berlin's Postbahnhof and features 200 human bodies at various life stages -- from conception to old age, including embryos and fetuses taken from historic anatomical collections.  In one exhibit a male body is lying on his back with a woman sitting astride him with her back towards his head.  Torsten Woehlert, spokesman for Berlin's Culture Ministry, told CNN that there has already been a number of complaints from the public in the press, though none have come to the ministry itself.  He said: \"As it is not against the law, only against good taste, there is not much the government could do anyway.\"  Conceived by Gunther von Hagens -- dubbed Dr. Death in Germany -- the exhibition displays the bodies with their muscles, nerves and tendons on show using a preservation technique he pioneered called plastination.  This process involves replacing all body fluids and soluble fat with specially manufactured plastics.  On his Web site, the anatomist describes the exhibition's purpose and goal \"to reveal and expose the anatomical structure of the human body and its function, in a unique lesson, and to teach us about the complexity of the human body, its anatomy, and the importance of leading a healthy way of life.\" What do you think?  He added that the source of the exhibition is from donors -- people, who during their lifetime, declared their willingness, by informed consent, to display their bodies at the exhibition for the \"benefit of education, health and the awareness of the wide public to the different systems of the human body.\"  When asked about the coupling of sex and death, von Hagens told Germany's Bild that \"death and sex are both taboo topics. I'm bringing them together. Death belongs to life.\" He added that \"without sex no life would exist.\"  Von Hagens' work has divided opinion in the past, with critics often doubting his scientific motives and accusing him of shocking people to gain publicity.  His public autopsy in 2002 for British broadcaster Channel 4 -- the first in the UK for 170 years -- received hundreds of complaints. The authorities also threatened to arrest him after declaring the procedure illegal.  Von Hagens justified his actions as \"demystifying the post mortem examination,\" and likened the medical profession to \"medieval priests who would not allow ordinary people to read the Bible,\" The New Scientist reported.", "Q": ["Q: What is the name of the exhibit?

{"article": "LAS VEGAS, Nevada (CNN) -- Former Beatles Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr clowned around and marveled at their band's amazing impact in an interview Tuesday on CNN's \"Larry King Live.\"  Larry King, left, poses with (l-r) Paul McCartney, Yoko Ono Lennon, Olivia Harrison and Ringo Starr Tuesday in Las Vegas.  \"We were just kids from Liverpool,\" McCartney said. \"And, yes, it is quite amazing, because as time goes on, it kind of becomes more and more of a phenomenon.\"  McCartney said the early Beatles knew they were a good band and were pretty sure of themselves, but Starr said, \"We thought we'd be really big in Liverpool.\"  \"I think the most exciting thing is that, you know, we expect people our age to know the music. But actually, a lot of kids know the music,\" Starr said. \"And if anything is left, we have left really good music, and that's the important part, not the moptops or whatever.\"  The pair appeared relaxed in sneakers and almost matching black suits and joked frequently -- often at each other's expense.  \"They were nothing,\" Starr said of his former bandmates. \"And then I joined and then they got this record deal and look what happened.\"  \"No, we were good,\" McCartney retorted. \"You wanted to join us. You begged to join us.\"  \"I didn't beg,\" Starr said.  Watch Paul and Ringo talk about the Beatles' magic \u00bb  McCartney and Starr were in Las Vegas with Yoko Ono Lennon and Olivia Harrison, the widows of John Lennon and George Harrison, to celebrate the anniversary of Cirque du Soleil's \"Love,\" which uses the Beatles' music.  Harrison said her husband was friends with Cirque du Soleil founder Guy Laliberte and came up with the idea before he died of cancer in 2001.  \"George was around just long enough to transmit that to all of us,\" Harrison said.  Ono said she wasn't sure at first what her husband would have thought about the project. John Lennon was shot near the couple's New York apartment in 1980.  \"Now I really know that John would be very happy with this,\" she said.  Neither woman has remarried and they both said it was still sometimes difficult to deal with their losses.  \"We feel so strongly about our husbands that sometimes it's hard for us, isn't it?\" Ono said.  \"It's hard, you know,\" Harrison said. \"I mean their presence is very powerful and very strong. But the incredible thing about them is that they -- everything they left the world and left us is uplifting and joyful.\"  The Beatles' music received a bit of a facelift for the show and has been remixed in 5.1 surround sound. (An album, \"Love,\" came out last year.)  \"Paul and I went to listen to the music in 5.1 and we go 'Whoa, listen to that,' \" Starr said. \"You know you can hear everything now. Things that we buried a lot. It's all very clear, so it's really great to hear it.\"  \"Most historic stuff goes down with age, you know?\" McCartney added. \"Winston Churchill's old papers go brown and crinkly, while our music gets brighter and shinier.\"  \"Next year, it will be 10.1,\" Starr joked.  McCartney's latest solo album, \"Memory's Almost Full,\" is No. 3  on the album charts and Starr is scheduled to release a greatest hits album in August.

{"article": "LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Perhaps Ryan Seacrest said it best at the top of the \"American Idol\" Tuesday night when describing Adam Lambert and Kris Allen, the show's final two contestants.  In this corner: Kris Allen, the guy next door.  \"It is the battle of the acoustic rocker versus the glam rocker. Conway (Arkansas) versus California. The guy next door versus the guy-liner.\"  After three performances apiece and plenty of judge feedback, it seems that the Southern California glam-rocker Adam Lambert has the edge -- but it didn't look that way early in Tuesday's show.  In the first round, where the contestants chose a song from a favorite past performance this season, Simon Cowell declared Kris Allen the winner after his rendition of \"Ain't No Sunshine\" on piano.  Watch Allen and Lambert talk after the show \u00bb  Lambert chose to sing \"Mad World\" while wearing a long black coat and walking around a stage filled with white smoke, all of which Cowell found \"over-theatrical.\"  \"I think 'Mad World' is kind of symbolic,\" Lambert told reporters after the show. \"It talks about people who don't feel like they fit in.\"  Round two featured a tune hand-picked by \"American Idol\" creator Simon Fuller, where Lambert ditched the black overcoat and belted out Sam Cooke's \"A Change Is Gonna Come\" while sporting a shiny silver suit. Paula Abdul told Lambert \"it was the best I've ever heard you sing, ever!\"  Allen's feedback after singing Marvin Gaye's classic \"What's Goin' On\" in the second round was much less flattering.  See the best and worst performances from season eight \u00bb  \"I thought it was too laid back for a night like this,\" said Cowell. He then gave round two to Lambert.  Round three featured a bit of a twist -- both contestants had to sing a song co-written by judge Kara DioGuardi called \"No Boundaries.\"  Lambert went first and had little difficulty with the ballad. Cowell told the 27-year-old afterward that \"you have been one of the best, most original contestants we've ever had on the show.\"  Allen, however, struggled to stay in tune during the entire performance... but the judges were less harsh this time.  \"You have thoroughly, thoroughly deserved to be standing on that stage tonight, congratulations,\" said Cowell.  Watch anchors debate \"Idol\" finalists \u00bb  After the show, Lambert told reporters that they did not have a lot of time to work on \"No Boundaries\" and it was kind of a \"rush job.\"  \"There was a lot of lyric, and it was a big song,\" said Lambert. \"But it's a beautiful song.\"  It almost seems appropriate that these two are facing off in the finale. According to Allen, he and Lambert were once roommates during the competition. They even critique each other's rehearsals.  \"He's always giving me stuff to change about mine... to make it better,\" Allen told reporters. iReport.com: Who should win: Kris or Adam?  A little over an hour before the show began, a magnitude 4.0 quake aftershock hit 10 miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles. Tuesday night's telecast was held at the Nokia Theater, which is in downtown Los Angeles. A 4.7-magnitude earthquake struck the area shortly before 8:40 p.m. Sunday.  But, to Allen's disappointment, neither of the contestants felt the jolt Tuesday.  \"I was totally upset, too, because I've never been to California (except for 'American Idol'), and I was like, 'I want to feel an earthquake.' \"  Allen and Lambert will return to the stage Wednesday night and find out, along with the rest of the world, who will be crowned the next \"American Idol\" at the two-hour finale.", "Q": ["Q: how many finals are in American Idol?

{"article": " -- Robert Barnett, a prominent Washington attorney, has worked on eight national presidential campaigns, focusing on debate preparation. He played the role of George H.W. Bush in practice debates with Geraldine Ferraro in 1984 and with Michael Dukakis in 1988, and practice debated Bill Clinton more than 20 times during the 1992 campaign. He also played the role of Dick Cheney in 2000 and 2004 and helped prepare Hillary Clinton for 23 primary debates for the 2008 nomination. Barnett spoke with CNNI's Michael Holmes.  Robert Barnett has been in practice debates with Democrats from Geraldine Ferraro to Bill Clinton.  CNN: How does Tuesday night's town hall format differ from other debates?  Barnett: The individuals will not necessarily express the question as a journalist would. So, for example, one of these people will probably not ask about Internal Revenue Service Code section 341, but rather will ask about their taxes and their tax burdens and what they care about with respect to taxation.  And so you have to be very careful to be sure you understand what the individual is asking about and you have to be particularly careful to answer the question, because if you don't, you risk alienating the questioner and the audience and the listeners.  CNN: You're in a unique position. You have prepped, I think, seven or eight presidential campaigns. You've done debate prep, you've stood in and played the role of Dick Cheney and others. What's that like? What are you trying to do to prepare the candidate, any candidate?  Barnett:  If I'm playing the surrogate, if you will, if I'm the Republican for a Democrat, I try to prepare myself -- not to imitate; I'm not Darrell Hammond or Dana Carvey. I'm not that talented. But I try to be ready with what my candidate that I'm playing, if you will, has said -- the exact words used, the way they counterattack, the way they attack.  And I try to make sure that the candidate I'm working with, meaning the Democrat, has heard just about everything that they could hear from their opponent before they ever walk on the stage.  CNN: Do you try to bait them, get them to bite a little and then say that's not what you should be doing?  Barnett: Well, it can get pretty contested. When I prepared with Rep. Geraldine Ferraro in 1984 when she was running against then-vice president George Herbert Walker Bush, I baited her a lot and she got so angry with me that she frequently walked over to me and slugged me on the arm. So I left the process black and blue.  CNN: When you're doing that sort of thing, how direct can you be with the candidate? Or do you have to treat them with a bit of kid gloves?  Barnett: I treat them with no kid gloves. It's fair to say I'm direct, I make sure they hear everything from me before they hear it on the stage and maybe hear it even a little more aggressively so they can be prepared.", "Q": ["Q: How long has Barnett played Republicans in practice debates?

{"article": "PADUCAH, Kentucky (CNN) -- Defense lawyers trying to save their client from the death penalty argued Tuesday that former U.S. soldier Steven Green exhibited clear symptoms of acute stress disorder in Iraq and that a military psychiatric nurse-practitioner failed to diagnose the troubled infantryman and pull him out of combat.  Former U.S. soldier Steven Green has been convicted of raping and killing a 14-year-old Iraqi girl.  Green was convicted last week in U.S. District Court in Kentucky of murder, rape, conspiracy and obstruction of justice.  A jury found Green guilty of a raping a 14-year-old girl, then killing her and setting her body on fire to destroy evidence. Green also was found guilty of killing the girl's parents and 6-year-old sister.  Green might become the first former U.S. soldier to face the death penalty for war crimes before a civilian court, where he was tried because he had been discharged from the military before his crimes came to light.  Four other former soldiers are in prison for their roles in the crimes and the cover-up that followed.  His lawyers offered testimony Tuesday from a psychiatrist who testified that a mental health review \"did not meet acceptable mental health standards.\"  Dr. Pablo Stewart testified that a military nurse-practitioner who examined Green some three months before the crimes \"had the answers in front of her that clearly marks all the symptoms of acute stress disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder.\"  Yet rather than pull Green out of combat or follow up with additional care, Stewart testified, the nurse-practitioner prescribed sleeping pills and sent Green back to his traffic checkpoint in an area known as the \"Triangle of Death,\" one of the bloodiest areas of the Sunni-led insurgency.  Earlier, defense lawyers had identified the nurse practitioner as Lt. Col. Karen Marrs, and she was called by the defense to testify. She described Green's company as having the worst morale she'd ever seen, and she said the entire battalion was \"red,\" meaning it was \"mission incapable\" -- the troops were \"hostile, vengeful and needed increased control and command,\" without which there was a greater likelihood of misconduct.  The psychiatric nurse said it was important for soldiers to return to duty, not only to keep up troop numbers, but also because \"soldiers evacuated prematurely have a hard time fitting in.\"  Marrs said procedures were followed, but it was difficult to keep precise records partly because soldier interviews took place under difficult conditions, in one case in a concrete structure that had a hole in the ceiling from a mortar shell.  She said troops often were counseled that \"having sad and angry feelings are common,\" and that \"you aren't a monster for having these thoughts in monstrous conditions.\"  At the time of Green's arrest, he told FBI agents, \"You probably think I'm a monster.\"  Throughout the testimony Tuesday, Green repeatedly glanced at the jury. He appeared pale, wearing a light-blue button-down shirt and pressed khakis. He smiled at times while talking to his lawyers.  He seemed moved by the testimony of his uncle, Greg Simolke, who broke down several times while speaking about his nephew.  \"(Steve) was one of these kids, everyone knows them, no matter what they do, nothing works out, like he had a black cloud hanging over him,\" Simolke said. Green lived with his uncle, an obstetrician, in North Carolina for a few months during his senior year in high school, according to testimony.  He moved back to Midland, Texas, where he was originally from, after a school counselor told him he was so far behind that he would have to take sophomore-level courses.  \"I don't know if any of us realized how far behind he was,\" said Simolke, who went on to describe how proud he was when his nephew finished his military training.  \"To me, that was a huge accomplishment for Steve,\" Simolke said before breaking down in tears.

{"article": " -- Two Swedish journalists who were found guilty in Ethiopia of supporting terrorism were sentenced to 11 years in jail Tuesday, the Swedish Foreign Ministry said.  \"Our belief was that the court would think they were journalists and they would be released. This is what the prime minister has said before,\" ministry spokesman Anders J\u00c3\u00b6rle said. \"It is not fair that they are sentenced since they are journalists on a journalistic mission.\"  \"They are innocent and have been convicted because of their journalistic work,\" said Tomas Olsson, the journalists' Swedish attorney. \"We are very disappointed.\"  A court convicted Johan Persson and Martin Schibbye last week.  Ethiopian troops captured Persson and Schibbye in July during an exchange of gunfire with a rebel group in the Ogaden, a prohibited region along the nation's border with Somalia, according to state media.  Ethiopian officials accused the journalists of being accomplices to terrorism after the government declared the Ogaden National Liberation Front a terrorist group in June.  Olsson said the 11-year sentence was the lowest possible one for the crimes they were convicted of.  \"The prosecutor sought 18 years imprisonment, so if you look at it that way, it is a positive thing that they got the lowest possible sentence,\" Olsson said. \"But since they are innocent, they are very disappointed.\"  Schibbye and Persson have until January 10 to decide if they want to appeal -- a process that could take up to two years -- or if they want to seek a pardon.  However, Olsson said, if they want to apply for a pardon the two have to admit the crimes, \"and since they are not guilty then this is not something they'd want to do.\"  Fredric Alm at the Sweden-based photojournalism agency Kontinent, for which the two men work, said they \"have a very hard decision ahead of them\" in considering whether to appeal or ask for a pardon, but that an 11-year sentence in an Ethiopian prison \"could effectively be a death sentence for them.\"  Alm added: \"The purpose of this verdict is to scare away all journalists from reporting in the Ogaden. But as journalists we have to continue reporting from closed areas. It's a very sad day for press freedom. It's a very sad day but it didn't come as a surprise for us. It's still a political verdict; it's not a real trial. It is the (Ethiopian) prime minister who has decided.\"  Persson and Schibbye were convicted on two counts: entering the country illegally and providing assistance to a terrorist organization, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ).  Press freedom groups say the two were embedded with the rebels while working on a story about the region.  Journalists and aid workers are prohibited from entering the Ogaden, where human rights organizations say human rights abuses against ethnic Somalis by rebels and Ethiopian troops are rampant.  \"The Ethiopian army's answer to the rebels has been to viciously attack civilians in the Ogaden,\" said Georgette Ganon of Human Rights Watch. \"These widespread and systematic atrocities amount to crimes against humanity.\"  Reporters Without Borders criticized the court's decision.  \"What are the Ethiopian authorities hoping to achieve?\" the international secretariat of the group asked. \"To discourage anyone from visiting the Ogaden, as these two journalists did? To send a warning signal to the national and international media about the danger of receiving a long jail sentence on a terrorism charge if they attempt any potentially embarrassing investigative reporting?\"  \"Our starting point is and remains that they have been in the country on a journalistic mission,\" Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt said in a statement last week. \"They should be freed as soon as possible and be able to rejoin their families in Sweden.\"  But presiding judge Shemsu Sirgaga said the two \"have not been able to prove that they did not support terrorism.\"  \"They have shown that they are esteemed journalists, but we cannot conclude that someone with a good reputation does not engage in criminal acts,\" Sirgaga said.  Both journalists pleaded guilty to entering the country illegally through Somalia without accreditation, according to the CPJ, which says Ethiopian officials deny media access without government minders.  \"We have documented violations of due process and the politicization of their trial,\" the CPJ said, complaining that the government pronounced the two guilty even before the trial started.  Amnesty International called for their release ahead of Tuesday's sentencing.  \"There is nothing to suggest that the two men entered Ethiopia with any intention other than conducting their legitimate work as journalists. The government chooses to interpret meeting with a terrorist organization as support of that group and therefore a terrorist act,\" said Claire Beston with the human rights group.  In a statement issued in September, Kontinent said that its journalists do not take sides or participate in any conflict and report under international rights regarding freedom of the press, which it believes should be upheld by any government.  The trial against the journalists turned into a fight for press freedom in Ethiopia, according to international journalists' organizations. In a letter sent to the United Nations, Reporters without Borders accused Ethiopia of using its anti-terrorism law to lessen press freedom and penalize free speech.  \"In the name of the fight against terrorism, the government muzzles dissident and critical voices, thus abusing human rights and fundamental freedoms,\" wrote the secretary general of Reporters without Borders, Jean-Francois Julliard.

{"article": " -- The European Union will launch its first naval operation Tuesday, protecting vessels from pirate attacks off the coast of Somalia, EU policy chief Javier Solana announced Monday.  A French army helicopter taking off from French frigate Nivose,  on patrol in the Gulf of Aden.  EU foreign ministers approved the mission during their regular meeting in Brussels on Monday. Solana said the operation is \"very important\" because EU vessels will be operating \"in a place in the world that everybody's looking at because of the new problems related to piracy.\"  \"It's very important that we have taken that decision to launch it tomorrow,\" he added.  The EU naval force will take over the role of escorting United Nations World Food Program vessels carrying food and relief supplies to war-torn Somalia, an EU news release said.  Its mandate, which is spelled out in several U.N. Security Council resolutions, also will include \"the protection of vulnerable vessels cruising off the Somali coast, and the deterrence, prevention and repression of acts of piracy and armed robbery off the Somali coast,\" the news release stated.  The deployment follows a decision by the European Council in September that established a coordination cell that supported surveillance and protection operations by several member states off the Somali coast.  Piracy has become increasingly common in that area this year, particularly in the Gulf of Aden. So far, pirates have attacked almost 100 vessels off Somalia's coast and successfully hijacked nearly 40, according to the International Maritime Bureau.  Those hijacked vessels include an enormous oil tanker, a chemical tanker, and a ship laden with Soviet-era arms, including tanks. The pirates normally hold the ships for ransom.  The Somali-based pirates have extended their reach beyond Somalia's coastline. On Saturday, a Dutch-operated container ship outran pirates off the coast of Tanzania, an IMB official told CNN.  A luxury cruise ship carrying more than 1,000 passengers and crew successfully outran pirates off the coast of Yemen last weekend.  A multinational fleet -- including vessels from the United States, NATO member states, Russia and India -- has been patrolling the Indian Ocean waters near the Gulf of Aden, which connects the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea. Around 20,000 oil tankers, freighters and merchant vessels pass along the crucial shipping route each year.  In a recent interview provided to CNN, a pirate leader claimed attacks on shipping would continue so long as life in Somalia remained desperate.  \"The pirates are living between life and death,\" said the pirate leader, identified by only one name, Boyah. \"Who can stop them? Americans and British all put together cannot do anything.\"", "Q": ["Q: What role will EU forces take now? A:", "Q: Who will take over the role of escorting U.N. World Food Program vessels?

{"article": "NEW YORK (CNN)  -- A potential victim became a compassionate counselor during a recent robbery attempt, changing the would-be criminal's mind -- and apparently his religion.  Surveillance video shows storekeeper Mohammad Sohail holding a robber at bay with a shotgun.  Storekeeper Mohammad Sohail was closing up his Long Island convenience store just after midnight on May 21 when -- as shown on the store's surveillance video -- a man came in wielding a baseball bat and demanding money.  \"He said, 'Hurry up and give me the money, give me the money!' and I said, 'Hold on',\" Sohail recalled in a phone interview with CNN on Tuesday, after the store video and his story was carried on local TV.  Sohail said he reached under the counter, grabbed his gun and told the robber to drop the bat and get down on his knees.  \"He's crying like a baby,\" Sohail said. \"He says, 'Don't call police, don't shoot me, I have no money, I have no food in my house.' \"  Amidst the man's apologies and pleas, Sohail said he felt a surge of compassion.  He made the man promise never to rob anyone again and when he agreed, Sohail gave him $40 and a loaf of bread.  \"When he gets $40, he's very impressed, he says, 'I want to be a Muslim just like you,' \" Sohail said, adding he had the would-be criminal recite an Islamic oath.  \"I said 'Congratulations. You are now a Muslim and your name is Nawaz Sharif Zardari.'\"  When asked why he chose the hybrid of two Pakistani presidents' names, the Pakistani immigrant laughed and said he had been watching a South Asian news channel moments before the confrontation.

{"article": "Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- Islamic militants have moved fighters to the Somali border town of Afmado in an effort to combat Kenyan forces who have entered Somalia, the militant group Al-Shabaab said Tuesday.  The group said it viewed the Kenyan forces crossing of the joint border as \"an affront to Somalia's territorial sovereignty.\"  This move of fighters, which started Monday, comes after the militant group had threatened to \"come into Kenya\" if Kenyan forces did not leave Somalia.  \"Kenyan troops have entered 100 kilometers into Somalia, and their planes are bombarding and killing residents,\" Sheikh Ali Mahmud Ragi, spokesman for Al-Shabaab, said in an online message posted on a jihadist website this week. \"We shall come into Kenya if you do not go back.\"  In response, the Kenyan and Somali governments issued a joint communique declaring Al-Shabaab \"a common enemy to both countries.\" They pledged to work together to stabilize Somalia and cooperate in security and military operations.  Kenyan forces crossed into Somalia to pursue Al-Shabaab fighters after the recent abductions of tourists and aid workers in Kenya heightened tensions in East Africa. Kenya invoked the U.N. charter allowing military action in self-defense against its largely lawless neighbor.  The abductions are part of a \"recent spate of blatant attacks\" that are part of \"a changed strategy by Al-Shabaab calculated to terrorize civilians,\" the communique said.  \"If you are attacked by an enemy, you have to pursue that enemy through hot pursuit and to try (to) hit wherever that enemy is,\" said Kenyan Defense Minister Yusuf Haji in a news conference that aired Sunday on CNN affiliate NTV.  Al-Shabaab, which is linked to al Qaeda, has been fighting to impose its interpretation of Islamic law, or sharia, on Somalia. The group issued a statement Tuesday, however, denying responsibility for the abductions.  \"These are mere suppositions unfounded in any solid evidence,\" the statement said. \"Kenyan authorities have been seeking justification for an aggressive incursion on to Somali territory.\"  On September 11, armed bandits broke into a beachfront cottage where Britons Judith and David Tebbutt, both in their 50s, were staying. David Tebbutt was shot dead while trying to resist the attack. His wife was grabbed and spirited away on a speedboat, and is believed to have been taken into Somalia.  On October 1, pirates made another cross-border raid, this time snatching a French woman in her 60s from a holiday home on Manda Island where she lived part of the year.  Earlier this month, gunmen abducted two Spanish workers from the medical charity Doctors Without Borders from the Dadaab refugee complex, about 80 kilometers (about 50 miles) from the Somali border.  Kenya announced its new tactics days after African Union forces claimed victory against Al-Shabaab in the Somali capital of Mogadishu. The military said last week it had taken the remaining Al-Shabaab strongholds in the far northeast of the city.  \"The challenge is now to protect civilians from the sort of terror attack we saw last week, as they attempt to rebuild their lives,\" said Lt. Col. Paddy Ankunda, spokesman for the African Union Mission in Somalia. He was referring to a suicide truck bombing in Mogadishu this month that left dozens dead. Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility. Other Al-Shabaab attacks that week led to the deaths of at least 10 civilians.  Federal and African Union forces have battled Al-Shabaab in the impoverished and chaotic nation for years. Many analysts believe the military push has severely affected Al-Shabaab, along with targeted strikes against organization members and the weakening of al Qaeda.  Al-Shabaab said in August it was withdrawing from Mogadishu, and Somalia's Transitional Federal Government, backed by African Union peacekeepers, now controls most districts of the capital, the U.N. office has said.

{"article": "(Tribune Media Services) -- Two young Iranian parents smiled at me, showing mock desperation as their little boy and girl eagerly dragged them into a shop famous for its pistachio ice cream sandwiches. Around the corner, filling the side of a 15-story building, a government-sponsored propaganda mural showed a perverted American flag, with skulls for stars and falling bombs for stripes.  Iranian women must wear a scarf, but many leave a tuft of hair showing at the forehead.  That bizarre mixture -- of saber-rattling politics alongside the personal warmth of individual locals -- is what struck me on my recent 12-day trip to Iran to film a public-television show. I found Iran to be perhaps the most misunderstood and fascinating land I've ever visited. And I learned a lot.  The country is not free. It seems that people -- motivated by fear of Western influences and love of their children -- have forgone democracy for their theocracy. Parents told me, \"We do not want our girls to grow up to be Britney Spears,\" and they are willing to sacrifice some freedom to achieve that goal. They feel their \"revolution of values\" provides an environment where they can raise their children free from the cheap sex, drug abuse and crass materialism of the West.  Iranian women must wear a scarf, but many leave a tuft of hair showing at the forehead. After several days, that provocative tuft attracted my eye like cleavage. Making sure that what they can show is as beautiful as possible, Iranian women, per capita, lead the world in nose jobs. Faces are beautifully made up, and -- when so much else is covered -- can be particularly expressive and mysterious. Eye contact is riveting.  Before arriving in Iran, I was so afraid of anti-Americanism that we had nearly left our big expensive TV camera in Athens and considered flying in with a less obtrusive model. But once there, I found people curious, courteous and quick to smile -- especially when they learned we were American. I've never had such fun with people or found them so chatty than on the streets of Iran.  Tehran is modern and bustling, with thriving shopping malls, cars clogging the streets and most people wearing Western-style clothes. Unlike many Muslim capitals, minarets do not dot the skyline, and I barely heard a call to prayer.  And yet it's clearly a theocracy. Multiple TV stations broadcast religious programming (along with BBC and CNN) that's perfect for praying -- images of the sun setting on the sea, or the pilgrimage center in Mecca in real-time. In the United States, billboards and ads encourage us to consume, but in Iran, government-sponsored billboards, Muzak and TV programming is all about the teachings of great holy men.  I asked my guide if it's okay to be non-Muslim in Iran. \"Yes,\" he said, \"We have religious freedom, as long as it is not offensive to Islam.\" Christian? \"Sure.\" Jewish? \"Sure.\" Bahai? \"No. We believe that Mohammed -- who came in the 7th century -- was the last prophet, so the Bahai prophet (19th century) is offensive to Islam.\"  I asked, \"What if you want to get somewhere in the military or government?\"  My guide answered, \"Then you better be a Muslim -- a practicing, Shiite Muslim.\"  Every film crew stops at the former U.S. Embassy. It was here in 1979 that a gang of revolutionary students stormed what they called the \"Den of Spies\" and held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days. For Iranians back then, it was a proud moment of triumph against the nation that had meddled in their affairs for years. The embassy wall is still covered with anti-American murals painted at that time. But the hostage crisis was 30 years ago. Most Iranians weren't even born then. It's ancient history to our young guide.  With our work done, we hurried to catch our flight home. As we crawled through Tehran's traffic, our driver cursed, \"Death to traffic.\"  Shocked, I said, \"What? I thought it was death to America.\"  He said, \"Here in Iran, when something frustrates us and is out of our control, we say 'death' to that.\"  Then I thought, when people in my society say, \"Damn those teenagers,\" they don't mean they wish them to die and burn in hell for eternity... they just want the kids to turn down the music.  Boarding our plane, the Air France flight attendants -- so stylish with hair flowing freely -- seemed to welcome us as if onto a life raft. Women pulled off their scarves, wine was poured, and we flew west with the raw footage of a program we hoped would humanize a proud country of 70 million people.

{"article": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- British military officials on Sunday said Prince William had not breached any rules when he used a Royal Air Force helicopter to drop in at his girlfriend's house.  Chinhook helicopters are normally used for transporting troops and equipment in war zones.  The prince, second in line to the throne, landed a Chinook helicopter -- normally used for transporting troops -- in a field next to the home of Kate Middleton, according to the News of the World tabloid.  The paper said the trip had caused fury among some in the military who saw it as a waste of time and money at a time when British forces are thinly-stretched, fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan.

{"article": " -- An infant falls to his death from a second-story window while his parents are making love.  Charlotte Gainsbourg and Willem Dafoe star in the Lars von Trier drama \"Antichrist.\"  The mother (Charlotte Gainsbourg) is consumed with grief and guilt. She's hospitalized and sedated for days and weeks before her husband (Willem Dafoe), a therapist, insists she return home. He gets rid of all her medications. He will be her partner and her grief counselor, and he will see her through this, if only she will place her trust in him.  Not a good idea for either of them, as it turns out.  Halloween is nearly upon us, but \"Antichrist\" is a mighty strange kind of horror movie, a wrenching psychodrama for two-thirds of its running time before collapsing into a steaming heap of deranged sadism and supernatural symbolism in the outrageous third act.  The movie's peculiarity can be accounted for in three words: Lars von Trier. The Danish provocateur twice won prestigious honors at the Cannes Film Festival (with \"Breaking the Waves\" and \"Dancer in the Dark\") and re-energized European art cinema in the 1990s with the Dogme movement's so-called \"Vows of Chastity.\"  It's not often that an art-house director takes up the implements to make a horror film, and for a while, \"Antichrist\" compels with its anguished intensity and audacious stylistic choices, not least the severity that keeps the focus exclusively on this man and woman, neither of whom is named.  The prologue -- the child's death -- is a luxurious, slow-motion rhapsody of explicit sex, black-and-white photography and baroque music, commingling with the infant's almost ersatz tragedy and finding perfunctory counterpoint in banal close-ups of the family's washer-dryer. (There may be a deliberate echo here of the famous sex scene in Nicolas Roeg's \"Don't Look Now,\" a far more keenly calibrated examination of grief succumbing to the supernatural.)  Dafoe and Gainsbourg are riveting as the ill-matched couple. He's an implacable rationalist, urging her to confront her fears and venture into the darkest recesses of her psyche. She's not sure he's ready to share that torment with her. Their bitter, sometimes sourly funny back-and-forth fleetingly echoes the railing, pugnacious and remorseful men and women we find again and again in Strindberg and Bergman.  Of course, when those great Scandinavian dramatists wanted to shock us with the ferocity of the battle of the sexes and show a married couple going at it tooth and nail, their only weapons were words. Mindful that he's up against \"Hostel,\" \"Saw\" and the like, Herr von Trier ups the ante considerably.  Hiking to a log cabin in the mountains to uncover the apex of his wife's fears (it could be anywhere, but let's imagine we're in the neighborhood of Burkittsville), the doctor's little experiment in exposure therapy ends in crushed genitals and, uh, worse. Much worse.  It's safe to say von Trier knows this climax is over the top: \"Chaos reigns!\" announces a fox, in perfect English, just as the movie goes off the deep end. Chaos reigns all right, and Gainsbourg's traumatized mom is transformed nonsensically into a raving psycho witch-bitch.  This director has often been accused of misogyny for the punishments that befall his heroines -- spuriously, in my opinion. But this time the boot is on the other foot, and for once the charge seems to stick; no matter that the first half of the movie suggests Dafoe's smug therapist is due for a comeuppance.  Apparently someone had a seizure when the movie showed at the New York Film Festival recently. When I caught up with it at the Vancouver International Film Festival two weeks ago, the screening was punctuated with the single loudest shriek I've ever heard in the theatre -- that would have been when Gainsbourg gets out the scissors for a spot of ad hoc auto-surgery. There also was a very vociferous walk-out: a gentleman who fairly barked \"You get what you pay for, folks\" as he made for the exit a full 20 minutes before the end.  That unhappy camper had a point. Either von Trier is barking up the wrong tree, or he's pandering to the basest instincts of an audience that's seen it all before and still demands more, more, more.

{"article": "(Entertainment Weekly)  -- For the past three weeks in a row, Michael Jackson's \"Number Ones\" has been the biggest-selling album in the country.  For the first time in a month, the No. 1 album on the Billboard 200 is actually the No. 1 selling album.  Each time, it's been disqualified from Billboard's flagship Billboard 200 chart, along with all Jackson's other releases, due to its age.  That unusual run of asterisked Billboard 200 chart-toppers is now over. Which artist put an end to Jackson's posthumous flummoxing of the Billboard rules, you ask? The answer is Chris Daughtry, whose \"Leave This Town\" bows atop the chart with a very nice 269,000 copies sold, according to Nielsen SoundScan.  That's actually a bit of a drop-off from the 304,000 that the first album from American Idol alum Chris Daughtry's band sold when it hit shelves in 2006, but it's more than anyone else could muster in this sales frame -- yes, even Michael.  And so for the first time in a month, the No. 1 album on the Billboard 200 is actually the No. 1 selling album in the U.S., no tricks, no fooling.  (\"Number Ones,\" meanwhile, sold another 192,000 this week, landing it handily atop the Top Comprehensive Albums chart, which counts catalog albums alongside new ones. So don't think that MJ's sales have dried up just yet.)  Other Billboard 200 debuts this week came from the Dead Weather's \"Horehound\" at No. 6, demonstrating that at least 51,000 devotees can be counted on to buy any side project Jack White dreams up.  R&B singer Joe, shows up at No. 7 after signing over 49,000 units of his \"Signature\"; Twista fast-talked his way into 45,000 sales and a No. 8 bow; and Christian power-pop teens pureNRG squeak in at No. 20 with 22,000 copies sold.

{"article": "LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- A judge declared a mistrial in the murder case against music legend Phil Spector after a jury announced for the second time in eight days that it was hopelessly deadlocked.  Phil Spector did not testify at his five-month murder trial. The jury said it was split 10-2.  The jury deliberated for 12 days, taking six ballots, but was unable to reach a unanimous verdict.  Jurors told Superior Court Judge Larry Paul Fidler they were split 10-2, without indicating which way they were leaning. They added there was nothing Fidler could do to help them arrive at a unanimous verdict.  Fidler discharged the nine men and three women, thanking them for their service.  Watch what the jurors have to say \u00bb  Spector went on trial in April, charged with second-degree murder in the shooting death of B-movie queen Lana Clarkson after a night out in the clubs of Hollywood.  The judge told attorneys to return to his Los Angeles, California, courtroom on October 3 to discuss the next legal move.  Spector, 67, did not take the witness stand at the trial.  Deliberations were arduous, entering the third week on Monday. Last week, jurors received new instructions on the law and were told to start over after the foreman declared the panel was deadlocked 7-5.  The jury's inability to reach a verdict capped a five-month trial that played like a Hollywood film noir classic -- with a twist of the bizarre.  A 6-foot-tall, blue-eyed blonde with a toothpaste commercial smile, Clarkson was known for her roles in \"Barbarian Queen\" and \"Amazon Women on the Moon.\" But at 40 the parts were few and far between and she had taken a $9-an-hour job as a VIP hostess at the House of Blues in Hollywood.  Spector invented the \"wall of sound\" in the 1960s and worked with the Beatles, Ike and Tina Turner and other acts. Normally reclusive, Spector had spent a rare night out on the town, found Clarkson at the House of Blues at closing time and invited her home for a drink in the wee hours of February 3, 2003.  After initially turning him down, she agreed to accompany him, according to testimony.  Hours later, police were summoned to Spector's mansion in Alhambra, a suburb of Los Angeles. The diminutive music producer had wandered into the driveway in the predawn and told his Brazilian-born chauffeur, \"I think I killed somebody,\" according to the driver's testimony.  Clarkson was found inside, slumped in a chair in the foyer. She had been shot in the mouth. A.38-caliber Colt Special revolver lay at her feet. It appeared someone had attempted to clean up the blood with a diaper found in the guest bathroom.  Spector's attorneys argued that Clarkson  was depressed over a recent breakup, grabbed the gun and  took her own life.  But prosecution witnesses painted Spector as a gun-toting menace, with five women telling harrowing tales on the witness stand of the music producer threatening them with firearms. Spector's driver testified he heard a loud noise and saw the producer leave the home, pistol in hand, saying, \"I think I killed somebody.\"  At issue was whether Spector pulled the trigger -- or whether Clarkson did. In photos projected on a large screen, the gruesome crime scene resembled a set decorated for a horror film.  In all, 77 witnesses testified and more than 600 pieces of evidence were submitted. The evidence cart wheeled into the jury room was piled high with exhibits.  The jury even toured the scene of the alleged crime.  The experts' testimony differed widely on what the physical evidence showed.  Prosecutors pointed to the leopard print purse slung over Clarkson's shoulder as evidence she was trying to leave when she was shot.  The defense argued that blood-spatter evidence on the white women's jacket Spector wore showed he was standing too far away to place the gun in Clarkson's mouth.  Spector hired and fired a who's who of legal talent for his defense. High profile defense attorneys who have left the case include Leslie Abramson and Bruce Cutler.  He also changed hairstyles several times during the trial, and wore flamboyant clothing, including frock coats and pastel-colored ties and pocket handkerchiefs.

{"article": "London, England (CNN) -- The iconic Abbey Road music studios made famous by the Beatles are not for sale, the music label that owns them said Sunday, after days of speculation that they were.  It is seeking a partner to help pay for upgrades, according to Terra Firma, which controls EMI, owner of the recording studios.  \"EMI confirms that it is holding preliminary discussions for the revitalization of Abbey Road with interested and appropriate third parties,\" Terra Firma said.  But that does not mean the studios are for sale, it added.  \"In mid-2009, we did receive an offer to buy Abbey Road for in excess of \u00a330 million (currently about $46 million), but this was rejected since we believe that Abbey Road should remain in EMI's ownership,\" the music company said in a statement.  The studios became world famous when the Beatles were photographed crossing the road there for the cover of their album \"Abbey Road.\"  But it's not only where the Beatles recorded \"All You Need is Love\" and numerous other songs, but where much of Britain's best known music of the 20th century was laid down.  Rock stars Pink Floyd and Cliff Richard, composer Sir Edward Elgar, and the movie soundtracks for \"Star Wars\" and the \"Harry Potter\" films were recorded there.  English Heritage, a cultural institution, is considering plans to list the studios as a site of national historic importance, Terra Firma said. That would give it protected status.  \"EMI... supports such a listing as an appropriate way of protecting our world famous music heritage site,\" the company said Sunday.  Terra Firma bought EMI in 2007.  Andrew Lloyd Webber, the composer of \"Phantom of the Opera\" and \"Cats\" and one of Britain's richest men, is \"very interested\" in buying the studios, a representative said Friday.  \"He first recorded there in 1967 with Tim Rice. Andrew has since recorded most of his musicals there,\" said the representative, Jenni Pain.  \"He thinks it is vital that the studios are saved for the future of the music industry in the UK. Abbey Road has such great facilities, with three major recording studios, and Andrew has probably brought more musicians to record there than anyone else, because it has the capacity to record large orchestral productions.\"  CNN's Per Nyberg and Morgan Neill contributed to this report.", "Q": ["Q: Name the music label that owns studios A:", "Q: Beatles made studios famous with what album?

{"article": " -- Bastian Schweinsteiger rescued a point for Bayern Munich as the German Bundesliga leaders were held to a 1-1 draw by Cologne on Saturday.  The Germany international grabbed an equalizer for Bayern in the 58th minute as Louis van Gaal's side missed the opportunity to increase their lead at the top of the table.  Bayern had looked to be heading for their first defeat since November after former striker Lukas Podolski, who had earlier hit the post, gave Cologne the lead at the RheinEnergieStadion.  Podolski struck a superb free-kick in the 32nd minute which deflected off goalkeeper Hans-Jorg Butt's hand and into the top-left corner of the net.  But the impressive Thomas Mueller set up midfielder Schweinsteiger and he stroked the ball home from just inside the penalty area to secure a point for Bayern.  Schalke are hot on the heels of the leaders after they cruised to a 4-1 win at Eintracht Frankfurt to close the gap to two points thanks to goals from Joel Matip, Benedikt Howedes Ivan Rakitic and Kevin Kuranyi.  Marcell Jansen scored the only goal of the game to ensure Hamburg remain in touch with the top three as they claimed a 1-0 win over Hertha Berlin at the HSH Nordbank Arena which left Hertha rooted to the bottom of the table.  Stuttgart threw away a two-goal lead as they drew 2-2 with Werder Bremen. Sami Khedira and Pavel Pogrebnyak gave the visitors a 2-0 half-time advantage but Portugal striker Hugo Almeida pulled a goal back for Bremen before Torsten Frings leveled with nine minutes remaining.  Elsewhere, Wolfsburg scored four second-half goals as they came from behind to a record a 4-1 win over Bochum thanks to a brace from Edin Dzeko and a goal apiece from Obafemi Martins and Jonathan Santana.  Hannover clinched a vital three points over fellow relegation strugglers Freiburg with a 2-1 away victory as Papiss Demba Cisse put through his own net for the home side after Yacine Abdessadki had equalized Elson's opener for the visitors.  In the day's late kick-off Borussia Dortmund kept up the chase for the Europa League with a routine 3-0 home victory over Borussia Monchengladbach.

{"article": "Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Four militants armed with guns and grenades stormed a mosque in Rawalpindi frequented by military personnel, killing dozens of people Friday -- most of them children, the military said.  The attack is the latest to shake the garrison city since this year's launch of strong military offensives against Taliban insurgents in the Swat Valley and South Waziristan. Rawalpindi is the headquarters of the Pakistani army.  Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas said Friday's assault killed 36 people and wounded 75.  Among the dead were 17 children, according to the military's Web site. Also killed were an army general and eight other military officials, six of them of senior rank. The remaining fatalities were adults.  \"As soon as the mosque's security staff checked me, there was a blast and then a finger hit me, then there was another,\" Ishtiaq, a driver for a military officer, told GEO TV.  Ishtiaq, who uses only one name, was attending midday prayers.  Rawalpindi is near Islamabad, and the mosque is near national army headquarters. It is located inside a walled residential compound where many military families have homes.  A witness told GEO TV there were up to 300 worshippers at the mosque at the time of the attack.  The militants hurled grenades before opening fire, Rawalpindi Police Chief Aslam Tareen told CNN. He said all the militants died, but he doesn't know how.  \"These are not militants,\" Abbas said. \"These are terrorists who killed innocent worshippers.\"  Retired Gen. Muhammad Yousaf was killed in the attack, said Col. Baseer Haider, a military spokesman. He said Yousaf was a former vice chief of army staff who was second in command during the administration of President Pervez Musharraf.  Abbas said two of the attackers were suicide bombers who blew themselves up inside the Parade Lane mosque; the other two were shot and killed by security forces outside the mosque.  Several explosions were heard inside the mosque around 1:30 p.m. (3:30 a.m. ET), followed by gunfire, Abbas said. The militants entered the compound by climbing over a wall, Tareen said.  This is the first attack in Rawalpindi since a suicide bomber targeted a bank on November 2.

{"article": "Editor's note: William Jelani Cobb is Associate Professor of History at Spelman College, and author of the forthcoming \"Change Has Come: Barack Obama and the Meaning of Progress.\" He blogs at http://americanexception.com/  William Jelani Cobb says Somalia's piracy problem was fueled by environmental and political events.  (CNN) -- The drama of an American ship captain held hostage by Somali pirates led last Sunday's talk shows.  Just hours before Maersk Alabama Capt. Richard Phillips was rescued, the piracy incident was discussed as one of the \"tests\" of President Obama that Joe Biden warned about during the campaign.  Others wondered whether wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have stretched our military resources too thin to respond effectively to these kinds of provocations. Many expressed outrage at the brand of naval gangsterism that by some estimates generated as much as $80 million in 2008.  Clearly this escalating pattern of pirate attacks may soon constitute an international crisis. But what this situation actually reveals is how little we've learned in the nearly eight years since George W. Bush declared war on terror.  Somalia is like Afghanistan in that we had a great deal of interest in the place during the Cold War and more or less forgot about it afterward. The United States supported the government of Said Barre during the 1980s primarily for the same reason we began funneling aid to the Afghan rebels: anticommunism.  Barre was a regional counterpoint to the Marxist regime next door in Ethiopia and strategically important enough for his human rights abuses to be tolerated. And like Afghanistan, Somalia quickly fell into disarray after the Cold War ended and the United States cut off support.  During the early post-Cold War era, the United States developed a more narrowly defined set of interests and it was common to hear American foreign policy circles express disdain for \"nation-building\" projects. But two decades later we continue to deal with the consequences of our abrupt exit from both countries.  Our fleeting humanitarian concern with Somalia ended with the downing of two Blackhawk helicopters in 1993. But that incident actually served as a kind of foreshadowing and highlighted yet another link to Afghanistan: The forces that attacked American troops in Mogadishu were reportedly linked to al Qaeda.  The 9/11 attacks and Afghanistan's role in sheltering al Qaeda should have given us reason to re-examine other regions where similar blowback might take place. In short, we might well have looked at what was going on in Afghanistan after September 11, 2001, and seen trouble on the horizon elsewhere.  The Somali situation was further complicated by a series of economic and ecological problems that have struck the region in the past decade. In the wake of the government collapse, the Somali coast became a target of illegal commercial fishing. This is a problem across East and Southern Africa but rampant in Somalia. According to one report, some 700 vessels were illegally operating in the region and fishing the local stock to near depletion.  As recently as 2006 Somali fishermen complained to the U.N. that illegal fishing was driving them to the brink of economic collapse. To add to the burden, the coast also became a favorite locale for nuclear waste dumping.  In 2005, U.N. officials confirmed that barrels containing illegally dumped nuclear waste had cracked open during the tsunami that year and begun washing ashore. The situation was widely reported by international news outlets with virtually no consequences.  No matter what we think of their current methods, it's impossible to solve the piracy problem without addressing the illegal fishing issue. Somalia lacks a functioning navy -- or government. Similarly, we were not talking about the over-fishing and nuclear waste issues -- to the extent we do talk about them now -- before the Somalis began to respond in kind.  These environmental violations will undoubtedly cost lives and the West has more or less ignored Somali pleas. Our intense and highly selective outrage began when the Somalis started targeting commercial vehicles.  Faced with this response it's hard to avoid the conclusion that the Western consumer products, carried by these ships are more valuable than Somali lives.  Given the recent history of unstable states like Afghanistan and Iraq, piracy is actually one of the milder problems we could have expected from the region. In a worst-case scenario, the region could become an incubator for terrorist cells or a depot for training international jihadists -- if it hasn't already.  Resolving this problem will likely involve precisely the kind of nation-building the United States once disdained and are now engaged in with Afghanistan. They amount to the back-end costs of the Cold War.  These pirates are not romantic heroes and their actions have generated an entirely different set of problems in Somalia, but they have our attention. In light of this incident we should recognize there are two sets of victims here: innocent workers taken hostage by pirates and those people living along the poisoned and depleted Somali coast who may well see these pirates as heroes.  We should also know that part of combating terrorism means addressing the conditions in which it flourishes. Extortion and kidnapping on the high seas is certainly wrong, but by ignoring the dumping of nuclear waste and the threats to the regional food supply, we effectively created a niche for these pirates. And Capt. Phillips' ordeal is a clear signal that humanitarian concerns are not the soft aspects of foreign policy, but rather the key to protecting our national interests abroad.

Roy Hodgson's men went into the away game needing victory to leapfrog their opponents and join Group E winners AS Roma in the last 32 of Europe's second-tier club competition.  Fulham were led by striker Bobby Zamora, who capped a recent scoring spree with two goals just before halftime.  Basel hit back with a disputed penalty before Zoltan Gera put Fulham 3-1 ahead with a neat finish.

{"article": " -- The pilot of a Boeing 737 was in the cockpit, preparing to take off with 101 passengers, when police arrested him for flying with a fake pilot's license, investigators said.  The 41-year-old Swedish man was poised to fly on Tuesday night from Amsterdam, in the Netherlands, to Ankara, Turkey, when investigators \"caught the pilot red-handed during his flight preparation,\" according to a statement from the Dutch National Police Services Agency.  Authorities charged him with forgery and flying without a valid license, the statement said.  It's apparently not the first time the man, whose identity was not divulged, has tried to fly without a license.  Investigators in Sweden charged the man several years ago with flying with a fake license, but they did not pursue the case because they couldn't find him, said Anders Lundblad, a spokesman for the Swedish Transport Agency.  The Swedes got a tip recently that the man was flying for a Turkish company and that he would soon be in the Netherlands, Lundblad said. They passed that information to Dutch police, which led to the pilot's arrest at the Schiphol airport in Amsterdam.  The man said he had flown for 13 years for companies in Belgium, Great Britain and Italy, the Dutch police said, though it was unclear whether he had a license for all or part of that time.  He recently had a valid license to fly small commercial airplanes, but that license had expired and would not have allowed him to fly passenger aircraft, the Dutch statement said.  Lundblad also said the man once had a valid pilot's license.  \"Why he never renewed it I guess only he knows,\" he said.

{"article": "ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN)  -- In Pakistan's combustible Swat Valley, some girls refuse to wear uniforms so they can make it to school without being harmed.  Shiza Shahid, left, a 20-year-old Stanford University student, is helping to teach young girls in Pakistan.  Other girls hide textbooks in their shawls to escape harassment.  School-age girls are among the victims in the fierce fighting between government soldiers and Taliban militants in the Swat Valley. The Pakistani government said it has flushed much of the Taliban out of the area, but some fighting persists.  Many girls remain banned from schools. Dozens of their schools have been bombed, and militants have burned books.  A new program has taken 26 girls out of the battle-scarred region to Islamabad for a 10-day retreat, where they can learn in safer surroundings.  A group of college students of Pakistani background is helping the girls. Among them are Shiza Shahid, 20, from California's Stanford University, who organized the program called Shajar-e-llm, or Tree of Knowledge.  Shahid said she was moved to help after hearing about how the girls struggled to get an education.  \"I think we were so angry, upset and emotional that we decided we have to do something,\" she said.  Watch as Shahid says she had to act to help the girls \u00bb  Though well-intentioned, the program sometimes seems disorganized.  \"We need support. We need unfortunately more organization, more of the bureaucratic nitty-gritty that you don't want to do, but you have to,\" Shahid said. \"We are young, and that does come with the burden as not being equally trusted or seen as capable.\"  Nonetheless, the group has ambitions for a boys' learning retreat as well.  The lessons are simple enough -- confidence-building exercises, critical-thinking lessons -- all framed in the context of Islamic values.  The girls -- ages 11 to 14 -- spoke about their dreams. One wants to meet a poet; another wants to learn calligraphy. Another wants to grow up to lead Pakistan.  \"I want to become president and rule this country in a good way,\" said 12-year-old Malila.  One day during the retreat, the girls were taught a song about freedom of speech. As a guitarist strummed, the girls sang that God gives everyone the right to free speech and no one can take it away.  Free speech seemed to end with the song, however. The girls could not risk talking about Taliban harassment, because the militants' version of Islamic law lingers. Such Islamic law, or shariah, also keeps females from going to school or going outside without their husbands.  The United Nations estimates that 375,000 Swat Valley residents fled their homes during fighting that started in April. In all, 2.5 million Pakistanis were displaced in what was said to be one of the largest human migrations in recent history.  Many residents have returned to their homes, but peace has not been completely restored to the region.  And soon, the girls at the learning retreat will return home to the Swat Valley as well.  Organizers said they hope the girls will carry a new love for education.  \"There were tears and there were tough moments,\" said Madihah Akhter, a volunteer with the program. \"But the girls surprised me. They were really resilient. They were beyond their years.\"", "Q": ["Q: What university does a student leader attend? A:", "Q: What were schoolgirls victims of?

{"article": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- The organist on the seminal 1960s song \"A Whiter Shade of Pale\" has won a long-running legal battle for a share in the royalties for the tune.  Matthew Fisher, shown here in a 2006 photo, has won a battle over \"Whiter Shade of Pale\" royalties.  Matthew Fisher sued former Procol Harum bandmate Gary Brooker in the House of Lords, Britain's highest court.  A lower court had ruled in his favor in 2006, granting him co-writing credits and a share of the royalties. Another court partly overturned the ruling in 2008, giving Fisher co-writing credit but no money.  The Court of Appeal said Fisher had waited too long to bring his claim to court. The House of Lords disagreed, said there was no time limit on such claims.  Fisher -- whose organ chords open the anthemic song and carry the psychedelic tune through its final swells -- says on his Web site that the song is the most-played ever on the books of Phonographic Performance Ltd.  Lord David Neuberger of Abbotsbury said the organist had played a key role in the success of the song.  \"Fisher's subsequent contribution was significant, and, especially the introductory eight bars, an important factor in the work's success,\" he wrote in his verdict.  The ruling could be worth a lot of money to him.  BBC television, for example, pays \u00a343.89 ($72.40) per minute in royalties each time it plays the four-minute song, according to PRS for Music, which collects royalties on behalf of music writers, composers and publishers  BBC Radio 2 pays \u00a319.35 ($31.92) per minute.

{"article": " -- Ferrari president Luca di Montezemolo has revealed that he believes seven-time Formula One world champion Michael Schumacher will come out of retirement and join the new Mercedes team.  The German has been a consultant with Ferrari, for whom he won five of his drivers' crowns, since he ended his career in 2006.  He almost got back behind the wheel for the Italian marque this year as a replacement for the injured Felipe Massa, but his comeback was cut short due to the lingering effects of a neck injury suffered in a motorbike accident.  However, the 40-year-old is now reportedly ready to return alongside compatriot Nico Rosberg for 2010 with German manufacturer Mercedes, who took a controlling interest in 2009's double world champions Brawn.  Di Montezemolo told reporters at Ferrari's Christmas lunch in Fiorano that Schumacher was close to sealing a deal, the UK Press Association reported.  \"I hadn't spoken to him since Abu Dhabi but I spoke to him on Wednesday,\" Di Montezemolo said. \"He phoned me and he told me that there is a very, very, very strong possibility [of joining Mercedes].  \"Having said that, it is not 100 percent decided. But that is what he said.\"  Schumacher is poised to end a 13-year association with Ferrari if he joins Mercedes.  \"The real Schumacher, the one I know, will remain forever part of the Ferrari family,\" Di Montezemolo told Ferrari's official Web site.  \"I said it in Monza and I repeated it in Abu Dhabi, but, it seems he has a twin brother, identical in every way, who seems to have it in his head to go and race in Formula One with Mercedes.  \"I don't know him personally, but it seems we have nothing to offer him -- we have two young drivers in Felipe Massa and Fernando Alonso, on whom we are counting to deliver a lot next year.  \"I think that, this summer, when I asked him to stand in for Felipe, after the terrible accident in Budapest, he suddenly rediscovered the desire to race and the fact he was unable to follow through with that, left him a void that we are unable to fill.  \"I remember how despondent he sounded on the evening of August 9, when he called me to say that the problem with his neck meant he could not race in Valencia.  \"We have tried to move forward with the idea of running a third car, but for the moment, that is not possible.

{"article": " -- Remember the iPod Nano and iPod Touch? They'll be getting some feature and style upgrades, as well as some price-slashing, in the near future.  Although the iPods were largely overshadowed by Tuesday's iPhone 4S news, Apple CEO Tim Cook also announced a handful of tweaks to Apple's iconic music-player line -- in plenty of time, of course, for the holiday shopping season.  The new Touch, now the most popular iPod, will be available in both black and white and get a $30 price cut, to $199 for 8GB of storage, $299 for 32 gigs and $399 for 64.  It will also run Apple's new iOS5 operating system, meaning its ability to run apps, surf the Web and the like will maintain its unofficial status as the iPhone-without-a-phone. The new Touch ships on October 12.  The Nano, perhaps appropriately, is getting an even smaller update. The most fun change will be Apple's addition of 16 new clock faces for folks who use the tiny player's 1.5-inch screen as a watch. Our favorite? The iconic Mickey Mouse watch is now available, with Mickey's hands spinning around to tell the time.  It's also getting a price cut, down to $129 for the 8GB version and $149 for 16GB. The runt of the litter, the 2GB Nano, goes for a mere $49. (Virtually free by Apple's standards, if still more expensive than some rival mp3 players with the same limited storage space).  Totally lost in the shuffle (see what we did there?) was any mention at all of the iPod Classic or... Shuffle.  The two didn't get a single mention at Tuesday's event, just as they were left out in the cold at last year's iPod event.  That's led to lots of stories in the tech press speculating that the clock is ticking toward the demise of the two venerable players. (You know... even if this one, from The Unofficial Apple Weblog, was dead wrong).  But Apple's online store Wednesday showed both devices still for sale.  It's clear Apple wants to move completely to touchscreen and abandon the old-fashioned click wheel on the Classic and Shuffle (the Nano's click wheel disappeared last year).  Time will tell how long the older devices last, although for our money there's still something to be said for the top-of-the-line Classic, with its massive 160 gigabytes of storage, as a repository for folks' entire music collection.  Music and other media content got another boost Tuesday with Apple announcing plans that could move iTunes into the cloud.  The iCloud service will now be integrated into the iOS 5 operating system. It will work with apps and allow content to be stored on remote servers instead of the users' iPod, iPhone or other device. Each device will get 5GB of free storage, according to Cook.  Working with iTunes, the cloud-based service would let a user access their music, videos and the like from any Apple device running iOS5.", "Q": ["Q: What saw price cuts A:", "Q: What will be an integrated part of the new OS?

{"article": "FLINT, Michigan (CNN) -- Sen. Barack Obama Monday proposed spending billions to revitalize the nation's economy, a plan the campaign of his likely Republican opponent said would slow economic growth with higher taxes.  Sen. Barack Obama wants to spend $60 billion on America's infrastructure.  During an economic speech in Flint, Michigan, Obama promised to spend billions to improve America's education, infrastructure, energy and health care systems.  To improve America's competitiveness, the senator from Illinois said he wants to spend $10 billion on childhood education, $150 billion over 10 years on developing alternative energy and $60 billion over 10 years to build \"21st century infrastructure.\"  Obama said he would pay for these programs by ending the war in Iraq, reducing government waste, charging polluters for greenhouse gas emissions and ending the Bush tax cuts for wealthy individuals.  During his speech in Michigan, a state hard hit by the decline of the American automobile industry, Obama also rejected protectionist trade polices that many unions say would help protect American jobs, saying \"it is impossible to turn back the tide of globalization.\"   Watch Obama call for America to compete in the global economy \u00bb  Obama said he disagreed with those who want to \"build a fortress around America; to stop trading with other countries, shut down immigration, and rely on old industries.\"  \"Not only is it impossible to turn back the tide of globalization, but efforts to do so can make us worse off,\" Obama said. \"Rather than fear the future, we must embrace it. I have no doubt that America can compete -- and succeed -- in the 21st century.\"  A McCain spokesman attacked Obama's plan, saying the Democrat's \"agenda to raise taxes and isolate America from foreign markets will not get our economy back on track or create new jobs.\"  \"To help create jobs in America, we need to lower taxes and open up foreign markets to American goods,\" said McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds. \"Americans cannot afford Barack Obama's 'change' that takes us back to the failed policies of the past.\"  But Obama said now was the time to commit to long-term investments in America's future and blasted McCain for wanting to continue President Bush's economic policies, saying \"there is a clear choice in this election. Instead of reaching for new horizons, George Bush has put us in a hole, and John McCain's policies will keep us there. I want to take us in a new and better direction.  \"I reject the belief that we should either shrink from the challenge of globalization or fall back on the same tired and failed approaches of the last eight years,\" he said. \"It's time for new policies that create the jobs and opportunities of the future -- a competitiveness agenda built upon education and energy, innovation and infrastructure, fair trade and reform.\"  The two campaigns have been sparring over who would be a better steward of America's ailing economy, and both candidates have been reaching out to blue-collar voters, many of whom backed Republican President Ronald Reagan over the Democrats, in part, because of cultural issues.  \"I believe that there are stark differences between myself and Sen.

{"article": "WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Flowers arrived at Capt. Marissa Alexander's office at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, on June 3, 2005.  Arlington's Section 60 is the final resting place for many casualties of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Her husband, Staff Sgt. Leroy Alexander, was half a world away fighting with the Special Forces in Afghanistan, but he had found a way to send a floral arrangement to his wife, who was five months pregnant with twins.  \"He called me and asked me what building I worked in. He said he had to update some records,\" Alexander said. The flowers lifted her spirits.  But a few hours later, her emotions would be thrown into a tailspin. Alexander saw two Army officers in dress uniforms knock on her front door.  One of the officers started to talk: \"We regret to inform you...\"  If he said any more, Alexander doesn't remember. \"The next memory I have is in my kitchen, banging on the floor. I just couldn't believe it,\" she said.  The good feelings from flowers delivered a few hours before were gone, replaced by shock, pain and mourning.  A roadside bomb had made her a widow.  Staff Sgt. Alexander now lies in Arlington National Cemetery's Section 60, where 500 soldiers, Marines, airmen and sailors who have died in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried.  For years Section 60 has been the one of busiest parts of the cemetery. Every day new burials bring precision marches, the somber tones of taps and the nerve-rattling three-gun salutes.  Watch how widows connect at Section 60 \u00bb  Then there are family and friends who come to the graves to make an emotional connection to their lost loved ones.  Memorial Day weekend brings even more activity and more visitors. Adults, even some uniformed generals, walk slowly between the rows and rows of headstones, looking for a familiar name. But small children often seem to find the cemetery a place to explore, even play. Their smiles and curiosity remind grown-ups that even in a place synonymous with death, life goes on.  A sense of community has emerged in Section 60.  \"I've come here at times and I've met people who were paying remembrances to their loved ones. You become friendly,\" Capt. Alexander said. \"You see each other sometimes and you make a friendship because you know that your loved ones died for the same cause.\"  Angie Capra's husband is buried a few yards from Leroy Alexander. Air Force Tech Sgt. Anthony Capra was an explosive ordnance disposal expert, killed trying disarm a bomb in Iraq.  \"Other widows will come by and put something on there for me if they don't see me. They'll put down flowers. It's kind of a community,\" Capra said.  More than flowers adorn the graves in Section 60. Visitors of all faiths have picked up the ancient Jewish tradition of leaving a small stone on the headstones to show that a visitor had been to the grave. In most cases these are pebbles found near the grave. But some people have taken to leaving colored glass beads or elaborately painted stones with shamrocks or words like \"hero.\"  View images from Section 60 \u00bb  Capra recently found a small Yoda figure on her husband's grave. She doesn't know who left it, but it must have been a friend, because her husband loved \"Star Wars.\"  \"We never know who puts stuff\" on the headstone, she said.  Some mementos leave one to wonder about the story behind them. Like the headstone topped by a tiny bottle of Tabasco hot sauce. Or a set of dog tags with a name that didn't match the name on the headstone.  Watch how friends say goodbye to a fallen soldier \u00bb  There is another topped by a small Lego toy, perhaps left by a child whose father died in a far-off land before they even knew each other. Or the grave adorned with an empty bottle of Bud Light, a rubber duck and a candle.  Nearby an empty Wild Turkey bottle is the lone addition to the grave of a soldier who died in a country where drinking alcohol is strictly forbidden.  Capra has found a variety of items on Tony's headstone.  \"Coins, lots of rocks, candy. My husband was a candy freak,\" Capra said. \"There was a cross. A little necklace, Mardi Gras beads during Mardi Gras season. Anything they have they'll put on top to show that they are thinking about them at the time.\"  Alexander seems to draw strength from the items she finds.  \"Someone came and did a picture of Lee, and it was a hand-drawn picture. I thought that was very interesting,\" she said.  \"People who haven't been seen in years will leave a note of some sort. It's nice to know that you've been remembered after all of this time.

{"article": "Kenner, Louisiana (CNN) -- A \"black rain\" of drilling fluid and a roar of escaping gas erupted from the doomed Deepwater Horizon shortly before the explosion that sank the oil rig, the captain of a nearby ship testified Tuesday.  Alwin Landry's supply vessel Damon Bankston was alongside Deepwater Horizon at the time of the blast. Landry said the first sign of trouble was when drilling \"mud\" -- a mixture used to pressurize and lubricate the drills -- began falling onto the stern of his ship.  \"We essentially closed the wheelhouse doors. I went to the port side, and I looked out up at the derrick. That's when I see the mud coming out of the top of the derrick,\" Landry told investigators Tuesday.  When he radioed the rig's bridge, Landry said, its captain told him there were problems with the well and he should move his ship away. Seconds later, he said, he heard \"the percussion and the slight flash of green\" of an explosion.  Deepwater Horizon sank April 22, two days after the explosion. The blast left 11 people aboard the rig presumed dead and uncorked a gusher of oil that has been spewing an estimated 210,000 gallons (5,000 barrels) of crude oil a day into the Gulf of Mexico.  Landry's testimony came on the first of two days of hearings by a joint Coast Guard-Interior Department panel.  His ship picked up the rig's survivors, and Landry said the rig's captain, Curt Kutcha, told him he had tried to activate a \"kill switch\" that would cut off the well before abandoning the structure.  The crew did not know whether it was working when they fled the burning rig, Landry told investigators.  The federal Minerals Management Service, the Interior Department agency that oversees offshore oil exploration, inspects drill rigs once a month, MMS inspector Eric Neal told the panel. Test results from the rig's blowout preventer, a massive device meant to cut off the well in an emergency, and drilling mud weights are reviewed as part of that process, he said.  Neal inspected the rig April 1 and found no violations, he testified. But he did not inspect the preventer's emergency disconnect system, he said.  The companies involved in the drilling process are blaming each other for the disaster.  The chairman of well owner BP's American subsidiary, Lamar McKay, told a U.S. Senate committee Tuesday that rig owner/operator Transocean was responsible for the rig's operation and for testing its blowout preventer.  But Transocean CEO Steven Newman told the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee that the well's cementing, or the casing that holds the well in place, must have failed. BP, as the well's owner, was responsible for designing the casing, while oilfield services contractor Halliburton performed the cementing.  \"Without a failure of one of those elements, the explosion could not have occurred,\" Newman said.  And Halliburton's chief safety and environmental officer, Tim Probert, told the committee that responsibility lay with either Transocean or BP.  During the cementing of the well, Halliburton simply followed BP's instructions, he said, and the blowout preventer was Transocean's responsibility.", "Q": ["Q: When did the rig sink?

{"article": "West Point, New York (CNN) -- President Obama said Tuesday that the deployment of 30,000 additional U.S. troops to Afghanistan is part of a strategy to reverse the Taliban's momentum and stabilize the country's government.  \"There is no imminent threat of the government being overthrown, but the Taliban has gained momentum,\" Obama said at the U.S. Military Academy. \"Al Qaeda has not re-emerged in Afghanistan in the same numbers as before 9/11, but they retain their safe-havens along the border.  \"And our forces lack the full support they need to effectively train and partner with Afghan security forces and better secure the population.... In short, the status quo is not sustainable.\"  Obama said he'd begin sending the additional troops \"at the fastest pace possible\" starting in early 2010 \"with a goal of starting to withdraw forces from the country in July 2011.\"  The president said additional U.S. forces bolstered by NATO troops \"will allow us to accelerate handing over responsibility to Afghan forces.\"  Senior administration officials said Tuesday that Obama has a goal of withdrawing most U.S. forces by the end of his current term, which ends in January 2013.  Watch what the new troops will do in Afghanistan  It will be the second increase of U.S. forces in the war-torn Islamic country ordered by Obama since he took office in January.  In his speech Tuesday, Obama said his strategy had three objectives:  \u2022 Deny al Qaeda a safe haven  \u2022 Reverse the Taliban's momentum and deny it the ability to overthrow Afghanistan's government  \u2022 Strengthen Afghanistan's security forces and government  The additional troops was one way to achieve these, he said. Other strategies will include holding Afghan government leaders accountable for corruption, focus assistance on areas that could help the lives of Afghans, and securing the country's border with Pakistan.  \"We are in Afghanistan to prevent a cancer from once again spreading through that country. But this same cancer has also taken root in the border region of Pakistan. That is why we need a strategy that works on both sides of the border,\" Obama said.  The president said he rejected the option of committing more forces for an undefined mission of nation-building without any deadlines.  \"I reject this course because it sets goals that are beyond what we can achieve at a reasonable cost, and what we need to achieve to secure our interests,\" Obama said. \"Furthermore, the absence of a timeframe for transition would deny us any sense of urgency in working with the Afghan government. It must be clear that Afghans will have to take responsibility for their security, and that America has no interest in fighting an endless war in Afghanistan.\"  Obama rejected analogies with the war in Vietnam that divided America in the 1960s and 1970s.  \"Unlike Vietnam, we are joined by a broad coalition of 43 nations that recognizes the legitimacy of our action,\" Obama said. \"Unlike Vietnam, we are not facing a broad-based popular insurgency. And most importantly, unlike Vietnam, the American people were viciously attacked from Afghanistan, and remain a target for those same extremists who are plotting along its border.\"  Obama said the U.S. has no interest in occupying Afghanistan.  \"We will support efforts by the Afghan government to open the door to those Taliban who abandon violence and respect the human rights of their fellow citizens,\" Obama said. \"And we will seek a partnership with Afghanistan grounded in mutual respect -- to isolate those who destroy; to strengthen those who build; to hasten the day when our troops will leave; and to forge a lasting friendship in which America is your partner, and never your patron.\"  Obama spoke to an audience of West Point cadets, staff and guests in outlining his strategy that he has deliberated for months, meeting several times with his national security team.  He recognized that some in the audience had fought in Afghanistan, and some would be deployed in the future.  \"As your commander in chief, I owe you a mission that is clearly defined, and worthy of your service,\" he said.  The additional U.S. forces \"will increase our ability to train competent Afghan security forces, and to partner with them so that more Afghans can get into the fight,\" Obama said.  \"And they will help create the conditions for the United States to transfer responsibility to the Afghans.\"  Obama also said he is asking NATO allies to provide more troops, and that he is \"confident that there will be further contributions in the days ahead.\"  \"Our friends have fought and bled and died alongside us in Afghanistan,\" he said. \"Now, we must come together to end this war successfully. For what's at stake is not simply a test of NATO's credibility -- what's at stake is the security of our allies, and the common security of the world.\"  The new troop deployment would increase the total U.S. commitment to roughly 100,000 troops in Afghanistan, bolstered by more than 40,000 NATO forces.  Obama, whom Republicans had accused of \"dithering\" over the decision, concluded the deployment needs to be accelerated to knock back the Taliban, the senior officials said.  The push for a speedy deployment is surprising because White House officials who defended Obama's slow pace of coming to a decision had said the Pentagon wouldn't be able to get new troops to Afghanistan that quickly.  A Pentagon official noted that, under the new strategy, Obama is \"trying to do it faster\" than the 12-month timeline initially requested by Gen. Stanley McChrystal, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan.  McChrystal wrote in a report in August that a \"failure to gain the initiative and reverse insurgent momentum in the near-term (next 12 months) -- while Afghan security capacity matures -- risks an outcome where defeating the insurgency is no longer possible.\"  The Pentagon official said Obama's six-month timeline for sending the new troops is \"very aggressive\" and will be challenging for the military to fulfill. The official expressed confidence, however, that the military would successfully carry out the order.  Opponents of an increased U.S. troop deployment complain that the government of Afghan President Hamid Karzai is corrupt and an unreliable partner.  Obama spoke to Karzai for an hour by videoconference Tuesday to discuss the deployment decision, according to a White House statement.  \"The president also emphasized that U.S. and international efforts in Afghanistan are not open-ended and must be evaluated toward measurable and achievable goals within the next 18 to 24 months,\" the statement said.  Share your views on Obama's Afghanistan decision  The decision to send the troops carries significant political risk for Obama, who will announce it nine days before he travels to Oslo, Norway, to accept the Nobel Peace Prize.  His liberal base, which helped him win last year's presidential election, opposes another troop deployment to Afghanistan.  In addition, the deployment, expected to cost an extra $30 billion a year, comes amid high unemployment as the economy emerges from a recession. That concerns Democrats and Republicans faced with competing domestic priorities such as health care reform and job creation.  U.S.-led troops first invaded Afghanistan in response to the al Qaeda terrorist network's September 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington. The invasion overthrew the ruling Taliban, which had allowed al Qaeda to operate from its territory, but most of the top al Qaeda and Taliban leadership escaped the onslaught.  Taliban fighters have since regrouped in the mountainous region along Afghanistan's border with Pakistan, battling U.S. and Afghan government forces on one side and Pakistani troops on the other. Al Qaeda's top leaders, Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri, remain at large and are suspected to be hiding in the same region.  The conflict has so far claimed the lives of more than 900 Americans and nearly 600 allied troops.", "Q": ["Q: In how many years does Obama want to remove troops A:", "Q: What types of troops will be deployed?

{"article": "Editor's note: Join Roland S. Martin for his weekly sound-off segment on CNN.com Live at 10:30 a.m. ET Wednesday. If you're passionate about politics, he wants to hear from you. A nationally syndicated columnist, Martin has said he will vote for Barack Obama in November. He is the author of \"Listening to the Spirit Within: 50 Perspectives on Faith\" and \"Speak, Brother! A Black Man's View of America.\" Visit his Web site for more information.  Roland S. Martin says Lifeway Christian Stores should be given hell for its actions against GospelToday.  (CNN) -- In the 19 years that Teresa Hairston has published her magazine, GospelToday, she has never faced a major situation with Christian bookstores across the country that carry the publication.  She's tackled any number of issues over the years,and has featured a number of celebrities and ministers, ranging from Yolanda Adams to Bishop T.D. Jakes to Kirk Franklin.  But when the Atlanta, Georgia, entrepreneur decided to feature five female pastors on her cover this month, she says, Lifeway Christian Stores treated her like she had converted her Christian publication to something akin to the tastes of porn purveyor Larry Flynt.  Apparently, the owner of Lifeway, the Southern Baptist Convention, wasn't too happy with Hairston telling the story of female pastors, because the women go against their 2000 decree that only men can serve in the role of reverend or pastor.  According to Hairston, the Christian company didn't even give her the courtesy of a heads-up.  \"We got an anonymous tip,\" she told me Tuesday on The Tom Joyner Morning Show, and after checking it out, she discovered that the magazine had been removed from the shelves in all of Lifeway's 100-plus stores nationwide and had been placed behind the counter.  \"They have never called me,\" Hairston said. \"Never sent an e-mail. Nothing. I had to go see my distributor to verify what they had done.\"  The actions of Lifeway didn't stun me. I had seen this movie before.  A few years ago, my wife was a longtime Lifeway teacher. She had taught at the company's teaching centers for years, but then one day, she was notified that she would have to take down her Web site and comply with their rules against female pastors or be dropped as a teacher. Her crime? Calling herself the Rev. Jacquie Hood Martin.  It wasn't that she did so for the heck of it. She graduated from Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary; was the first female staff pastor at Houston's Brookhollow Baptist Church/the Church Without Walls, a Southern Baptist Convention church; and has been leading folks to the Lord all over the country for 20 years.  She was angered by Lifeway's decision but made it clear that she didn't serve the bookstore or even the Southern Baptist Convention. She made a commitment to serving Jesus Christ and was not about to back away from her call to ministry because a male-dominated organization decided that its interpretation of the Bible calls for a woman not to be in the pulpit.  So she cut them off and kept on calling herself the Rev. Jacquie Hood Martin.  Religious folks will quickly say that Scripture is clear that women can't be pastors and lead men, yet Hairston says that when she featured Pastor Paula White on her cover two years ago, Lifeway didn't take any action against the magazine.  Anyone who has served in a church or been a member of any faith knows that there are those who have strict interpretations of their faith's writings, while others have a different interpretation.  I've heard Brookhollow's pastor, the Rev. Dr. Ralph Douglas West Sr., preach several sermons stating that what Paul wrote in 2 Timothy with regards to only men preaching was specific to that church and not a blanket ban. Second, there were instances where Paul wrote that his views were his own and not mandates from God.  That is a doctrinal fight that any of us can have any time (and I love it how these same Bible thumpers ignore the biblical story of Deborah, who was a judge in the Old Testament -- and was over men).  But what is a greater issue is that Lifeway clearly has no respect for freedom of the press. Here is arguably the top Christian bookstore in the country making a decision based on their teachings and applying it to a magazine. A spokesman for Lifeway Resources, which runs the stores, was quoted in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution last week as saying of female pastors, \"It is contrary to what we believe.\"  So does Lifeway and, by extension, the Southern Baptist Convention, fight vigorously for freedom of religion, but it doesn't give a hoot about the other freedoms guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution?  I now wonder whether Lifeway makes it its business to cull through any number of magazines and search for stories that go against its doctrine and pull them from the shelves.  This is the kind of nonsense that drives more people away from religion. I suppose it's fitting that this story would come out the same time as Bill Maher releases his religious documentary, \"Religulous,\" which skewers all the major religions for their dogma. I'm sure he feasted on positions of the Southern Baptist Convention.  The conduct of Lifeway and the Southern Baptist Convention is shameful, and they owe Hairston an apology for their actions. Yet she's taken it in stride, saying that instead of giving the company hell, she'll \"give them heaven.\"  I say, give them a lot of hell for this, because they deserve it for actions.

Transcript  THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.  CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: I'm Carl Azuz and this is CNN Student News! It is the first day of June and our last week before summer break. Thank you very much for joining us.  First Up: A Look Back  AZUZ: First up, a major move for the country's largest automaker as General Motors is expected to file for bankruptcy today. This comes one month after Chrysler, another of the so-called \"Big Three\" U.S. car companies, did the very same thing. Under the terms of General Motors' bankruptcy, the company will be reorganized and essentially taken over by the government. Thirty years ago, GM made up more than 40 percent of U.S. auto sales. Today, that number is 19 percent. The company's reported more than $90 billion in losses since 2005. As the bankruptcy process begins, Christine Romans looks back at the history of GM and the American car.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Henry Ford started at the beginning of the last century with four wheels and a running board; 1908 was the birth of American car culture. That same year, General Motors was formed in Flint, Michigan. It wasn't until 1925 when the \"Big Three\" was complete with the formation of Chrysler Corporation.  JOHN DAVIS, HOST, MOTORWEEK: When the Big Three emerged, they not only emerged as rivals that really gave Americans much better automobiles at the time, but they also cemented the American automobile as a world standard.  ROMANS: \"As goes General Motors, so goes the nation.\" That phrase defined America's economic power for much of the last century.  PETER MORICI, ECONOMIST, UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND: So many folks were either employed at General Motors or the other two major car makers, making steel and all the other components that go into cars. It just meant that if the automobile companies were prospering, the country was prospering, too.  ROMANS: Today, there are 74,000 rank-and-file GM workers in the U.S. But in its heyday, GM was the largest industrial company in the world; a technology leader. By 1979, 600,000 people worked for GM. Those good jobs helped build America's middle class.  DAVIS: It also allowed us to migrate out from the cities to have the quarter lot in a suburb, to basically get away from a lot of the congestion of the metropolitan areas.  ROMANS: General Moters was the company that revolutionized what we drove, how we thought about our cars, and how we paid for them. GM invented auto loans and the model year. It was the first to hire designers instead of engineers to create new car concepts; think big fins and chrome of the 1950s and 60s. And everything changed. Ford adopted flashy fins with the Ford Fairlane, as did Chrysler with the popular Desoto. Automobiles from the Big Three put their stamp on popular culture, from music to movies to television. What's considered to be the first rock and roll song ever recorded was \"Rocket 88\" by Ike Turner, about a GM product. The Pontiac GTO, considered by many to be the first true muscle car, was showcased in a song by Ronnie and the Daytonas.  RONNIE AND THE DAYTONAS, \"LITTLE GTO\": Little GTO, you really....  ROMANS: The Corvette on Route 66. The 1948 Ford in the iconic movie \"Grease.\"  FROM \"GREASE\": Go grease lighting, go grease lighting...  ROMANS: The TransAm in Smokey and the Bandit, and Archie Bunker's Old La Salle.  CARROLL O'CONNOR AND JEAN STAPLETON, \"ALL IN THE FAMILY\": Gee, our Old La Salle ran great. Those were the days...  (END VIDEO CLIP)  Shoutout  GEORGE RAMSAY, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Today's Shoutout goes out to Mr. Schultz's civics classes at David Brearley Middle School in Kenilworth, New Jersey. Where did the word \"cyberspace\" first appear? Was it in a: A)Movie, B) Book, C) Scientific paper or D) Magazine article? You've got three seconds -- GO! Author William Gibson is credited with creating the word in a science fiction novel. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout!  Cybersecurity Concerns  AZUZ: It may have started as science fiction, but these days, practically all of us, including the government, spend time in cyberspace. But President Obama says we're not as prepared as we should be, as a government or a country, for cyber-attacks. That's why he's planning to create a new position: cybersecurity coordinator. Jeanne Meserve explains the new job.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  JEANNE MESERVE, CNN HOMELAND SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Hackers cut power to a skyscraper and then reprogram it to play Space Invaders in a spoof video on YouTube. But cybersecurity is not a laughing matter.  U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: It's now clear this cyberthreat is one of the most serious economic and national security challenges we face as a nation.  MESERVE: Americans use the Internet to bank and shop and talk to one another. Electricity, water, transportation all depend on it. But every day, there are attacks. The White House estimates in the past two years cybercrime has cost Americans more than $8 billion. And last year alone, hackers stole one trillion dollars worth of business secrets. Military and intelligence networks have been penetrated, and tests have shown a cyberattack can destroy critical infrastructure, like this generator. President Obama says the country is not prepared.  OBAMA: From now on, our digital infrastructure, the networks and computers we depend on every day, will be treated as they should be: as a strategic national asset. Protecting this infrastructure will be a national security priority.  MESERVE: The president will hand pick a cybersecurity coordinator to integrate policies across government, work closely with the private sector, and coordinate the federal response to attacks. Still unknown: who will get the job.  JAMES LEWIS, CENTER FOR STRATEGIC AND INTERNATIONAL STUDIES: If you get the wrong person, or you put them in an office that doesn't have very much power, you can have the best plan in the world and it still won't work.  MESERVE: The plan is short on specifics, though the president says government will not dictate security standards to private industry, and will not monitor private networks or Internet traffic. Security experts say they generally like the steps the administration is taking, but warn there are many more steps to take on the long road to securing the nation's cyber-infrastructure. Jeanne Meserve, CNN, Washington.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  Big Ben's Birthday!  AZUZ: Heading across the Atlantic now to celebrate a big British birthday. Big Ben, one of the world's most famous clocks, turned 150 years old yesterday. Recently voted as Britain's favorite monument, it's actually just the 14-ton bell that's named \"Big Ben,\" although most people use it describe the tower and clock, too. Despite a couple disruptions over the years, Big Ben has helped keep London on time since 1859.  Extra, Extra Innings  AZUZ: This college baseball game didn't last quite 150 years, but it did go into extra innings; 16 of them! Texas and Boston College took the field at 7 p.m. and left it at 2 a.m. after playing the longest game in NCAA history: 25 innings, almost 3 full games. At one point, a relief pitcher threw 13 scoreless innings. In the end, an RBI single helped Texas triumph, 3-2.

There's one place in Atlanta, Georgia that's doing all of this: a school! Jacqui Jeras takes us on a tour of the campus's environmentally-friendly efforts.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  JACQUI JERAS, CNN WEATHER ANCHOR: The botany classroom is the great outdoors for students at the Lovett School in Atlanta.

MCCARTHY: It's much healthier for you, it's less chemicals, it's completely natural and it costs less.  JERAS: The school's organic garden is just the beginning.  ALEX REYNOLDS, SCIENCE TEACHER: The idea that your labor can then nourish you is a life lesson, you know, and the fact that you take responsibility. If you do something wrong, you have to fix it.  JERAS: Food from the garden goes to the cafeteria. Menus change depending on what's fresh. The dining hall is also trayless, saving thousands of gallons of water used to wash them. The cafeteria does more than just cook with sustainability in mind. For example, all of the oil that is used for fried foods is ultimately turned into biodiesel. That biofuel is used to fill up the school's maintenance vehicles for half the cost of gas. There is even a wind turbine on campus creating electricity. But the key is keeping the students involved.  BILL DUNKEL, PRINCIPAL, THE LOVETT SCHOOL: It's really important for us to educate young people to be good citizens for the 21st century.

{"article": "New York (CNN) -- Work on the National September 11 Memorial Museum has been halted over a budgetary dispute, delaying its opening, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg said.  \"There's no chance of it being open on time. Work has basically stopped,\" Bloomberg said during a press conference Thursday.  The museum was scheduled to open on the 11th anniversary of the September 11, 2001, terror attacks.  Bloomberg blamed the holdup on \"disagreements\" with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which is responsible for a portion of the project's financing.  \"The Port Authority has to spend money to do the infrastructure that they agreed to,\" the mayor said. \"We have a legitimate claim against the Port Authority for delays for roughly $140 million dollars which has increased our cost.\"  Bloomberg did not specify when work on the museum halted. The Port Authority did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Bloomberg's disclosure of the setback came the same day the National September 11 Memorial & Museum Foundation announced that more than a million people have visited the site since it opened on the 10th anniversary of the attacks.  The memorial features two large reflecting pools in the footprints of the two towers.  Located underground in the former World Trade Center's \"archaeological heart,\" the museum will feature 110,000 square feet of exhibition space, according to the website for The National September 11 Memorial & Museum foundation.  It will house a vast array of 9/11 artifacts, including \"photographs, videotapes, voice messages, recovered property, clothing and other personal effects, workplace memorabilia, [and] incident-specific documents,\" among other items.  Bloomberg sounded a note of optimism, telling reporters that both sides would come to \"some agreement pretty soon.\"  He also said he thought the disagreement would not require judges to resolve it. \"I don't think it'll get to the court.\"", "Q": ["Q: What does Bloomberg blame the delay on?

{"article": " -- The defense attorney appointed to represent an Alabama professor accused of shooting her colleagues said Friday he regrets describing her as \"wacko.\"  But at a news conference, Roy Miller said \"something's wrong with this lady.\"  He also said his client, Amy Bishop, is \"aware of what she's done and she's very sorry for it.\"  Bishop is under suicide watch in jail, Miller said.  In an interview Thursday with CNN affiliate WHNT after visiting Bishop, Miller said, \"I just think the case speaks for itself.\" He added, \"I think she's wacko.\"  At Friday's news conference, he referred to that remark.  \"Good lord, y'all,\" Miller said. \"Listen, I went overboard with that. When I talk to y'all I make statements... I wish I hadn't have made. And probably that's one of them.\"  He added that he was trying to imply that the facts of the case \"speak for themselves.\"  Bishop told him she does not remember the incident, Miller said.  But now, \"she knows she's killed some folks, I'm sure.\"  The biology professor is charged with capital murder and three counts of attempted murder in the shootings at the University of Alabama in Huntsville last week.  At the end of a biology department faculty meeting at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, Bishop suddenly \"just stood up and shot,\" a professor who survived the incident told CNN affiliate WAAY.  Three of Bishop's colleagues were killed; three others were wounded.  Bishop, a Harvard-trained geneticist, had recently been denied tenure.  Bishop, a professor and researcher at the university, was arrested as she was leaving the building. A 9 mm handgun was found inside, on the second floor.  A university spokesman, Ray Garner, identified the dead as Gopi Podila, chairman of the biological sciences department; Maria Davis, associate professor of biology; and Adriel Johnson, associate professor of biology.  Miller said his client is \"trying to keep from cracking up down there emotionally,\" and is worried that if she breaks down, officials in the jail might think she's going to commit suicide.  Discussing his client's mind, he said that doctors of biology \"have got, in my estimation, high IQs -- and the high IQ in my opinion is sometimes not good for people.\" He said Bishop sometimes is \"so focused on the mental basis\" that she \"does not know what's going on around her.\"  He said he believes the case will boil down to Bishop's mental state at the time of the killings.  In the wake of the shootings, information came to light about previous run-ins with the law Bishop had. She faced criminal charges after an altercation at a Massachusetts restaurant nearly eight years ago, police said. The police report says Bishop became furious that there was no booster seat available for her child, began screaming at the woman who had taken the last one and struck her in the head.  Authorities previously have said Bishop, who is also known as Amy Bishop Anderson, fatally shot her brother in the family's Braintree, Massachusetts, home in 1986.  The shooting was ruled accidental, but after a review of the incident after the Alabama shootings, Norfolk County District Attorney William Keating issued a statement saying that probable cause had existed in 1986 to charge Bishop with assault with a dangerous weapon, carrying a dangerous weapon and unlawful possession of ammunition.  However, the statute of limitations on those charges has expired, as well as on a potential charge of \"wanton and reckless conduct\" -- the lowest standard for manslaughter in Massachusetts, Keating said.  In addition, the Boston Globe reported Monday that Bishop and her husband, Jim Anderson, were questioned in the 1993 attempted mail bombing of a Harvard Medical School professor.  Jim Anderson said on Monday that federal investigators had gathered \"a dozen subjects\" in the attempted bombing, but \"there were never any suspects. Never anyone charged, never anyone arrested.

{"article": " -- CNN's Larry King talked with Republican Gov. Bobby Jindal in a prime-time exclusive interview Monday night.  Lousiana Gov. Bobby Jindal on Barack Obama: \"I'm certainly not nearly as good of a speaker as he is.\"  Jindal gave the Republican response after President Obama's address to Congress last week. Jindal received negative reviews after the speech, and Larry asked him how he felt about that. They also talked about the war of words in the Republican Party centered around Rush Limbaugh.  The following transcript has been edited for brevity and clarity:  Larry King: Governor, you took a lot of flak for that speech. Were you surprised that you did?  Gov. Bobby Jindal: Let's be clear, the president is a great speaker -- probably the greatest we've seen in a generation. I'm certainly not nearly as good of a speaker as he is. And I'm not the only one that's got that opinion.  I hope people look at the content of the speech, not just the delivery. You know, for years, I've been told I speak too quickly. Now I'm told I speak too slowly.  What's more important is I was outlining a philosophical difference with the stimulus package, with the leadership in Congress, with the administration. I was outlining a philosophical disagreement that says we need to get businesses hiring again. We need to put more money in the private sector.  Watch Larry King's interview with Gov. Bobby Jindal \u00c2\u00bb  Let's cut taxes. Let's get rid of the wasteful spending. That's the debate. That's the discussion we need to be having.  King: But governor, to say that the federal government apparently has no voice in this crisis, when in some cases, they are the only answer, that pointed to a lot of the criticism, didn't it?  Jindal: If the president had actually delivered the targeted temporary stimulus package that he described, I think you'd see a lot more conservative and Republican support. We absolutely agree with the kind of infrastructure spending he describes -- speeding up federal spending that would have happened anyway.  Less than 5 percent of this bill was actually [for] the shovel-ready infrastructure spending that he described. ...  Fundamentally, I don't think $30 million for the federal government to buy new cars, $1 billion for the Census, $50 million for the National Endowment for the Arts is going to get the economy moving again as quickly as allowing the private sector to create jobs.  King: There was no criticism of the Bush bailout of the automobile industry. No criticism of the last eight years of the Republican leadership with a tremendous deficit.  Jindal: Well, Larry, I think that you're absolutely right. One of the reasons the Republicans lost the elections in 2006 and 2008 is the Republican Party didn't match its actions with its rhetoric....  I think one of the reasons we lost elections was that the Republicans came to Washington to change the culture and instead became captive of that culture. The Republican Party defended spending and corruption we never would have accepted from the other side.  King: Governor, if perception is reality, do you think your speech hurt the party?  Jindal: I think that people are going to look at the content. I think people are going to be focused now that we've [got] alternative views on how to move our country forward.  Let me begin the first to say we want to work with the president every chance we can get. Whenever we can find areas of agreement, we need to work across the aisle and put America first.  But when we disagree, we need to offer principled alternative solutions. So for example, in health care, I agree with the president that health care should be affordable for every American. I just don't think it should be a government-run program.  King: All right, governor, here was Rush Limbaugh at this weekend's CPAC Conference. Watch.  Rush Limbaugh: What is so strange about being honest and saying I want Barack Obama to fail if his mission is to restructure and reform this country so that capitalism and individual liberty are not its foundation? Why would I want that to succeed?  King: Governor, do you think people are thinking about capitalism now or are they thinking about problems?  Jindal: Look, clearly, the American people are worried about paying their mortgages, keeping their jobs and paying their health care bills. I think Rush is a great leader for conservatives. I think he articulates what a lot of people are concerned about.  King: Do you want him [Obama] to fail?  Jindal: I don't want those policies to be adopted. I want my country to succeed, but I don't want policies to be adopted.  King: What if the policies work?  Jindal: Well, again...  King: What if they work?  Jindal: This is where we have a fundamental disagreement. I don't think it's going work... to spend in excess of our revenues.  I want my country to succeed. But what I worry about is that simply spending money on new programs. Look at every new bailout. You talked about the auto bailouts. Then you had the fourth, I think it's the fourth -- it's hard to keep track -- AIG bailout today. It seems like every time you turn around, there's another trillion dollar plan.  King: One more thing. It may be moot now, but RNC Chairman Michael Steele took some shots at Limbaugh and then apologized. What do you make of all of that?  Jindal: Well, I didn't follow the day's events. I'm glad he apologized. I think the chairman is a breath of fresh air for the party. As I said before, I think Rush is a leader for many conservatives and says things that people are concerned about. [He] articulates very well the concern people have about growing government spending without an end in sight.  King: Thanks, governor. We'll call on you again. Always good seeing you.

{"article": "NORFOLK, Virginia (CNN) -- Negotiators aboard a U.S. Navy warship are trying to secure the release of an American freighter captain who is being held by pirates on a lifeboat off the coast of Somalia, according to Maersk Line Ltd.  Capt. Richard Phillips of the Maersk Alabama is being held by pirates on a lifeboat off Somalia.  The crew aboard the destroyer USS Bainbridge could see the lifeboat where pirates have been holding Capt. Richard Phillips since Wednesday, the company said in a written statement issued at 5 p.m. ET.  Phillips has not been hurt, the statement said.  Phillips, who has received provisions and batteries for his radio, has been in touch with the crews of the Alabama and the Bainbridge, the statement said.  The pirates are the same four men who hijacked Phillips' vessel, the U.S.-flagged Maersk Alabama, early Wednesday hundreds of miles off the Horn of Africa.  The Alabama's 20-person crew later regained control of the ship, which is owned and operated by the Norfolk-based Maersk Line Ltd.  In a written statement, Maersk spokesman Kevin Speers noted that \"there have been many questions about how the crew re-captured the ship and how the captain came to leave the ship.\"  But he would not clarify the matter.  \"Our immediate focus has been to bring the current situation to a safe resolution,\" he said. \"There will be time for due diligence and retrospective review once we have the safe return of all parties and the opportunity for a full de-briefing.\"  The U.S. Navy, which is in charge of the situation, requested the help of the FBI. FBI negotiators in the United States are in touch with the crew of the Bainbridge, which arrived on the scene earlier Thursday to assist, a senior U.S. defense official said.  According to Maersk's last communication with the Navy, the 28-foot lifeboat was disabled and \"dead in the water,\" Speers said Thursday morning.  \"We are encouraged that most of the crew is safe. They have been resilient and courageous throughout this crisis,\" Speers said. \"But we will remain on watch, staffing our situation room and our family hot line until this situation is resolved and the captain is safely returned.\"  On Thursday, the Maersk Alabama resumed its journey to Mombasa, Kenya, with an 18-person armed security detail on board, according to Joseph Murphy, the father of the ship's first officer. Maersk and U.S. military officials confirmed the cargo ship had left the area on Thursday, but would not say where it was heading, citing security concerns.  See how pirate attacks have increased \u00bb  Gen. David Petraeus, chief of U.S. Central Command, said Thursday that the Bainbridge would be getting backup shortly.  \"I can tell you, there are definitely going to be more ships in that area in the next 24 or 48 hours, because there are two more sailing to it right now,\" he said.  \"Needless to say, we want to ensure we have all the capacity that may be needed over the course of the coming days.\"  Vice Adm. William E. Gortney, commander of U.S. Naval Forces Central Command, told CNN's Barbara Starr in Bahrain that, \"We have been moving forces in that direction.\"  White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said President Obama had been staying apprised of the situation.  \"Obviously, his main concern is for the safety of the captain and the rest of the crew on the ship, and he will continue to receive those updates,\" he said.  Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said an international coalition of countries is working to address the piracy threat, but the area in question is immense.  \"I think the ocean area we're referring to is three times the size of Texas,\" she told reporters. iReport.com: 'Stop the pirates, Obama!'  Referring to continuing problems with piracy in those waters, she said instability in Somalia has contributed to the flourishing of \"an old scourge.\"  The Alabama was loaded with food aid when the pirates hijacked it Wednesday, 350 miles off Somalia's coast -- a distance that used to be considered safe from pirate attacks.  It was the first time in recent history that pirates targeted an American ship.  Watch how pirates work off Somalia \u00bb  The pirates were armed with AK-47 assault rifles while the ship's crew carried no weapons, according to Ken Quinn, the second officer of the ship.  Crew members managed to take one of the four pirates hostage, Quinn said. The crew -- apparently minus the captain -- locked themselves in the compartment that contains the ship's steering gear, where they remained for about 12 hours with their captive, whom Quinn said they had tied up.  Watch Quinn describe the hijacking to CNN \u00bb  The pirates reneged on their agreement to exchange Phillips for one pirate whom the crew had captured. The pirate was released unharmed, according to Quinn, who spoke to CNN on Wednesday via a satellite call.  The pirates had scuttled the small boat they used to reach the ship, Quinn said, so Phillips offered them the Alabama's 28-foot lifeboat and some money.  \"We returned him, but they didn't return the captain,\" Quinn said.  The U.S. Navy issued a warning several days ago to ships in the area that pirates were operating farther offshore.  Watch former Navy captain discuss options \u00bb  There are emergency rations to last 10 days on the lifeboat, but the conditions are most likely \"uncomfortable,\" according to Murphy.  \"There's no toilet facilities or anything like that,\" he said. \"The captain has a VHF radio, and I'm sure that he's in voice communication with the ship itself. The problem is, of course, that... the [radio's] battery is going to die, and I'm not really sure how they're going to continue communication after that.\" iReport.com: How should the U.S. respond?  It is common for crews of merchant vessels to travel through the area unarmed despite the risk of pirate attacks, experts said. An armed crew could provoke a firefight that would endanger the crew's lives or its cargo, which often contains flammable or explosive material.  John Reinhart, chief executive and president of Maersk Line Ltd., said the crew can try to outrun the pirate boats or turn fire hoses on anyone trying to board the ship, \"but we do not carry arms.\"  Watch company spokesman say how captain is held \u00bb  The vessel was carrying relief supplies for USAID, the U.N. World Food Program and the Christian charities WorldVision and Catholic Relief Services. The U.N. agency said its portion of the cargo included nearly 4,100 metric tons of corn-soya blend bound for Somalia and Uganda, and another 990 metric tons of vegetable oil for refugees in Kenya.

{"article": "A new company in Germany is trying to break into the fashion business selling stylish clothes designed and produced by prison inmates.  Inmates design and produce the Haeftling range.  The company Haeftling, which in English means inmate, has just opened its first store in Berlin. \"We want to have basic, durable, timeless, beautiful clothes,\" said Stephan Bohle, one of the company founders.  Many of the clothes, cooking aprons and even stainless steel food trays offered in the Berlin store were either designed or manufactured in jails, but not just German ones.  One design shows a female comic figure that was drawn by a man sitting on death row in Texas.  Bohle said part of the proceeds from sales go to organizations that support prisoners' rights and better conditions for inmates, like Amnesty International.  But in some cases, money goes directly to the inmates that designed certain pieces. \"In the case of the female cartoon figure, this man was almost granted a stay from execution because of the design he did for us but in the end unfortunately the appeals court ruled against him,\" Bohle said  The clothes offered at the Haeftling shop also tell the story of the inmates that designed individual pieces. A small text inside the item lays out the prisoners story, including the name, where he is in jail and how long the term will be.  Some of the clothes are manufactured at a corrections facility in Halle, near Leipzig, in Eastern Germany.

It isn't something I want to be parading around.\"  But others seem to be catching the fever. Bohle said the company wants to start selling in the United States.  \"We've had people from New York, Chicago and Los Angeles ask about Haeftling,\" he said in an interview in the flagship store in Berlin.

Lobo, who took office in late January, was elected under a de facto government that resulted from a coup in June against then-president Manuel Zelaya. The ousted leader was then forced out of the country.

{"article": " -- The great paddlewheel turned the Ohio River water to a froth as the Delta Queen steamboat, a floating National Historic Landmark, departed Cincinnati, Ohio, on its final scheduled voyage this week.  The Delta Queen is the last running steam-driven, paddlewheeled overnight passenger boat.  The boat is a throwback to the 1800s and the era of Mark Twain, when thousands of steam-driven paddlewheelers plied the Mississippi River system.  The Delta Queen is the last of those operating as overnight passenger boats on U.S. waterways, giving riders a 19th-century experience on cruises complete with the carnival-like sounds of the steam-whistle calliope.  But it will dock permanently if Congress doesn't grant a safety exemption.  It left Cincinnati on Tuesday on a 10-day cruise down the Ohio and Mississippi rivers to Memphis, Tennessee, where it will unload what could be its final passengers.  \"There are so few really authentic things left. Everything is a re-creation or a tied up old dusty museum,\" said Vicki Webster, leader of the grassroots Save the Delta Queen Campaign. \"The Delta Queen is a breathing part of history and we have to keep as many of those as we can.\"  The frequent riders and steamboat aficionados are being punished, Webster insists.  Sherrin Kraus, 66, admires the Delta Queen as it passes by her home in Hanover, Indiana, each year.  \"I've been in love with this boat since I was 5 years old,\" Kraus told CNN affiliate WLWT-TV when the ship arrived in Cincinnati. iReport.com: Share your photos, videos and memories of the Delta Queen  Kraus and her husband Ken boarded the Delta Queen's possible final voyage to celebrate their 45th anniversary. They told WLWT they decided to celebrate the occasion early out of concern the ship would not get another exemption.  \"This was our 45th anniversary trip because we don't know what the future's going to bring, but we're worried,\" Kraus said. \"If she doesn't survive this last onslaught, it's the end of an era.\"  The Delta Queen will go out of service if Congress does not grant the ship another exemption from a 1960s federal law, the Safety at Seas Act, which bans boats made largely out of wood because of fire hazards.  The current exemption, which expires at the end of October, has been given to the ship nine times over 40 years.  See the Delta Queen's life in photos \u00bb  Supporters of the boat, which has roamed the nation's waterways since 1927 and helped the Navy ferry survivors of the attack on Pearl Harbor to San Francisco hospitals in 1941, are hopeful the ship will not play its famed calliope for the last time.  iReport.com: Watch the ship depart as a calliope concert plays  The grassroots campaign is gaining traction and the support of high ranking politicians. House Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, said in a statement he would work with Rep. Steve Chabot, R-Ohio, to try to get an exemption granted if the House returns for a lame duck session to address economic issues following the election.  Supporters, including several mayors, agree with Webster that granting an exemption to the Delta Queen would be a way to help stimulate the economy without it costing taxpayers a dime.  Lee Powell, director of the Mississippi Delta Grassroots Caucus said the boat provides economic opportunities.  By docking and unloading nearly 200 passengers up to a dozen times a year,  the Delta Queen helps to pump money into small cities along the heartland's rivers that are not normally tourist destinations.  Helena, Arkansas, which Mark Twain wrote in Life on the Mississippi \"occupies one of the prettiest situations on the river,\" could suffer if the boat ceases operation.  \"There are places in Helena that are essentially at virtually the levels of a third world country,\" Powell said. \"They were impoverished before and now with the economic suffering, to choke off one of the good things they have is ridiculous.\"  The fight ahead is not uncharted territory for the Delta Queen, which fought down to the wire in 1970 to be given the exemption.  Rep. James Oberstar, a Minnesota Democrat who heads up the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, has refused to support the exemption, claiming the boat, with a steel hull but largely wooden superstructure, is a fire hazard.  Webster, who says she is \"seething with anger\" about the complaint, said the ship is outfitted with state-of-the-art fire safety equipment and a full fire crew on board.  \"The heat detectors are so sensitive in the rooms if you take a shower and forget to close your bathroom door, the heat detectors go off,\" Webster said. \"It's ridiculous. You literally could not have a fire on the boat because it would be put out in seconds.\"  Webster says the fight with Oberstar amounts to a labor dispute and that Oberstar is bowing to the Seafarers International Union which represented the boat's employees before it was bought by Majestic America Line. Oberstar and the union have both denied those accusations, but Webster insists simple politics are getting in the way of saving a national treasure.  \"They're holding her hostage,\" Webster said. \"That's like punishing a child because his parents are bickering or tearing down the Statute of Liberty because of a dispute between the owners of the land and the snack shop.\"", "Q": ["Q: What should it be exempt from?

{"article": " -- A sheriff's deputy who killed six young people at a house party in Crandon, Wisconsin, apparently died after shooting himself three times in the head with a.40-caliber pistol, the state attorney general said.  Tyler Peterson, a sheriff's deputy, shot and killed six people, police said.  Initial reports that 20-year-old Tyler Peterson was killed by a police sniper's bullet were apparently incorrect, though it appears the sniper may have shot Peterson in the arm, Attorney General J.B. Van Hollen said.  Although the final forensic determination could take several weeks, the attorney general said that Peterson had his personal.40-caliber Glock when police found him. The three gunshots to the head came from a.40-caliber.  \"The three gunshot wounds to the head included two nonfatal rounds with entry points below the chin, and one fatal shot that entered Peterson through the right side of the head,\" Van Hollen said.  \"Each of the three head shots were fired while the gun was in contact with his skin, or extremely close to the skin,\" he said. \"These three head wounds are consistent with self-inflicted wounds, and not consistent with long-range rifle fire.\"  The fourth gunshot wound, Van Hollen said, struck Peterson in the left bicep and appeared to have been fired from a rifle \"at some distance.\"  Watch Van Hollen explain the shootings \"will never make sense\" \u00bb  Peterson was a Forest County sheriff's deputy and a part-time officer with the Crandon Police Department.  According to Van Hollen, Peterson, while off-duty shortly before 3 a.m. Sunday, entered a house where the seven young men and women had gathered.  While there, Van Hollen said, Peterson apparently got into an argument with Jordanne Murray, accusing her of having a relationship with another person.  \"The argument got heated, and Murray demanded he leave,\" the attorney general said. \"Peterson left, and returned minutes later,\" breaking down the door and opening fire with an AR-15 rifle, of the type he was issued by the Forest County Sheriff's Department.  Police said Peterson fired about 30 rounds.  Fewer than 20 minutes later, a patrolling Crandon police officer, after hearing gunfire, reported it and went to the house to investigate, Van Hollen said.  The officer, Greg Carter, 21, reported seeing Peterson leave the house with a rifle. After momentarily losing sight of Peterson, Carter \"heard multiple rounds of gunfire\" and his windshield burst.  Peterson escaped. Van Hollen said that Peterson apparently \"drove aimlessly around the northern part of the state\" for several hours, calling in false reports to police to throw them off.  Peterson  ended up at a cabin in the town of Argonne shortly before 8 a.m. He told friends about the shootings, handed over the AR-15 and two other rifles and left the cabin. After meeting with family members, he returned to the cabin around 9:15 a.m.  Police arrived about 15 minutes later, Van Hollen said. Peterson was killed during a police shootout after police couldn't persuade him to surrender.  All seven victims were students or graduates of Crandon High School, from which Peterson also was a graduate.  In addition to Murray, the dead were identified as Aaron Smith, Bradley Schultz, Lindsey Stahl, Lianna Thomas and Katrina McCorkle.  The sole survivor, Charlie Neitzel, 21, \"played dead\" after Peterson shot him three times, Van Hollen said.  After Peterson shot him once, Neitzel begged him to stop. But Peterson fired again. Neitzel fell to the floor, was shot a third time and didn't move.  \"Playing dead until Peterson left, Neitzel survived,\" Van Hollen said. Neitzel was the last person shot.  Neitzel underwent surgery Tuesday and was in stable condition Tuesday night, a hospital employee said.  The families of the six slain young people asked that media leave them alone in their grief, Van Hollen told reporters.  But the families of the victims also wanted it known that they had met with Peterson's family.  \"They hold no animosity toward them,\" Van Hollen said, conveying the families' wishes that the Peterson family be allowed space and time to heal.

{"article": "GENEVA, Switzerland (CNN)  -- The Obama administration has been talking about \"pressing the reset button\" with Russia after relations \"crashed\" when Russia invaded Georgia last August.  Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton laugh about their \"reset' button.  When Secretary of State Hillary Clinton greeted Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Geneva on Friday before sitting down to their working dinner, she presented him a small green box with a ribbon. Inside was a red button with the Russian word \"peregruzka\" printed on it.  \"I would like to present you with a little gift that represents what President Obama and Vice President Biden and I have been saying and that is: 'We want to reset our relationship and so we will do it together.'\"  Clinton, laughing, added, \"We worked hard to get the right Russian word. Do you think we got it?\" she asked Lavrov.  \"You got it wrong,\" Lavrov said.\" Both diplomats laughed. \"It should be \"perezagruzka\" (the Russian word for reset,) Lavrov said. \"This says 'peregruzka,' which means 'overcharged.'\"  The question came up at the news conference afterward.  \"In a way, the word that's on the button turns out to be also true,\" Clinton said. \"We are resetting, and because we are resetting, the minister and I have an overload of work.\"  Asked by a Russian reporter whether he had pressed the button, Lavrov said that he and Clinton did, indeed.  \"It is big and red and I hope that Russia and the United States, and other countries will never press on another button which used to be associated with a destructive war,\" he said.  The \"overload,\" Clinton said, is a broad agenda of issues.  \"We are going to systematically go through each and every one of them,\" she added.  Clinton said the two sides will get to work on re-negotiating a follow-up to the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty and nonproliferation. On other issues like Afghanistan, the Middle East and Iran, Clinton said, \"We will work through them.\"  On issues where there is disagreement, Clinton said, \"We are keeping those on the list because, we think through closer cooperation and building trust in each other, we can even tackle some of those differences.\"  Lavrov agreed the burden of the agenda for the two countries is \"enormous,\" but added: \"I don't think either Hillary or I have any desire to be freed from any burden.\"  Clinton called the encounter \"a very productive meeting of the minds.\" She said both Lavrov and she are \"very practical-minded\" and will create a \"specific set of objectives and responsibilities\" to present to presidents Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev before the leaders' first face-to-face meeting in April at the G-20 meeting in London.  On the START treaty, she said Russia and the United States intend to have an agreement by the end of this year when the treaty expires and are \"going to get to work immediately\" on it.  Lavrov was asked about Russian intentions to install S-300 missiles in Iran. He said the decision \"will be made exclusively on the basis of law in accordance with Russian law, and will be under expert control, which is one of the strictest in the world and of course in accordance with international agreements.\" Lavrov said the weapons Russia provides to its partners are \"nondestabilizing, defensive weapons.\"  In an apparent reference to U.S. military supplies to Georgia, Lavrov said, \"We want our partners to act the same way and show restraint in military supplies to those countries where, including very recently, those weapons have been used very close to our borders.\"  Senior U.S. officials who briefed reporters afterward, however, said they had not read Georgia into the minister's comments.  They said the discussion ranged broadly over a number of areas and \"we now have a very substantive work agenda that they just outlined.\"  \"It would have been easier and in a first meeting almost natural to be much more general but in this case it was very focused and very productive in laying out steps,\" one official said.  On the proposed missile defense system the United States is considering installing in Poland and the Czech Republic, one official said, \"Minister Lavrov made it clear he had listened quite attentively to Secretary Clinton's comments about missile defense... and I think it's got them thinking.\"", "Q": ["Q: What did the \"reset\" button actually say?

{"article": "WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- One of the the country's most powerful unions stepped up its campaign for a hotly disputed labor bill Monday, holding a rally on the eve of the bill's formal introduction in Congress.  Workers rally in support of the Employee Free Choice act in Lafayette Square in Washington on Monday.  The legislation -- the Employee Free Choice Act -- would create an alternate process for bringing a union into a workplace.  It is supported by President Barack Obama and the Democratic congressional leadership, but is fiercely opposed by most congressional Republicans and corporate leaders, who fear it will saddle a sagging business community with new burdens at the worst possible time.  Business leaders \"believe in this old market-worshipping, privatizing, deregulating, trickle-down [policy] that took the greatest economy on the Earth and sent it staggering forward because of their greed and their selfishness,\" declared Service Employees International Union President Andy Stern.  \"Without the Employee Free Choice Act... the rich will get richer and the rest of us will fend for ourselves.\"  Sterns issued his warning as his 1.8 million-member union prepared for a daylong Capitol Hill lobbying blitz on behalf of the bill Tuesday.  Democrats and Republicans may disagree sharply over the merits of the legislation, but leaders on both sides of the aisle freely admit it has the potential to significantly reshape the balance of power between business and labor for the first time in years.  The controversial act would allow employees to signal support for unionizing by openly signing a card demanding it. If a majority signed, the company involved would have 90 days to negotiate union representation.  It would also stiffen federal laws barring employers from intimidating or firing workers who try to bring in a union.  The traditional option to vote by secret ballot would still be available. But critics say the measure -- dubbed the \"card check\" bill by its opponents -- would effectively eliminate union elections, removing a fundamental hard-earned right of workers and forcing some workers into unions they don't want to join.  Some corporate leaders have reacted angrily against the measure.  If a retailer has not gotten involved with fight over this bill, he \"should be shot,\" Bernie Marcus, co-founder and former CEO of The Home Depot, said during a conference call about the act last October. Retailers who don't speak out against it \"should be thrown out of their goddamn jobs.\"  \"This is how a civilization disappears,\" Marcus said. \"I'm sitting here as an elder statesman, and I'm watching this happen, and I don't believe it.\"  Dave Bego, a business owner in Indianapolis, Indiana, shares Marcus' concern.  Bego is the owner of EMS, which provides janitors to businesses around the country. The family-owned company has been under fire from the SEIU, which argues that EMS intimidates, harasses and violates the rights of workers wanting to unionize. It has made the company a target of repeated protests for about three years.  Bego said the claims are unfounded, and it's the union that has harassed him.  He said the union has sent his clients threatening letters for using his company, staged noisy protests, confronted employees, blocked building entrances and even released balloons in a client's building to disrupt business. But he told CNN his workers don't want a union because they make more in pay and benefits without having to pay SEIU's labor dues.  \"We have several hundred people working for us in Indianapolis [alone],\" Bego said. \"They've been after us for almost three years, and they've got only about 10 or 12 people interested in what they said. If our people really needed protecting, don't you think they'd be out in mass droves in the street with the union protesting EMS? Do you think we'd still be in business? I don't think so.\"  But union workers CNN talked to say workers at EMS are afraid to speak out because they might get fired, as Shaneka Brown said she was.  \"We're not the only ones,\" Brown said. \"There are millions of other janitors and millions and millions of other companies that are going through same\" kinds of things.  And that, says Stern, is why the Free Choice Act is so critical. The SEIU president claims the legislation merely provides employees who have been intimidated by their employers an opportunity to freely and openly support a union.  \"This is workers' choice,\" Stern said in February. \"They can have a secret ballot, or they can legally affirm by a majority of them signing cards.\"  Observers believe Stern's union has the muscle to push the legislation through the Democratically controlled Congress. The SEIU was the largest contributor to Democratic campaigns this election, pumping $85 million into campaigns and get-out-the-vote drives. The union said 2,000 members temporarily gave up their jobs to work for Obama's election.  Now \"we have a friend in the White House,\" Stern declared Monday. \"Thank God for Barack Obama.\"  CNN's Drew Griffin, Marcus Hooper and Kathleen Johnston contributed to this report.", "Q": ["Q: What did the home Depot ceo say?

{"article": " -- One 12-year-old Virginia boy was playing baseball when it happened.  Lightning strikes Las Vegas in 2006. Already this month 11 people have been killed by lightning in the U.S.  The same week, a 33-year-old man was struck while jogging in Texas, a 70-year-old California woman was hit while doing yard work and a Kentucky man, 44, fell victim while waiting under a tree for a ride.  They are among 11 people killed already this month by lightning strikes in the United States, according to the National Weather Service.  \"Lightning is very random in terms of fatalities,\" National Weather Service lightning safety expert John Jensensius told CNN. \"We normally see a good amount of lightning in June, but this is unusually high. There really is no good explanation of why that's the case.\"  Six of the 15 lightning-strike deaths in the U.S. so far this year occurred in California, Texas and Florida, with the rest scattered through the South, Midwest and West. No deaths have occurred in the Northeast so far, \"likely due to the cool, damp pattern we've seen in New England,\" Jensensius said. \"There have been less severe thunderstorms there.\"  Summer is the deadliest season for lightning strikes because of the frequency of thunderstorms and the fact that more people are outdoors. This week, the first official week of summer, marks \"Lightning Safety Awareness Week\" for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).  The agency's message is \"When Thunder Roars, Go Indoors.\" That's because all the people killed by lightning in the U.S. so far this year -- and the 28 killed in 2008 -- were outdoors. Taking shelter under trees offers little safety -- nearly one-third of the people killed by lightning last year were under a tree when they were hit.  More than 400 people in the U.S. are hit by lightning each year, according to the National Weather Service. Lightning, on average, kills more people than hurricanes and tornadoes combined (among all weather-related fatalities, only floods kill more). While not all injuries result in death, many victims are left with devastating and permanent disabilities.  You may remember that as a child you were told to count the seconds between a lightning flash and thunder to see how far away the lightning was. But by the time you calculate it, it may be too late. Sometimes thunder and lightning can happen simultaneously.  Despite its \"Sunshine State\" nickname, Florida receives more cloud-to-ground lightning than any other state in the country, according to data from NASA satellites.  But Florida does not receive the most lightning in the world. According to NASA research, that dubious honor goes to the Democratic Republic of Congo, with 158 strikes per square kilometer each year. Thunderstorms occur in Central Africa year-round.  Here are some commonly asked lightning questions:  How powerful is lightning?  According to the National Weather Service, \"each spark of lightning can reach over five miles in length, soar to temperatures of approximately 50,000 degrees Fahrenheit and contain 100 million electrical volts.\"  Can wearing rubber shoes protect you from lightning?  No. That's a myth, and there are lots of them out there. For facts on lightning safety, visit http://www.lightningsafety.noaa.gov/.", "Q": ["Q: What has killed 11 people this month?

{"article": "(AOL Autos) -- Since there have been cars, people have chosen their rides based on what their cars say about them. AOL Autos put a list of cars before automotive industry experts to capture their take on several popular cars.  Drivers of the dependable Camry know what's important in life, says expert.  Our panel consisted of Stephanie Brinley, senior manager at Auto Pacific; James Bell, editor and publisher of IntelliChoice and Jim Markwalder, veteran automotive consultant from Detroit. Rest assured, these experts did not pull any punches.  Toyota Prius: Green no matter its color  Brinley looked through the company's vast data on the Toyota Prius.  \"Buying a Prius shows the world that you love the environment and hate using fuel,\" said Brinley. \"Compared to the overall industry, Prius buyers are more often women, have fewer kids and more often have college educations.\"  Bell adds, \"New Prius buyers want to be part of the 'green' club.\"  \"Prius drivers like the video-game challenge of continuously trying to best your own fuel economy achievements,\" said Brinley. Markwalder opines: \"There's a good chance that if you come upon a line of slow moving traffic, a Prius driver will be at the front of the line, self-righteously driving under the speed limit on his or her way to save the world.\" We're just quoting here, folks.  Chevrolet Corvette: Performer for the mid-life crisis  The Chevy Corvette \"seems to be more often a reward car. Its buyers are older than the industry average, with 88 percent born before 1946, according to Auto Pacific data. Only 11 percent of Corvette owners are in Gen Y or Gen X.\" Bell adds: \"Sadly, the usual stereotype of the Corvette buyer as a 57-year old male deep in a mid-life crisis is proven.\"  Better car than its image suggests  Bell sees another side to the Corvette. \"It is the absolute greatest performance bargain on the planet,\" said Bell. \"It's an affordable giant-killer.\"  Markwalder adds, \"There have been 1.5 million Corvettes produced since 1953, and while plenty of old guys drive them, they are an engineering marvel that will run 180 mph or return 30+ mpg highway fuel economy.\"  Toyota Camry: A major transportation appliance  \"I think the Camry gets a bad rap for being the 'microwave oven' of the car industry,\" said Bell. \"It's boring, reliable, efficient, and common. But to many drivers, these words are exactly all they are looking for, making the Camry their own personal rock star. A Toyota Camry in the driveway tells everyone that you know what is important in life, and it's not your car.\"  Dodge Challenger: The transcendent pony car  The Dodge Challenger looks more like its original than the 2010 Ford Mustang or Chevrolet Camaro. According to Brinley, the Challenger appeals to Baby Boomers who like styling and power. But almost 30 percent of Challenger buyers are Gen X or Gen Y. Surprisingly, this beats out the Prius, a more forward-looking vehicle; only 18-percent of its buyers are Gen X or Y.  Auto Pacific's data shows that the Dodge Challenger is winning buyers too young to remember the original 1970-74 Challenger. \"All ages stop and stare at this car,\" said Bell. \"Especially when it's in Hemi Orange, from old-skool Hot Rodders to the Import Tuner crowd.\" This wide appeal makes pegging the Challenger owner more challenging.  Ford F-150: Working man's truck  According to Auto Pacific data, the driver of a Ford F-150 work truck (a plain, regular-cab model), is an employed man. Markwalder confirms with this: \"Basic Ford trucks, like the XLT, make a good tool for the guy who works hard for an honest living.\" Bell adds, \"We'll see fewer non-work trucks because using them for commuting has lost its shine.\"  Mercedes-Benz R-Class: A marketing mystery  \"With 2008 sales of only 7700 vehicles, we don't have enough information about buyers to provide a strong picture of why somebody drives an R-Class,\" said Brinley. \"The more expensive GL-Class and ML-Class SUVs each sold three times as many.\" Markwalder states, \"The R-Class has always been a contradiction, looking like a minivan but not delivering on functionality.\"  Bell quips, \"My experience tells me that its few buyers are attracted to its three-pointed star (badge appeal) or the large discounts because the R-Class hasn't sold well.\" The R-class, a \"tweener\" that is somewhat minivan, somewhat wagon and somewhat crossover, has few rivals. Only the Ford Flex and the new Toyota Venza seem to come close.  Experts' first thoughts  Bell on Chrysler Sebring Convertible: \"I hope it's a rental.\" Brinley adds, \"It's an old person's cars, with only four-percent of its buyers from Gen Y.\" Bell on the Honda Insight: \"They're members of the Prius Alternative Club for Honda lovers.\" Markwalder on Smart ForTwo: \"Experimenters with a sense of humor who would rather sprint away from a light than hold up traffic.\"", "Q": ["Q: What may be telling people about you?

{"article": " -- An immigration judge with the U.S. Justice Department has granted a stay to John Demjanjuk, the Nazi war crimes suspect who had been ordered deported to Germany, his lawyer said Friday.  John Demjanjuk appears in court in Jerusalem in 1987 on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity.  John Broadley said the stay was ordered after Judge Wayne Iskra in Arlington, Virginia, decided to reopen deportation proceedings.  \"In the four years since his deportation was ordered, his health has seriously deteriorated,\" Broadley told CNN in a telephone interview.  Broadley had argued that Sunday's plan to send Demjanjuk to Germany, which has issued an arrest warrant for him, and putting him through the rigors of a trial there would be tantamount to torture.  Demjanjuk -- a Ukrainian -- is accused of involvement during World War II in killings at a Nazi German death camp in Poland. He denies the allegations.  The retired auto worker celebrated his 89th birthday Friday with his wife at their home in Cleveland.  Broadley said Demjanjuk suffers from pre-leukemia, kidney problems, spinal problems and \"a couple of types of gout.\"  German authorities issued the warrant for Demjanjuk on March 10, accusing him of being an accessory to 29,000 counts of murder as a guard at the Sobibor death camp from March to September 1943.  Demjanjuk says he fought in the Soviet army and later was a prisoner of war held by the Germans.  Demjanjuk has been fighting charges of Nazi war crimes for well over two decades. He was extradited from the United States to Israel, where he was convicted in 1986 of being \"Ivan the Terrible,\" a guard at the notorious Treblinka extermination camp. The conviction was overturned by Israeli courts on appeal and he returned to the United States.  The United States filed new charges against him in 1999, again alleging that he had been a concentration camp guard.  A federal judge found in 2002 that Demjanjuk had been a guard at the Sobibor death camp, where a quarter of a million people were killed during World War II, and at two other concentration camps.  Prosecutors argued that Demjanjuk concealed his history when he came to the United States in 1952.  He was stripped of U.S. citizenship and has been awaiting deportation since 2005, despite fighting his case all the way to the Supreme Court.

{"article": "ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- The photograph is a jarring image that shows Nazi Party members, shovels in hand, digging up graves of American soldiers held as slaves by Nazi Germany during World War II.  Members of the Nazi Party are forced to dig up mass graves of U.S. soldiers while American GIs look on.  While the men dig up the site, U.S. soldiers investigating war crimes stand over them. Two crosses with helmets placed atop them -- the sign of a fallen soldier -- are visible. Two Germans are knee deep in mud. Another, with a handlebar mustache, has the look of a defeated man. The bodies of 22 American soldiers were found in at least seven graves, according to the photographer.  On the back of the photo is written, \"Nazi Party members digging up American bodies at Berga.\"   Berga an der Elster was a slave labor camp where 350 U.S. soldiers were beaten, starved, and forced to work in tunnels for the German government. The soldiers were singled out for \"looking like Jews\" or \"sounding like Jews,\" or dubbed as undesirables, according to survivors. More than 100 soldiers perished at the camp or on a forced death march.  It was on this day six decades ago, April 23, 1945, when most of the slave labor camp soldiers were liberated by advancing U.S. troops. The emaciated soldiers, many weighing just 80 pounds, had been forced by Nazi commanders to march more than 150 miles before their rescue.  Watch survivor break down in tears over liberation \u00bb  The new photograph was likely taken in May or June 1945 when U.S. war crimes investigators combed Berga. It was donated earlier this month to the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum by Jim Martin and his family, whose father, Elmore \"Bud\" Martin, is believed to have snapped the picture as part of the war crimes investigation team.  The photo and dozens of others sat for years in Jim Martin's closet. Some of the photos, including graphic images of American corpses, were placed on record at the National Archives years ago.  See shocking photos of the slave camp \u00bb  But the image of Nazi Party members digging up graves doesn't appear to be part of that collection. Martin said he was proud to hand over the photos.  \"People have to see these. This is something that's history and it belongs with something that's historical to tell that story. It doesn't belong in my closet.\"  \"To be honest, I'm kind of sorry I haven't done it sooner. We didn't realize what it was.\"  Elmore Martin, who won a Silver Star for his valor in capturing images during the war, was 28 when he shot the photographs. Before the war, he worked as a photographer for the St. Paul Dispatch and Pioneer Press. Martin's son said his dad, who died several years ago, struggled to keep a job when he returned home. \"I now see where it all started,\" he said.  What Elmore Martin and the war crimes soldiers seen in the photo couldn't have known that day was how the case would evolve.  The two Berga commanders -- Erwin Metz and his superior, Hauptmann Ludwig Merz -- were tried for war crimes and initially sentenced to die by hanging. But the U.S. government commuted their death sentences in 1948, and both men were eventually released in the 1950s. One other Berga commander, Lt. Willy Hack, was executed, but not by the United States. He died by hanging, justice carried out by the Soviets.  Jim Martin said his father would have been upset at the freeing of the Berga commanders after the atrocities he documented. \"He knew it happened and to see that these people were released would be pretty devastating.\"  Efraim Zuroff, who has spent nearly 30 years hunting Nazis responsible for the Holocaust, said the U.S. government commuted the sentences and freed hundreds of war criminals like those at Berga after the war, as the Cold War began to intensify.  \"They were more concerned about keeping out Communists than admitting victims of the Nazis,\" he said. \"The realities out there were very conducive of letting these people off the hook.\"  How should Americans feel six decades later that the government freed the Nazi commanders responsible for atrocities against U.S. soldiers?  \"We're supposed to feel very pissed off about that, to be perfectly honest, and that feeling is very justified,\" Zuroff said.  The German government has since made reparations to the soldiers held at Berga. Zuroff said now it's time for the U.S. government to do \"the right thing.\"  \"To apologize,\" he said.  The Army said it is trying to figure out the best way to honor the Berga soldiers. There are about 20 known survivors still living.  \"The U.S. Army honors the service and sacrifice of all veterans who have fought our nation's wars. The Army is working to identify the most dignified and personal way to honor the soldiers held at the Nazi slave camp, known as Berga,\" Army spokesman Lt. Col. Willie Harris said in a written statement.  The Army refused to answer further questions about the Berga case.  Listen in as an elderly man learns about his brother's death at the camp \u00bb  Survivors have long wanted to know why the sentences of the commanders were commuted. In a letter dated June 11, 1948, to an attorney whose nephew died at Berga, the U.S. War Department said the sentences of Metz and Merz were commuted because they were \"underlings.\"  The letter goes on to say that Metz \"though guilty of a generally cruel course of conduct toward prisoners was not directly responsible for the death of any prisoners, except one who was killed during the course of an attempt to escape.\" That soldier was Morton Goldstein.  Survivors say Goldstein tried to escape but was captured. They say Metz stood him against a wall, walked up to him and shot him, execution-style, through the head. As his body lay on the ground, guards riddled him with bullets, according to survivors.  The soldiers who survived were not called to testify at the war crimes trial against Metz and Merz, instead prosecutors relied on about a dozen soldiers' statements gathered through the course of the investigation. At the trial, Metz blamed any deaths at the camp on U.S. medics.  \"They bore the sole responsibility for the medical care,\" Metz told the court, according to the book \"Given Up for Dead,\" by Flint Whitlock, citing trial transcripts. \"I ask you: Who must bear the responsibility? The answer is obvious: The U.S. medics.\"  Those comments don't sit well with Berga survivors. \"He was terrible, absolutely terrible. He lied,\" said Tony Acevedo, a U.S. medic who catalogued the deaths in a diary at the camp. \"Everybody hated his guts.\"  \"Even the German guards were scared of him.\"  Flip through Acevedo's diary from the slave camp \u00bb  Berga survivors say they await any recognition from the Army that may come, especially after all these years.  Morton Brooks, 83, said he constantly thinks about the day he was liberated. He was rail thin and had walked by political prisoners shot in the head during the forced death march. In the final hours before his rescue, his attitude was, \"Let them kill us,\" he said.  \"I think all the time that I'm a survivor of this and I'm still around,\" said Brooks. \"To me, it just amazes me. I don't know how I got through.\"  Jim Martin said he's still trying to process his father's role as a forgotten American war hero, armed not with a gun, but a camera.  \"The worst part is I'm just finding it out,\" he said.", "Q": ["Q: Which anniversary does it mark?

{"article": " -- The Red River at Fargo, North Dakota, reached \"major flood stage\" early Wednesday as the National Guard and a small army of volunteers filled sandbags to keep the waters at bay.  \"Everybody is just focused on battling it once again, and they're doing it with smiles on their faces,\" said Staff Sgt. Amy Wieser Willson of the North Dakota National Guard.  The river rose to a record 40.8 feet at Fargo in 2009. As of about 7 a.m. Wednesday (8 a.m. ET), the river stood at 30.34 feet, 12 feet above the flood stage of 18 feet and past major flood stage. Floodwaters are forecast to peak at 38 feet this weekend.  Are you there? Send photos, video to CNN iReport  \"Major flood stage\" is a term the National Weather Service uses to describe flooding causing \"extensive inundation of structures and roads\" and possibly the \"significant evacuations of people and the transfer of property to higher elevations.\"  \"[It's] very stressful for a lot of people, especially after seeing how much damage and how long the flood fight went on last year,\" Willson said. About 300 people were helping on the sandbag lines as the community raced to fill 1 million of them.  See local coverage of the flooding  Torrey Callies spent a couple of days helping shield his Fargo neighborhood from the rising waters.  \"We're making some good headway here,\" he said at midday Wednesday, as volunteers finished a sandbag dike. The sandbag levee is meant to hold back what's known locally as Meadow Creek, which branches off from the rising Wild Rice River.  \"Everybody that lives here went through it last year, so everybody is well-schooled in how to do this,\" Callies said.  Still, \"there's not the sense of deathly emergency that there was last year,\" he said.  At least 150 volunteers -- most of them high school and college students -- helped in the neighborhood Tuesday, Callies said.  \"God bless 'em for showing up, because without volunteer help, we'd never get this done,\" said Callies, 44, who owns a collection agency with his brother. \"In my book, that's a pretty cool thing to do.\"  The mess it makes of back muscles and backyards is worth it, he said.  \"You want to keep your house dry, and that's the main thing,\" Callies said. \"The grass will grow back.\"  \"It's tough because it's awful work and it's hard on the back and it's stressful, but what do you do? You just suck it up and start throwing sandbags.\"  Last week, warm weather and rain melted snow south of Fargo and Moorhead, Minnesota, causing the Red River to swell. Upstream, snow and ice have yet to melt, pushing water back toward the two cities.  Meanwhile, along the Eastern Seaboard, utility crews made steady progress restoring electricity after a powerful nor'easter whipped the region over the weekend.  About 125,000 customers in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut remained without power early Wednesday.  \"We know how difficult this is for our customers, and we appreciate their patience,\" said John Miksad of Con Edison. \"With each reconnection, we focus on restoring the greatest numbers of customers possible.\"  The outages were due mostly to power lines downed by Saturday's hurricane-force winds, which knocked over trees and utility poles.

{"article": "NEW ORLEANS, Louisiana (CNN) -- As Hurricane Gustav neared Louisiana's coast Monday morning, forecasters warned that the storm could stall over Louisiana and northeast Texas for several days, which would \"exacerbate the threat of heavy rains and inland flooding.\"  Water from a canal in New Orleans, Louisiana, floods a road as Hurricane Gustav makes landfall Monday.  Southern Louisiana's barrier islands and coast reported hurricane force winds and heavy rains from Gustav, which was centered about 80 miles south of New Orleans and about 20 miles south-southeast of Port Fourchon, Louisiana, at 8 a.m. CT.  Power went out about 6 a.m. in the western part of downtown New Orleans and in the French Quarter 10 minutes later, CNN correspondents Chris Lawrence and Anderson Cooper reported.  The eye of Hurricane Gustav made landfall near Cocodrie, Louisiana, about 9:30 a.m. CT, the National Hurricane Center said.

{"article": " -- Ventures lead guitarist Bob Bogle, whose fretwork on such instrumental hits such as \"Walk -- Don't Run\" and \"Hawaii Five-O\" influenced countless bands, died Sunday in Vancouver, Washington.  Bob Bogle (second from left) co-founded the Ventures, the highly influential instrumental band.  He was 75.  The cause was non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, according to Don Wilson, who co-founded the Ventures with Bogle in the 1950s.  \"He had a special sound that nobody could ever re-create. He was totally unique as a guitar player,\" Wilson told CNNRadio.  Wilson and Bogle learned how to play guitar while working as construction workers in the 1950s in their native Tacoma, Washington. The pair formed the Ventures in 1958.  \"We had a lot of time on our hands after work, so we'd get together and play,\" Wilson recalled. \"A year and a half later, we had a number two hit called 'Walk -- Don't Run.' \" The group first heard the song on a Chet Atkins record.  Several other hits followed, including \"Perfidia,\" \"Walk Don't Run '64\" and \"Diamond Head.\" The group took the theme of the TV show \"Hawaii Five-O\" into the Top Ten in 1969 and later supplied background music for the series.  But the band, which played almost solely instrumentals, was perhaps more influential for its albums. Thirty-eight of the band's long-players hit Billboard's Top 200 chart, including albums that covered country songs, dance tunes and Christmas melodies. One of the band's albums was titled \"Play Guitar with the Ventures,\" and countless did.  \"I can't think of a better contribution for instrumental music on his style than 'Walk -- Don't Run,' \" Wilson said. \"A lot of good would-be guitar players and garage bands would go out and buy guitars just to learn that song.\"  The Ventures were voted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2008. At the induction ceremony, Creedence Clearwater Revival's John Fogerty praised the group: \"It's enough to say, the Ventures are the most popular instrumental band of all time,\" he said.  Bogle fought his illness with dignity, Wilson said.  \"His doctors gave him 10 years to live, and he lived 12. The last two years were really tough.

{"article": "NAIROBI, Kenya (CNN) -- Two U.S. filmmakers were injured Saturday when their small plane crashed into a three-story residential building in downtown Nairobi.  People gather around the wreckage of a plane that struck a building in the Kenyan capital of Nairobi on Saturday.  Dan Parris, 25, and Rob Lehr, 26, both from St. Louis, Missouri, were shooting an independent documentary on poverty in Africa.  Both men were hospitalized and expected to survive, according to David Peterka, who was part of the film crew, but was not aboard the plane. He said that all four aboard the plane were Americans.  A flight engineer, whose name was not released, was critically injured and was in a coma, Peterka said. The pilot, whose name has not yet been released, was killed in the crash.  The crew had been in the east African nation for four days and was shooting video of Kibera, one of the largest slums in Africa.  The plane was headed to nearby Wilson Airport, where most light aircraft land in the Kenyan capital.  \"The pilot had warned that he was going to hover and go slow,\" Peterka said. \"They were surprised when they went to about 50 feet off the ground --- and then they hit electrical lines and the plane flipped into the building.\"  Just before the plane crashed, the listening devices went off and they could not communicate with the pilot, Peterka said.  Peterka said Lehr, who was ejected because the doors were open for filming, ran back in to rescue the others. Parris crawled out and Lehr, with the help of bystanders, pulled the pilot and the engineer out as the plane burst into flames, Peterka said.  \"Local residents were using water, dirt to put the fire out\" before the fire department arrived, Peterka said.  \"Before the plane crashed, witnesses said it was flying unusually low,\" said Francis Mwaka, a Kenyan federal communications official.

Hogan's lawyer said the quotes leaked to a gossip column have been taken out of context and the full article proves Hogan \"never condones the O.J. situation.\"  Watch Hogan claim he was misquoted \u00bb  A spokesman for Linda Hogan said the statement amounts to a death threat and that her attorney is \"weighing all options necessary to protect his client.\"  \"His violent and scary mood swings have been my nightmare for too many years,\" Linda Hogan said Thursday in a written statement. \"I hope for the sake of our kids that he gets the psychological help for himself and the safety of others.\"  Her spokesman, Gary Smith, said, \"For those who buy his claim the comment was taken out of context, read the rest of Rolling Stone and determine for yourself if his suicidal tendencies coupled with the use of drugs and alcohol make him a danger.\"  The controversial quote is part of a eight-page feature article about Hogan to be published in the magazine's Friday edition.  \"I could have turned everything into a crime scene like O.J., cutting everybody's throat,\" Hogan told Rolling Stone. \"You live half a mile from the 20,000-square-foot home you can't go to anymore, you're driving through downtown Clearwater [Florida] and see a 19-year-old boy driving your Escalade, and you know that a 19-year-old boy is sleeping in your bed, with your wife....  \"I totally understand O.J. I get it.\"  The controversy began with a leak of the quote to the New York Post's Page 6 gossip column.  Hogan lawyer David Houston said that quote was \"part of a larger conversation to exemplify degrees of emotional turmoil.\"  \"Earlier reports to the contrary exemplify the danger of cherry-picking quotes and reacting to them,\" Houston said.  Hogan spoke later Wednesday to a photographer with the gossip Web site TMZ:  \"I spent three days with a writer for Rolling Stone talking about being positive and happy and walking in the spirit of Christ. And he asked me, 'Well, why didn't you flip out?' Well, I didn't jump off the Empire State building, I didn't buy a white Bronco. I didn't do the O.J. Simpson thing. I took the high road.  \"I'm not focused on Linda anymore,\" Hogan said.  It has been widely reported that Linda Hogan, 49, is dating a younger man. She filed for divorce in 2007 after nearly 25 years of marriage.  Simpson was found not guilty of murder in the 1994 stabbing deaths of his wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ron Goldman, but was found liable for their deaths by a civil court jury.  Simpson later was found guilty in a Las Vegas, Nevada, armed robbery case and sentenced in December to up to 33 years in prison.  Linda Hogan's spokesman linked the comments to the 55-year-old Hogan's three-decade career, during which he held multiple championship titles and, during his heyday in the 1980s, was easily the most popular wrestler in the world.  \"We have always maintained that the fear that Linda has had to live with comes from the rage and instability much too often associated with pro wrestlers,\" Smith said in the statement.  Hulk Hogan's real name is Terry Bollea. His wife alternately goes by Linda Hogan and Linda Bollea.  CNN's Marc Balinsky contributed to this report.", "Q": ["Q: Who was Hulk Hogan married to?

{"article": " -- During a 1996 interview with television talk show host Charlie Rose, Apple co-founder Steve Jobs took exception to Rose's characterization of him as \"a guy who founds high-tech companies and tries to make another billion.\"  \"Yeah, well, I don't think of myself that way,\" Jobs said. \"The things that I have done in my life, I think the things we do now at Pixar [the animation company he bought in 1986], these are team sports. They are not something one person does.\"  If pop culture were a team sport, Jobs would have certainly played quarterback.  From the invention of iTunes, which completely changed the business of music, to offering the world its first completely full-length computer-generated animated film with Pixar's \"Toy Story\" in 1995, Jobs left his indelible fingerprints on the entertainment industry.  The other \"toys\" he helped create like the iPod, iPhone and iPad not only changed the way the world consumed media, but also inserted both Jobs and Apple firmly into the entertainment zeitgeist. Even the commercials, from the 1984, George Orwell-inspired Super Bowl Macintosh ad to the more recent \"Are you a Mac or a PC,\" were uber-cool.  While Jobs has been more well known and hailed for his innovation with high-tech, he also made some power moves which forever changed Hollywood. And in what sounds like a fantasy dreamed up by the geek gods, it all began with George Lucas.  As Jobs explained to the news program \"60 Minutes\" in 2003, when Lucas was creating \"Star Wars\" he reasoned that digital copy of his film would be clearer and cleaner than analog. The computer graphics division of his Lucasfilm company, which honed the technology behind the process, would go on to become Pixar Animation Studios after Jobs bought it for $10 million in 1986.  As chairman and chief executive officer of Pixar, Jobs led the way in marrying the endless possibilities of technology with the glitz and glamour of the entertainment industry.  The world hadn't even heard of computer-generated imagery (CGI) in 1991 when Pixar struck a deal with Walt Disney Studios to develop and distribute three full-length animated films. The first of these, \"Toy Story,\" captured audience's hearts with its tale of the adventures of a group of children's toys.  \"Toy Story\" went on to become the top-earning film of that year, grossing $192 million in domestic box office receipts and $362 million worldwide. It spurred two sequels, theme park attractions and an extensive line of merchandise.  It was followed by films like \"A Bug's Life,\" \"Monster's Inc.,\" \"Finding Nemo,\" and \"The Incredibles,\" the last two of which won Academy Awards for best animated feature. Jobs sold Pixar to Disney in 2006.  By then he was firmly back in the driver's seat as the chief executive officer of Apple, which was setting the world afire with its inventions.  One of his biggest launches was in 2003 with the iTunes Music Store, which revolutionized the world of music downloads.  \"Other companies sold digital music before Apple,\" said Bill Werde, editorial director of Billboard, said in a statement. \"Other companies made digital music available on computers and digital phones and used it in commercials. Apple's brilliance -- and I don't think anyone doubts that this was Steve Jobs' brilliance -- was that Apple made it exciting and simple and effortless and fun.\"  Jobs was a major influence on portable media, which paved the way for gamers to be able to engage in their favorite past time via handheld devices and film fans to be able to stream movies almost anywhere.  The introduction of the 99-cent single meant music lovers no longer had to purchase an entire album to selectively enjoy their favorite tunes. The ability of the iPod, and later the iPhone and iPad, to hold thousands of songs also meant that fans never had to be far from their tunes.  \"Thanks for allowing me to put my whole CD collection in my pocket,\" Sebastian Bach, ex-frontman of the heavy metal band Skid Row tweeted after news of Jobs' death was made public. \"You have made air travel a lot more fun among other things.\"  Innovation was not without some growing pains, however.  Some industry insiders worried that digital downloads were negatively affecting sales of music and the issue of piracy became a hot one. On Tuesday, Miramax chief executive officer Mike Lang in his keynote address at MIPCOM, a TV and entertainment event held in Cannes, France, pointed to digital monopolies like the one Apple has as potentially damaging to the industry.  \"Apple is the strongest company in the music industry because there was not enough competition, and still to this day there is not enough competition,\" Lang said. \"As an industry it can't then influence packaging, merchandising -- all the things that are vital.\"  Billboard's Werde also noted that \"Today, the music business has a complex relationship with Apple, which has become yet another entity that built an enormous business atop the rights of music companies, much like radio and MTV before it.\"  \"But I think you'd be hard-pressed to find one music executive worth his or her salt who wouldn't agree that Jobs' vision and tenacity blazed a trail for digital music as we know it today,\" Werde said. \"Without a doubt, when you think of the Mount Rushmore of the music business -- pioneers like Ahmet Ertegun and Jerry Wexler, Clive Davis and Jimmy Iovine - Steve Jobs has earned his prominent place.\"", "Q": ["Q: Who pioneered inventions?

{"article": "(WIRED) -- Hackers who commandeer your computer are bad enough. Now scientists worry that someday, they'll try to take over your brain.  Scientists can use brain signals to control computers -- hands free.  In the past year, researchers have developed technology that makes it possible to use thoughts to operate a computer, maneuver a wheelchair or even use Twitter -- all without lifting a finger. But as neural devices become more complicated, and go wireless, some scientists say the risks of \"brain hacking\" should be taken seriously.  \"Neural devices are innovating at an extremely rapid rate and hold tremendous promise for the future,\" said computer security expert Tadayoshi Kohno of the University of Washington.  \"But if we don't start paying attention to security, we're worried that we might find ourselves in five or 10 years saying we've made a big mistake.\"  Hackers tap into personal computers all the time. But what would happen if they focused their nefarious energy on neural devices, such as the deep-brain stimulators used to treat Parkinson's and depression, or electrode systems for controlling prosthetic limbs?  According to Kohno and his colleagues, who published their concerns July 1 in Neurosurgical Focus, most devices carry few security risks. But as neural engineering becomes more complex and more widespread, the potential for security breaches will mushroom.  \"It's very hard to design complex systems that don't have bugs,\" Kohno said. \"As these medical devices start to become more and more complicated, it gets easier and easier for people to overlook a bug that could become a very serious risk. It might border on science fiction today, but so did going to the moon 50 years ago.\"  Some might question why anyone would want to hack into someone else's brain, but the researchers say there's a precedent for using computers to cause neurological harm. In November 2007 and March 2008, malicious programmers vandalized epilepsy support Web sites by putting up flashing animations, which caused seizures in some photo-sensitive patients.  \"It happened on two separate occasions,\" said computer science graduate student Tamara Denning, a co-author on the paper. \"It's evidence that people will be malicious and try to compromise peoples' health using computers, especially if neural devices become more widespread.\"  In some cases, patients might even want to hack into their own neural device. Unlike devices to control prosthetic limbs, which still use wires, many deep brain stimulators already rely on wireless signals. Hacking into these devices could enable patients to \"self-prescribe\" elevated moods or pain relief by increasing the activity of the brain's reward centers.  Despite the risks, Kohno said, most new devices aren't created with security in mind. Neural engineers carefully consider the safety and reliability of new equipment, and neuroethicists focus on whether a new device fits ethical guidelines. But until now, few groups have considered how neural devices might be hijacked to perform unintended actions. This is the first time an academic paper has addressed the topic of \"neurosecurity,\" a term the group coined to describe their field.  \"The security and privacy issues somehow seem to slip by,\" Kohno said. \"I would not be surprised if most people working in this space have never thought about security.\"  Kevin Otto, a bioengineer who studies brain-machine interfaces at Purdue Universty, said he was initially skeptical of the research. \"When I first picked up the paper, I don't know if I agreed that it was an issue. But the paper gives a very compelling argument that this is important, and that this is the time to have neural engineers collaborate with security developers.\"  It's never too early to start thinking about security issues, said neural engineer Justin Williams of the University of Wisconsin, who was not involved in the research. But he stressed that the kinds of devices available today are not susceptible to attack, and that fear of future risks shouldn't impede progress in the field. \"These kinds of security issues have to proceed in lockstep with the technology,\" Williams said.  History provides plenty of examples of why it's important to think about security before it becomes a problem, Kohno said. Perhaps the best example is the Internet, which was originally conceived as a research project and didn't take security into account.  \"Because the Internet was not originally designed with security in mind,\" the researchers wrote, \"it is incredibly challenging -- if not impossible -- to retrofit the existing Internet infrastructure to meet all of today's security goals.\" Kohno and his colleagues hope to avoid such problems in the neural device world, by getting the community to discuss potential security problems before they become a reality.  \"The first thing is to ask ourselves is, 'Could there be a security and privacy problem?'\" Kohno said. \"Asking 'Is there a problem?' gets you 90 percent there, and that's the most important thing.\"  Subscribe to WIRED magazine for less than $1 an issue and get a FREE GIFT!

{"article": " -- North Korea on Thursday launched a scathing personal attack on U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, raising comparisons with previous colorful comments about the West by the communist regime.  Bush: \"A chicken soaked in the rain,\" according to a North Korean Cabinet newspaper.  At a meeting of southeast Asian nations in Phuket, Thailand, a North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman blasted Clinton for what he called a \"spate of vulgar remarks unbecoming for her position everywhere she went since she was sworn in,\" according to the state-run KCNA news agency.  The spokesman called Clinton \"by no means intelligent\" and a \"funny lady.\"  \"Sometimes she looks like a primary schoolgirl and sometimes a pensioner going shopping,\" the statement said.  In no particular order, here are some of the most outspoken comments of recent years:  In October 2001, North Korean newspaper Rodong Sinmun said U.S. President George W. Bush was \"an incompetent and rude president who is senseless and ignorant as he does not know even elementary diplomatic etiquette and lacks diplomatic ability.\"  In March 2002, after Bush bracketed the communist state of Kim Jong-il with Iran and pre-war Iraq as being part of an \"axis of evil,\" the North shot back and called the United States an \"empire of evil,\" KCNA reported.  In May 2005, North Korea described Bush as \"a hooligan bereft of any personality as a human being, to say nothing of stature as president of a country. He is a half-baked man in terms of morality and a philistine whom we can never deal with.\"  In December 2008 after an Iraqi reporter threw his shoes at Bush at a news conference in Baghdad the North's cabinet newspaper said in an article that Bush looked like \"a chicken soaked in the rain,\" according to Reuters.com.  In April 2004, a North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman described U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney as a \"mentally deranged person steeped in the inveterate enmity towards the system\" in the North.  In May 2003, the North said Cheney \"is hated as the most cruel monster and blood-thirsty beast as he has drenched various parts of the world in blood.\"  In May 2004, the North branded the Grand National Party of South Party a \"vegetable assembly\" and a \"modern brand Nazi party.\"  In November 2003, after U.S. Defense Secretary Rumsfeld described North Korea as an \"evil country\" and an \"evil regime,\" KCNA shot back, describing him as a \"political dwarf, human scum or hysteric. His hands are stained with the blood shed by so many people. He is, indeed, a human butcher and fascist tyrant who puts an ogre to shame.\"  In May 2005, after U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice described the North as an \"outpost of tyranny,\" a North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman described Rice as \"no more than an official of the most tyrannical dictatorial state in the world. Such woman bereft of any political logic is not the one to be dealt with by us.\"  In May 2009, North Korean newspapers said Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso was \"greedy for power\" and \"incompetent in politics.\" According to KCNA, they described him as \"nothing but a political charlatan who does not know where to stand, a mere puppet and a guy with a poor knowledge of history.\"", "Q": ["Q: Who did the Foreign Ministry describe as \"mentally deranged\"?

{"article": " -- Asashoryu stands at the pinnacle of sumo wrestling like a colossus.  Asashoryu is one of sumo's most successful, and most controversial, wrestlers.  But the 330-lbs Mongolian, sumo's most successful ever grand champion, has not been able to rise above the scandals and tragedies that have beset Japan's national sport in recent years.  Asashoryu, whose real name is Dolgorsuren Dagvadorj, grew up in Mongolia, where both his elder brothers and father were successful wrestlers.  Moving to Japan as a student he was spotted and trained by the Takesago stable and made his professional debut at the age of 18 in 1999.  Winning his first tournament, or basho, in 2002, his rise up the rankings culminated in him attaining the highest position of Grand Champion, or yokozuna, in January 2003, becoming only the 68th yokozuna in the sport's 2,000-year-old history.  Two years later, he set a new record by being the only man to win all six official tournaments in one year.  While Asashoryu's meteoric rise to the top was seen by many as reinvigorating a sport that had seen a decline in homegrown wrestlers and popularity, his success in the dohyo has not pleased everyone.  Some have complained that his wins are too routine, and purists grouse that he does not poses the quality of \"hinkaku,\" the dignity and calm expected in a yokozuna, or give the sport's traditions the necessary respect.  In 2003 he was disqualified from a bout for pulling on the top-knot of an opponent, and has gained a reputation as the enfant-terrible of sumo.  Regardless of the criticisms of Asashoryu's wrestling style, sumo's reputation as a noble sport of tradition has suffered from a number of scandals in recent years and exposed it as just as susceptible to the problems faced by other sports.  With deep links to Japanese culture going back to when sumo was part of the Shinto religious rituals, the sport's troubles have almost represented a national identity crisis.  Following the banning of three non-Japanese wrestlers for using recreational drugs in September, the sport's chairman and former-wrestler Kitanoumi resigned.  It came after a period of years in which a number of match-fixing allegations were made, some directly implicating Asashoryu, and plunging the sport into yet another crisis.  In January 2007 he was accused of bribing other wrestlers to lose bouts, compounding the view that corruption was prevalent in the sport.  Problems for Asashoryu continued in 2007 when he was suspended by the sumo wrestling federation for allegedly faking a doctor's note and was restricted from leaving his house in Tokyo, leading to reports of a nervous breakdown.  Mental as well as physical strength are necessary to reach the top of the sport, but while the punishing physical routine and \"hazing\" in the training stables has been known and accepted, tragedy struck earlier this year.  Takashi Saito, a 17-year-old sumo trainee, died in brutal circumstances, allegedly beaten to death by his stable-master and three fellow sumo wrestlers.  Continuing to make his mark in the dohyo will be Asashoryu's aim for the rest of the year, while sumo hopes it can recover its own poise.", "Q": ["Q: What level is the Mongolian?

{"article": " -- Manchester United's perfect start to the English Premier League season came to a halt on Saturday when the defending champions were held to a 1-1 draw at Stoke City.  United had won five matches in a row, and took the lead through a superb individual goal from midfielder Nani in the 27th minute as the Portugal international waltzed into the box and drilled in a low shot.  However, the industrious home side never gave up and claimed a point against the 19-time English champions for the first time in the Premier League thanks to a 52nd-minute header from big-money August signing Peter Crouch.  The lanky former Tottenham striker got between central defenders Phil Jones and Rio Ferdinand to nod home from a corner as United goalkeeper David De Gea was left helpless on his line.  United went into the match without England striker Wayne Rooney, who wrote on Twitter that he expects to return from injury for Tuesday's Champions League visit by Swiss side Basel.  His regular forward partner Javier Hernandez is a doubt for that match after coming off in the first half against Stoke having fallen hard on his head when he tumbled following a tussle with Jonathan Woodgate as the Mexican sought to score.  That left United with last season's top scorer Dimitar Berbatov up front alongside Michael Owen, who scored twice in midweek in the League Cup but failed to make the same impression.  Berbatov was similarly ineffectual and was later replaced by Danny Welbeck as United battled in vain to win the match.  The result left United on 16 points, above local rivals Manchester City only on goal difference.  City earlier briefly topped the table as second-half goals from substitutes Mario Balotelli and James Milner ended Everton's run of victories in their last four visits to Eastlands.  Balotelli broke the deadlock in the 68th minute after replacing Edin Dzeko, with his shot taking a deflection off Everton defender Phil Jagielka.  The Italian then set up David Silva, whose effort was ruled out for offside -- and the Spanish playmaker also earlier hit the woodwork.  Silva provided City's second with a minute to play as he sent England midfielder Milner clear after an error by Everton's former Real Madrid winger Royston Drenthe, who came on as a substitute.  Balotelli's return to form will give manager Roberto Mancini a selection dilemma ahead of Tuesday's Champions League trip to Bayern Munich.  Meanwhile, Fernando Torres was both hero and villain as third-placed Chelsea beat promoted Swansea 4-1.  The Spain striker scored his second goal in two games after a long drought to put the London side ahead on the half hour, but was sent off before halftime for a bad tackle on Mark Gower -- his first red card in the Premier League.  It was another mixed weekend for the $80 million former Liverpool player, who also netted in the 3-1 defeat at Manchester United before an extraordinary miss that saw him widely lampooned.  Ramires had already made it 2-0 before Torres departed, and the Brazil midfielder doubled his tally in the 76th minute before Swansea defender Ashley Williams headed in Gower's freekick.  Substitute Didier Drogba sealed victory deep into stoppage time to boost his hopes of starting in Wednesday's Champions League trip to Valencia.  Newcastle retained fourth place with a 3-1 victory over Blackburn, who remained in the relegation zone.  Senegal striker Demba Ba scored his first hat-trick in English football before being replaced by France midfielder Hatem Ben Arfa, who made his league comeback after almost a year out with a broken leg.  Fifth-placed Liverpool bounced back from the 4-0 trouncing at Tottenham by beating mid-table Wolverhampton 2-1 at home.  Charlie Adam was sent off last weekend but this time his 11th-minute shot produced an own-goal by defender Roger Johnson, and striker Luis Suarez made it 2-0 before halftime.  Substitute striker Steven Fletcher gave Wolves hope four minutes after the break, but Kenny Dalglish's team held on as England midfielder Steven Gerrard continued his comeback from long-term injury when he was introduced late in the match.  Tottenham closed to within a point of Liverpool, having played one fewer match, after a 2-1 win at Wigan.  New signing Emmanuel Adebayor set up Dutch midfielder Rafael Van der Vaart in just the third minute, then Gareth Bale headed home Luka Modric's 23rd-minute corner to make it 2-0.  Striker Mohamed Diame reduced the deficit five minutes after halftime but Wigan defender Steve Gohouri was sent off for a second booking for a foul on winger Bale as Spurs held on for a third successive victory.  Arsenal moved out of the relegation zone and up to 12th place with a 3-0 win over 10-man Bolton that left the visitors rock bottom after five successive defeats.  Robin van Persie's second-half double gave the Dutch forward 100 goals for the London club, while Alex Song curled home late on.  Bolton had defender David Wheater sent off with the score at 1-0 after tugging back England forward Theo Walcott, who later limped off.  West Brom and Fulham remained in the bottom four after a 0-0 draw at the Hawthorns which left the visiting London side still seeking a first victory this season.", "Q": ["Q: Who retains fourth place as Demba Ba scores hat-trick against Blackburn?

More than 150,000 allied troops, about half of them Americans, took part in D-Day on June 6, 1944, overwhelming German forces in an operation that proved a turning point in driving the Nazis out of France.  Allied forces secured the beaches at a cost of about 10,000 casualties in what was the first step in a campaign that would, in a matter of weeks, liberate Paris, which had been under Nazi occupation for more than four years.  Brown praised those who fought on that day, saying, \"as long as freedom lives, their deeds will never die.\"  He said their sacrifices had put obligations on people living today in what he called \"the great covenant of D-Day.  \"We must be as if liberators for our day and our generation too,\" he said, citing Burma (renamed Myanmar) and Zimbabwe, as well as the \"mortal threat of poverty, hunger, illiteracy, disease and want.\"  Obama addressed the 288 veterans said to be attending the ceremony, telling them: \"You are why we keep coming back.\"  Watch Obama deliver speech to veterans \u00bb  \"You remind us that in the end, human destiny is not determined by forces beyond our control. You remind us that our future is not shaped by mere chance or circumstance.  \"It has always been up to us,\" he said.  Watch Obama arrive in France \u00bb  He urged the world to remember what happened at nearby Omaha Beach, one of the main landing points for U.S. troops involved in the operation.  \"Friends and veterans, what we cannot forget -- what we must not forget -- is that D-Day was a time and a place where the bravery and selflessness of a few was able to change the course of an entire century.\"  Sarkozy described the horrors of the battle, where so many died before they were able to land that \"those who did make it ashore waded through the bodies of the dead and wounded that floated in on the tide.\"  He cited a letter from a U.S. soldier who said the day \"was like a waking nightmare. The ground was so strewn with bodies that you could practically cross the beach without touching the sand.\"  \"Never, never will France forget,\" he vowed.  The speeches were followed by a 21-gun salute, a lone trumpter playing taps and a flyover by American, British and French jets.  Among veterans attending Saturday's remembrance ceremonies will be 86-year-old former British soldier Jim Tuckwell, who said the events will help those present to remember fallen comrades lost in the heat of battle.  \"There was no time to mourn, you didn't have time to mourn,\" he said, recalling the events of 1944. Read Tuckwell's story  \"And the worst thing about later battles was that when you lost people, you normally had to bury them yourself. You couldn't leave the bodies on the ground, there was nowhere else to put them.\"", "Q": ["Q: Who are being paied tribute to ? A:", "Q: Which world leaders attended D-Day tribute?

{"article": " -- The United States believes that some members of Pakistan's spy service provided support for the deadly bombing last month of India's Embassy in Afghanistan, a U.S. counterterrorism official told CNN Friday.  The Indian Embassy in Kabul was badly damaged in the July 7 bombing.  Pakistan strongly denied the allegation Friday, but Afghanistan and India have previously accused Pakistan of involvement in the attack which killed 58 people including an Indian defense attache.  The official told CNN the evidence was not strong enough to draw a firm conclusion but there is a \"strong suspicion\" the Taliban was behind the attack, and that some unspecified aid came from Pakistan's Directorate of Inter-Services Intelligence, or ISI.  The official would not say how the intelligence was gathered, but he said the evidence was presented to senior Pakistani officials by a top CIA official, Deputy Director Stephen Kappes.  The New York Times, sourcing U.S. government officials, reported Friday that the United States intercepted communications between Pakistani intelligence officers and militants who carried out the attack in Kabul.  Pakistani Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas said the report \"unfounded and malicious\" and an \"effort to malign the ISI,\" -- Pakistan's Directorate of Inter-Services Intelligence. The bombing killed 58 people.  \"The ISI is a very disciplined organization, manned by military officials. It has played the most crucial role in the war on terror and apprehended members of al Qaeda, the Taliban, and those linked to the attack on mainland America on 9/11,\" Abbas said.  Abbas said \"despite our insistence, no evidence has been provided to us about these allegations.\"  Afghanistan claims Pakistan informally supports militants operating from havens in Pakistan's lawless tribal regions near the porous 1,500-mile border the two countries share.  Earlier this month, Afghan lawmakers directly accused Pakistan's ISI in connection with a string of attacks in Afghanistan. Among these were the Kabul strike and an assassination attempt on Afghan President Hamid Karzai at an April 27 military ceremony.  A senior Afghan government official said the charges were based on phone intercepts of conversations of plotters in Kabul with ISI officers in Pakistan.  A U.S. government official, who would not comment on the specifics of the New York Times story, said, \"We've long noted the troubling reports of a relationship between the ISI and the Taliban, and the incident at the Indian Embassy seems to fit the pattern of those reports.\"  India has previously blamed militants from Pakistan for the July 7 car bombing at the embassy.  Wajid Shamsul Hasan, Pakistan's high commissioner to Britain, and Hamid Gul, former head of the ISI, firmly denied the agency's involvement in the attack.  Watch Pakistan deny the allegations \u00bb  \"There seems to be a bit of sensationalism in this story,\" Hasan said. He said the government has regularly denied claims that ISI is involved with militants in Afghanistan and noted that Pakistan has been cooperating in the fight against terrorism.  Gul said the claims are \"preposterous\" and \"totally false,\" and cautioned that the CIA has been proven to be wrong about intelligence in the past.  The New York Times report also sourced the U.S. officials as saying \"there was new information showing that members of the Pakistani intelligence service were increasingly providing militants with details about the American campaign against them, in some cases allowing militants to avoid American missile strikes in Pakistan's tribal areas.\"  Pakistan and Afghanistan have a tumultuous past. During the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan in the 1980s, religious schools in Pakistan helped train fighters who battled the Soviets.  After the Taliban took over Afghanistan in 1996 and imposed fundamentalist rule, Pakistan was one of the few countries that recognized the regime diplomatically.  It dropped its support after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on Washington and New York.  Pakistan also has a troubled history with India, and in the past India has accused the ISI of supporting militant separatists in Indian-administered Kashmir, which has been the root of two wars between them.", "Q": ["Q: Who denies it spy agence helped plan bombing?

Elizabeth Taylor has used Twitter to share personal information.  \"It's very new and involves repairing my leaky valve using a clip device, without open heart surgery, so that my heart will function better,\" the famed actress wrote. \"Any prayers you happen to have lying around I would dearly appreciate. I'll let you know when it's all over. Love you, Elizabeth.\"  The 77-year-old Oscar winner did not go into further detail about her heart condition or the medical procedure.  She was briefly hospitalized this summer for \"scheduled testing,\" she said at the time.  She checked out \"sore, but intact,\" the actress said in an online message posted July 17.  Her publicist had denied tabloid rumors that her hospitalization was brought on by her grief over the sudden death of her close friend Michael Jackson in June.  Twitter is a social networking site that allows users to publish what they are doing using 140 characters or less. Taylor posts regularly on her account, DameElizabeth, which has more than 155,000 followers.  She opened the account this year at the suggestion of her close friend, author and actress Kathy Ireland, publicist Dick Guttman said.

Jobs died at 3 p.m. Wednesday at home in Palo Alto, California, said Amy Cornell of the Santa Clara County Public Health Department.  His death was announced Wednesday by Apple, the Silicon Valley company he founded with Steve Wozniak. Jobs was 56.  The hard-driving executive pioneered the concept of the personal computer and of navigating them by clicking onscreen images with a mouse.  In more recent years, he introduced the iPod portable music player, the iPhone and the iPad tablet -- all of which changed how digital content was consumed.

He had battled cancer for years, took a medical leave from Apple in January and stepped down as chief executive in August because he could \"no longer meet (his) duties and expectations.\"  On October 19, Apple employees will celebrate Jobs' life and contributions.  A company memo from Apple CEO Tim Cook said:  \"Like many of you, I have experienced the saddest days of my lifetime and shed many tears during the past week. But I've found some comfort in the extraordinary number of tributes and condolences from people all over the world who were touched by Steve and his genius.

{"article": " -- As Toyota recalls millions of cars, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reports that an average of 25 percent of U.S. consumers who get recall notices don't follow through and fix their vehicles.  The CNN Fact Check Desk wondered: Is there a way to ensure compliance with auto recalls?  Most vehicle recalls involve free fixes for the consumer.  \u2022 Clarence Ditlow with the Center for Auto Safety, a consumer watchdog group, says there is not a process to ensure that auto owners comply with recalls.  The center says vehicle insurers have an incentive and a method to reach car owners who haven't complied fully with recalls. \"Insurers have the VIN [vehicle identification numbers], and they could contact the insured drivers who have failed to comply,\" Ditlow says.  Because states are responsible for issuing a vehicle's registration, Ditlow sees an opportunity for state governments to force compliance. He says that states could refuse to renew registration until the manufacturer's fix has been made. However, he says, no states have taken this step so far.  \u2022 According to Edmunds.com, some states do require owners to make the requisite repairs before they attempt to sell the affected car.  \u2022 Jeanne Salvatore, with the Insurance Information Institute, says that auto insurers will pay damage claims caused by the current Toyota defects, then go after Toyota for reimbursements.  \u2022 CNN Personal Finance Editor Gerri Willis says that new car dealers are prevented from selling a defective car.  \u2022 If recall communications are deemed insufficient, the NHTSA can require further efforts from the manufacturer. But there is not a mechanism at the federal level to ensure that drivers comply.  \u2022 Bottom line: If the NHTSA's 25 percent noncompliance figure is any indication, there could be many affected Toyota models that do not get the requisite fix under the current recall. Although there have been suggestions for how to better enforce recalls, there is no mechanism in place to force drivers to make the change.

{"article": "During CNN's \"Going Green: Green Light for Business\" coverage, we've asked businesses to tell us how they balance the imperative for profit with environmental concerns. Jonathan Breeze, the CEO of Jet Republic, tells CNN how he's working to create a carbon neutral airline.  LONDON, England -- The aviation industry is often perceived as one of the bad guys in the climate change debate. As a mode of transport, flying is regarded as being particularly polluting because of the amount of fuel used at high altitude. And, it is estimated to be responsible for around 3.5 percent of global greenhouse emissions.  Jet Republic CEO Jonathan Breeze says it would be a mistake to let green initiatives in the airline industry fall by the wayside.  The sector's reputation was damaged further when it was excluded from the targets outlined in the Kyoto agreement, which was interpreted by some as an example of its disregard for the climate change issue.  This is unfair because the industry has taken great strides to reduce its environmental impact. For example, over the last 30 years, it has achieved a 60 percent improvement in fuel efficiency.  There is a great deal of research being undertaken by manufacturers into more efficient technologies and alternative fuels, while the Single European Sky initiative aims to improve flight planning across Europe to rationalize the amount of time an aircraft is in the sky.  Practically everything we do in our everyday lives has a carbon cost attached to it, but aviation is an element that we believe has come in for an undue level of criticism, when in fact it is arguably working harder than most industries to address the issue of climate change.  The reaction to this criticism from governments has been taxation. But making a special case of aviation fails to address the wider issues.  Aviation fuel is carbon taxed, but why is this tax not applied on other types of fuel such as electricity and gas? The additional revenue that would be generated could be ploughed back into green energy schemes and help deliver heightened efficiencies that our industry is already investigating.  Punitive taxation, which is driving up the cost of air travel, will ultimately end up being absorbed by the operator or by passengers. This, coupled with the current economic downturn, represents a significant threat to progress in the aviation industry as it could lead to a stifling of innovation and development.  Meeting the challenge of climate change costs money -- modernizing fleets with more efficient aircraft comes at a price. As an industry which has been hit hard by the downturn, some of these initiatives could fall by the wayside. To allow this to happen would be a grave mistake.  We identified climate change as one area where we wanted to set the standard in the industry, and as a new entrant to the market we have been able to build a commitment to carbon neutrality into the heart of our business operations. It was a consideration in our choice of the Learjet 60 XR as the model of aircraft in our 110 strong fleet.  The 60 XR is the most fuel-efficient midsize aircraft in the world, something it achieves by being built with light and strong modern materials, and flying higher and faster than other aircraft. It's a perfect example of a win-win solution. We burn less fuel; our customers enjoy lower pricing.  Aircraft positioning is another important consideration that has an impact on the amount of fuel consumed; our fleet is based all across Europe, to reflect where our clients are. The positions of our aircraft are carefully planned and managed so that the number of \"over flights\" -- that is legs where the aircraft is empty -- are kept to an absolute minimum.  We wanted to be 100 percent carbon neutral from launch so we partnered with ClimateCare, one of Europe's most experienced providers of carbon offsets, where each project is rigorously audited and monitored for quality. By comparison, under the European emissions trading scheme, which doesn't take effect until 2012, commercial airlines will only have to offset 15 percent of the carbon emissions they create.  With the impact of aviation on climate change being widely reported, people are more conscious than ever about their carbon footprint when using air travel.  While the overwhelming majority have not changed the amount they travel because of it, it is certainly becoming a more important consideration and people are asking more questions before traveling.  We have found that our attitude towards mitigating the effect our business has on the environment has actually become a business benefit.  Our competitive pricing structure includes a carbon offset charge, which is passed on, in its entirety, to ClimateCare.  By acknowledging our responsibilities in the area of climate control and putting tangible measures in place, we have received considerable positive feedback from clients and business partners.  We believe that Jet Republic is at the forefront of modern European business. If every company in Europe could run 100 percent carbon neutral, as Jet Republic does, the world would be a better place.", "Q": ["Q: what was chosen A:", "Q: what is the percentage of carbon emissions they do A:", "Q: What did airline choose?

{"article": " -- Ford is the only major U.S. carmaker that is getting by without U.S. taxpayer money.  Mark Fields of Ford says consumer confidence is key to getting the auto industry back on track.  GM and Chrysler, on the other hand, have been told the Obama administration they will receive operating funds for several weeks in return for undergoing significant restructuring.  Mark Fields, executive vice president of Ford, spoke to CNN's Kiran Chetry Tuesday on \"American Morning\" about the company's plans and whether it will be able to continue without financial aid from the government.  Kiran Chetry: So, Mark, your company is the one that's gotten by without federal money. Will you be able to continue that?  Mark Fields: Well, our position hasn't changed. We're in a different position than some of our competitors, and we're not seeking emergency taxpayer assistance.  Chetry: Right, but I'm saying in the future, how are you guys guaranteeing that you won't need to go to the federal government like your two competitors have and ask for some help?  Fields: Well, we're going to continue executing our plan, which really involves decisive actions around transforming the business, but also bringing great high-quality, fuel-efficient vehicles into the marketplace. And we've been working this plan over the last three years, and we've been making progress.  Clearly it's a tough time in the economy, but we are really focused on bringing these great cars and trucks to customers, getting our cost structure right. We've come to new agreements with our UAW partners. We're working through reducing our debt. So we're going to continue working through that, and we don't expect to take taxpayer assistance from the emergency funds.  Watch Fields discuss Ford's future \u00bb  Chetry: You say it's been tough times, and certainly for you guys, it has -- 2008 the worst annual loss in Ford's 105-year history. You guys can restructure. You can work out new deals with the unions. But in the end, if people aren't buying cars or they can't get credit, how do you remain viable?  Fields: Well, consumer confidence is the biggest issue in the marketplace right now. The good news is, our new cars and trucks that are coming into the marketplace are being well-received. Our retail market share has been up three of the last four months. We expect the month of March our retail share to be up again.  But getting that consumer confidence is really important. And that's why today we're announcing our Ford advantage plan, and it's for any customer who buys a Ford, Lincoln or Mercury product, when they come into the showroom and buy their product, if that customer loses their position, we will pay their car payments up to 12 months while they're unemployed, to give them that peace of mind.  Post your comments on AMfix  Chetry: You're also offering some zero percent financing. I'm sure that you're trying to do that as well because of the frozen credit in a lot of instances. I want to get your take on this, though.  President Obama announced yesterday he's giving... Chrysler a month, basically, to submit a reorganization plan that the administration finds acceptable. The Obama administration also of course forced General Motors CEO Rick Wagoner out. Was that the right move, in your opinion?  Fields: Well, what we are supportive of is that the president is committed to a vibrant U.S. auto industry. As we mentioned, Ford is in a different position. We're not asking for the emergency taxpayer assistance. But what we are focusing on is taking decisive action to streamline our business, but more importantly win new customers with the great set of products we're going -- we're coming out with over the next couple of months.  Chetry: You know, there is some unprecedented government intervention going on right now in the U.S. auto industry at your competitors. They're getting billions of dollars in taxpayer money. They're being forced to restructure, as we talked about. They actually were forced to fire their CEO. And right now, it seems that, you know, they're on a different level than you guys are. Is there some sense that perhaps there's an unfair advantage, that they're getting a lot of government help, whereas you guys are sort of on your own. Does that concern you?  Fields: Well, we don't feel we're being disadvantaged, because we have been restructuring our company over the past three years. We have been investing in high-quality, fuel-efficient vehicles over the last couple of years, which are just starting to come to the marketplace.

Lula da Silva was born to a peasant family in one of northeastern Brazil's most impoverished areas and migrated as a young man to a city near S\u00e3o Paulo, where he worked as a metalworker, losing his left pinky finger in the process.  In the 1970s, he became a union leader, said Luiz Valente, chairman of the department of Portuguese and Brazilian studies at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island.  During the years of military rule from 1964 until 1985, the government cracked down on unions. But Lula da Silva acquired a reputation as a public figure by leading a successful strike in S\u00e3o Paulo, Valente told CNN in a telephone interview.  \"He was able to negotiate a favorable contract for his union but, from a political standpoint, he demonstrated that worker strikes were possible again in Brazil,\" Valente said.  During the early 1980s, as the military rulers' grip on control loosened, Lula da Silva helped found the leftist Workers' Party.  In the late 1980s, he ran for Congress and won, but he chose not to run for re-election. Instead, he set his sights on the top job, waging a losing presidential campaign in 1989, the country's first presidential election since 1960. Successive tries in 1993 and 1997 were unsuccessful, but in 2001, he won and quickly surprised many observers.  \"When he began, he was perceived as someone very much on the left,\" said Valente. \"He was perceived as being a socialist. However, he has not governed as a socialist. Instead, his economic policies were a continuation of the previous administration's.\"  In fact, Brazil's economic policy has been \"pretty much middle of the road, some people would say pretty conservative,\" said Valente, who added that he has never voted for Lula da Silva.  But Lula da Silva has worked to help the country's poor, introducing populist measures intended to lower the incidence of poverty and making other moves, Valente said.  \"As a union leader during the military dictatorship, he learned how to negotiate with the so-called enemy,\" Valente said. \"So Lula is going to try to reach some kind of consensus, and he did. What he did was not a product of ideology but of a pragmatist attitude of the government of Brazil.\"  Lula da Silva's moderate modus operandi has gained him popularity at home, where he has made no moves toward abolishing the term limits that preclude his running for a third term next year, Valente said.  That pragmatism has served him well on the international front, where he is on good terms with the leftist governments of Venezuela, Bolivia and Ecuador as well as with the United States and the European Union. \"Lula knows how to play the game,\" Valente said.  Like Brazil's president, Rio did not succeed on its first try, having been rejected in an earlier bid -- which inspired planners to be meticulous, Valente said.  \"They were very well-prepared,\" he said.  Indeed, the city two years ago hosted the Pan-American Games, which officials looked on as a trial run for the Olympics, he said. \"Everything ran without a hitch,\" said Valente. \"It was just a beautiful event.\"  Lula's waterworks were no surprise to his countrymen, the professor said. \"He's a very emotional guy and Brazilians tend to be emotional. They're certainly not ashamed of showing their emotions... It's not unusual for Brazilian men to cry in situations like that. Brazilians actually like to see men cry. They think it's good to show your emotions.\"  Watch the reaction as Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, is named host city for the 2016 Olympics \u00bb  \"He always cries when he talks of his mother, who never saw him become president,\" said Fabiana Frayssinet, CNN's correspondent in Rio de Janeiro. \"He's a man who cries, who gets mad. He's an emotional man who says what he thinks whenever he wants.\"  Emotions were on display Friday on Copacabana beach in Rio, where thousands of people flocked on the first sunny day after two weeks of rain and atypically cold weather.  \"It was a mix of the end of a football championship with a... carnival and all the Brazilian festivals,\" Frayssinet said.", "Q": ["Q: what Rio's hosting the Pan-American Games was seen?

{"article": "BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- At least 33 people were killed and 20 wounded in a suicide car bombing targeting a national reconciliation conference in Baghdad, an Interior Ministry official told CNN.  Abu Ghraib attack victim in Yarmouk Hospital in Baghdad, Amjad Hameed  The attack -- which occurred outside the municipal building of Abu Ghraib in western Baghdad -- also wounded 46 others, the official said.  The attacker was targeting the latest effort by the government to foster national reconciliation between religious and ethnic groups.  Sunni Arab and Shiite tribal leaders were attending the meeting, backed by the Shiite-dominated Iraqi government.  Another Interior Ministry official told CNN the attack occurred when people gathered outside as the conference in the building ended.  Al-Baghdadiya TV said two of its journalists were killed in the explosion. An Iraqi journalists' group confirmed those deaths and said a number of journalists were also wounded.  Along with meeting attendees and journalists, Iraqi soldiers were among the casualties.  No one has claimed responsibility for the strike, but in the past, such gatherings have been targeted by al Qaeda in Iraq, the anti-American Sunni Arab militant group.  Staffan de Mistura, special representative of the U.N. secretary-general for Iraq, deplored the attack and passed along condolences to grieving families. He said the bombing targeted the tribal leaders after their meeting, and called the strike a \"horrible crime that is designed to sabotage reconciliatory efforts by the Iraqi people, who, I am confident, will continue on the road of dialogue.\"  The blast follows another huge attack on Sunday, when a man wearing an explosives-laden vest drove a motorcycle rigged with bombs into a group of police recruits in eastern Baghdad. That attack killed 30 people and wounded 61 others.  Most of the victims of Sunday's strike were police officers and recruits who had gathered outside a police academy on Palestine Street. The same academy was targeted on December 1 in a double bombing that killed 16 and wounded 46.  The violence came after Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki on Saturday rallied sheikhs of the nation's tribes to participate in Iraq's government.  It was the latest official effort to further reconciliation among Sunnis, Shiites and tribes of different sects and bring some former members of Saddam Hussein's Baath party into the political fold.  After the invasion, the U.S.-led coalition decided to purge Iraqi institutions of Baathists, most of whom were Sunni Arabs.  Al-Maliki, who is Shiite, has been criticized in the past by minority groups for not fairly representing Iraqi's ethnic groups.

{"article": "Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- Thirteen people were killed and 90 wounded in clashes between Coptic Christians and Muslims in Cairo, state-run Egyptian television reported Wednesday.  The clashes broke out Tuesday after Copts took to the streets to protest last week's burning of a church.  Earlier, Egypt's health minister, Dr. Ashraf Hatem, said the death toll was at nine. Coptic Church spokesman Father Abdelmaseeh Baseet reported six deaths previously Wednesday and said all the victims were Christians.  The Egyptian military has launched an investigation into the violence, said Mohamed Askar, armed services spokesman.  Those involved in \"the incitement of sectarian hatred or involved in the acts of violence\" will be held accountable \"to the full extent of the law,\" he said.  A feud between a Muslim and a Coptic family is said to have led to the church burning in Helwan province last week.  In recent weeks, tensions have been high between Egypt's Muslim majority and its Coptic minority.  A Coptic church in the town of Alexandria was bombed on New Year's Day, killing 23 people. The Palestinian Islamic Army, which has links to al Qaeda, claimed responsibility for what was the deadliest attack on Christians in Egypt in some time -- but far from the only one.  Ten days later, a gunman killed a Christian man and wounded five other Christians on a train in Egypt.  Also in January, a man was sentenced for his part in an attack on another Coptic church a year ago, Egypt's state-run Al Ahram newspaper reported.  About 9% of Egypt's 80 million residents are Coptic Christians. They base their theology on the teachings of the Apostle Mark, who introduced Christianity to Egypt, according to St. Takla Church in Alexandria, the capital of Coptic Christianity.  The religion split with other Christians in the fifth century over the definition of the divinity of Jesus Christ.", "Q": ["Q: Were the protests violent? A:", "Q: What was the cause of the deaths?

{"article": " -- It's amazing how a huge global phenomenon can begin.  Tetris, the simple puzzle video game, has been addicting players for 25 years.  In 1984, Russian mathematician Alexey Pajitnov was playing with one of his favorite puzzles when he had an inspiration: How about creating a computer version?  Pajitnov wrote the program in his spare time, simplifying the idea to make it easier for those of us who aren't math geniuses.  He used shapes made of four squares -- hence \"Tetris,\" which comes from the Greek word for four, \"Tetra.\"  In the game, players must position and stack blocky shapes to fill a grid without leaving spaces in between. Successfully completed sections disappear. The more sections the player completes without reaching the top, the higher the score. iReport: 25 years of Tetris  Steadily, the game worked its way around the world. Millions of people found themselves glued to their computers and game players -- hearts racing and screaming in frustration -- all over getting a simple horizontal line of digital squares to disappear.  \"I would just play it for hours and hours,\" said iReporter Joel Vetsch of New Haven, Connecticut, who got addicted to Tetris on a Game Boy when he was 10. \"I'm 29 now, and I still love it.\" See Vetsch's iReport here  Vetsch became so obsessed with Tetris that the game even showed up in his dreams.  \"I'd go to sleep and in my head I'd see blocks...going into each other,\" he told CNN. \"It was weird.\"  More than 125 million Tetris products have been sold, and Guinness World Records' 2009 Gamers' Edition book ranked Tetris No. 2 on its list of the top 50 console games of all time, behind Super Mario Kart.  Twenty-five years to the month after Tetris was born, CNN spoke with Pajitnov and Henk Rogers, CEO of Blue Planet Software, the company that manages the exclusive licensing rights to the game.  The two men talked about what makes Tetris so addictive, how they believe the game can help unite the world, and -- no joke -- why they want a Tetris competition in the Olympics.  See Josh Levs' interview with Pajitnov and Rogers \u00bb  CNN: Alexey, I want to start with you. When you first dreamed up this scenario all those years ago, did you ever imagine it would turn into a global phenomenon?  Alexey Pajitnov, Tetris creator: The very first time when my small game started working even without scoring or leveling, I couldn't stop playing. It's a really good game, but I [couldn't] imagine that it would be that big.  Henk Rogers, CEO of Blue Planet Software: When I first found it at the Consumer Electronics Show in 1988, I kept on coming back and playing more. And that was a for sure sign that this was going to be a good game.  CNN: There are stories of people going in to work on the weekends just to sit at their computer and play for hours. They even dream the Tetris shapes if they play for too long. Could one of you explain to me why it's so addictive and what goes on when you play it?  Pajitnov: First of all, it's a very simple game and it has a really strong creative spirit in it. So instead of destroying something, you kind of build up the profile out of those small pieces and enjoy doing it. And that's probably the very important addictive factor.  CNN: The simplicity and also the immediate satisfaction -- but then immediately it's time to work for the next one.  Pajitnov: Yes.  CNN: Henk, tell us some of the stunning statistics.  Rogers: Over 70 million products have been sold as a box product, and more recently on the mobile [market] we're almost reaching 80 million downloads worldwide. Last year 10 percent of all games on mobile phones in this country were Tetris.  CNN: We have some videos of takeoffs -- turning buildings into Tetris or human Tetris. Is that great publicity or are you concerned in a legal way, like, \"Stop grabbing our name and doing what you want with it?\"  Rogers: It's all flattery. I like it.  CNN: Alexey, you were originally unable to make a penny off of this for a long time. What happened there and how did it ultimately pay out for you?  Pajitnov: Back in the '80s when I designed the game, the situation with intellectual property was very unclear in Russia. Communism Party didn't inspire some individual kind of activity. That's why I decided I granted my rights for Tetris for 10 years to Soviet Union to my computer center. And I didn't receive anything from this 10 years. But 10 years naturally ended, and I'm fine now. (laughs)  CNN: You all put something into your news release: \"We have a vision of the future where people all over the world can meet and become friends without speaking the same language.\" You go on to say that people will be \"connected through the universal language\" of Tetris. Are you guys being sarcastic about that or is that an actual hope?  Rogers: No that's a real dream for us. Games are a universal language and Tetris breaks all culture, language and age and gender barriers.  CNN: Have you had complaints from people saying that Tetris is a drug, that it's more addictive, there should be some kind of warning with it?  Pajitnov: It happens to me all the time. People approach me and say, \"I spent so much of my college time on Tetris I almost blow my exams.\" And I usually ask, \"But was it good hours which you spent on Tetris?\" And everybody say, \"Yes it was really good hours.\" So I say, \"I not waste it, I gift it to you!\"  Rogers: I think that Tetris is the first virtual sport. And we'll see a Tetris Cup in the future and international competition. Hopefully we'll be part of the Olympics someday.  CNN: The actual Olympics? The Olympics Olympics?  Rogers: Sure, why limit the Olympics to physical sports? Why not mental sports?  CNN: Wow, that would open up a whole new realm. I know you have a lot of plans for building this. What will we see when we envision the future? Will there be 3-D Tetris? Or will I have goggles and play virtual Tetris?  Rogers: Tetris is the ultimate casual game, so we need to keep it simple. If 3-D takes it out of simple-to-understand games, then it probably won't go there.  CNN: You want to tell me how much you have made off Tetris over the years?  Rogers: A lot. (laughter)  CNN: Alexey, how about you?  Pajitnov: Yes, I am happy.  CNN: Enough to give Oprah a run for her money?  Pajitnov and Rogers: No, no. (laughter)  CNN: No, I don't think real people do that ever.  Have memories of Tetris? Send us iReports or join the discussions at Facebook or Twitter.", "Q": ["Q: Who is game's creator?

{"article": " -- U.S. President Barack Obama is expected on Monday to meet with the Shanghai mayor and hold a town hall-style meeting with \"future Chinese leaders\" before heading to Beijing to meet his host, Chinese President Hu Jintao.  Trade issues are likely to be a major discussion topic between the two leaders; the United States imports billions of dollars in Chinese products each year.  At local markets, Chinese government officials banned a popular Obama shirt over fears that it would offend their guest.  It depicts Obama wearing a Chinese Communist outfit made famous by Mao Zedong, the late Communist leader. The back has \"Oba-Mao\" printed on it.  Obama's visit comes as China relishes its spot as a key global player. It is involved in major international disputes such as the showdowns with Iran and North Korea and has used its position on the U.N. Security Council and its economic leverage to influence events around the globe.  China also is now the dominant regional player in northeast Asia, recently hosting a summit in Beijing with the Japanese and South Korean leaders.  The nation's economic expansion has led to a demand for raw materials around the world and the rapid expansion of China's presence in countries such as Guinea, Myanmar, Sudan and Venezuela. Human rights groups say China is propping up repressive regimes to secure its access to critically important raw materials.  China's rapid economic expansion outpaces growth in the United States, 8.9 percent in the past quarter versus 3.5 percent in the United States, giving Beijing huge economic leverage.  Obama's half-brother Mark Obama Ndesandjo lives in Shenzhen in southern China. Ndesandjo, an engineer by trade, moved from the United States after losing his job seven years ago.  Ndesandjo took the last name of the man his mother remarried and has dodged the media since Obama was elected president. He spoke to reporters about his semi-autobiographical book, \"Nairobi to Shenzhen,\" earlier this month.  He said their father was abusive and beat him and his mother. Ndesandjo owns a small chain of restaurants in Shenzhen and teaches piano to orphans.  The White House did not say whether the president would see him during his trip.  The final stop of his Asia trek is Seoul, where Obama will meet with South Korean President Lee Myung-bak and deliver a speech to American troops at Osan Air Base.  Obama is on an eight-day journey that has also taken him to Japan and Singapore, where he attended the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations economic forum.

{"article": " -- Of course the TV series Miami Vice seems dated now, but it's not just because Don Johnson's white Armani suits and slip-on shoes belong to a mercifully bygone era. The fact is, Miami is no longer the same city as the one portrayed in the 1980s cop show.  Party time in Little Havana.  The expansive sandy beaches are still there, as is the surfeit of sunshine, the hint of the exotic and the hordes of sun-hungry tourists who have flocked to this holiday hotspot for the last 80 years. But Miami has shed much of its unwanted baggage from the 80s and has grown beyond a resort town into something more substantial.  Still barely 100 years old, Miami was a tourist destination almost from its inception. The offshore sandbar called Miami Beach was quickly recognized as having all the ingredients of a world-class holiday resort and the hotel-building spree that took place in the 1920s and 30s has left Miami Beach with hundreds of stunning Art Deco structures that give the area its distinctive look  By the 1980s, as well as being the destination of choice for holiday makers, retirees and 'snowbirds' (Canadians and northern Americans wintering in Florida), Miami had attracted an uninvited guest -- the 'cocaine cowboy.' Miami's proximity to South America made it a key point of entry for Colombian cocaine smugglers and the city became a battleground for ruthless drug barons intent on grabbing their piece of the American Dream.  The mid 80s was the Miami Vice era, when the city's reputation for glamour and hedonism came with a side order of carjackings and gangland shootouts. But by the mid 90s, Miami had largely driven the cocaine cowboys out of town and hoteliers like Ian Schrager began converting some of those Art Deco classics into sophisticated boutique hotels fit for the international jet set. The guns may have gone but the glitz was never far away.  Now that Miami's been to rehab and come out cleaned up and healthy, it turns out there's more to the city than glitzy nightclubs and the surgically enhanced bodies of the beautiful people. Miami has acquired a reputation as the new kid on the block in the modern art scene, a reputation that was cemented when the world's most prestigious modern art fair, Art Basel, arrived in the city in 2002.  Just like the snowbirds, Art Basel returns to Miami each winter and the Wynwood neighborhood has now become a bona fide art district, with exclusive galleries showcasing cutting-edge art all year round. Nearby, the Design District is full of studios and workshops producing contemporary furniture and art.  Then there's the fact that Miami is one of the most cosmopolitan cities in the world, with some 60% of the population born outside the U.S. The food, music, culture and language of Latin America have all become part of modern Miami, giving the city a cultural heritage that belies its youth.  But don't think Miami's reinvention as a cultural destination has done anything to dent it's appetite for the good times. When it comes to partying, there's not many places that can keep up with Miami, and even fewer that can do it with as much style. In truth, there's still a touch of the old Vice about Miami, and who knows, with the 80s revival, we may not have seen the last of those white suits.", "Q": ["Q: What was Miami's reputation in the 80's?

{"article": " -- Judge Sonia Sotomayor knew she wanted to go into law from an early age.  Sonia Sotomayor says the nomination is the \"most humbling honor \" of her life.  As a child, she aspired to be like Nancy Drew, the detective in the popular children's mystery series. But at the age of 8, she was diagnosed with diabetes and told she would not be able to pursue that line of work.  Sotomayor said it was another fictional character that inspired her next choice.  \"I noticed that [defense attorney] Perry Mason was involved in a lot of the same kinds of investigative work that I had been fascinated with reading Nancy Drew, so I decided to become a lawyer,\" Sotomayor told the American Bar Association publication in 2000. \"Once I focused on becoming a lawyer, I never deviated from that goal.\"  See Sotomayor's life in photos \u00bb  Sotomayor's parents came to New York from Puerto Rico during World War II. Her father worked in a factory and didn't speak English.  She was born in the Bronx and grew up in a public housing project, not too far from the stadium of her favorite team -- the New York Yankees. Her father died when she was 9, leaving her mother to raise her and her younger brother on her own. Related: Sotomayor well known in sports  Her mother, whom Sotomayor describes as her biggest inspiration, worked six days a week to care for her and her younger brother, and instilled in them the value of an education.  Background on Sotomayor \u00bb  Sotomayor later graduated summa cum laude from Princeton University and went on to attend Yale law school, where she was editor of the Yale Law Journal.  In her three-decade career, she has worked at nearly every level of the judicial system, and on Tuesday she became President Obama's pick to replace retiring Justice David Souter on the Supreme Court.  Watch Sotomayor accept the nomination \u00bb  Sotomayor thanked Obama for \"the most humbling honor of my life.\"  \"I hope that as the Senate and American people learn more about me, they will see that I am an ordinary person who has been blessed with extraordinary opportunities and experiences. Today is one of those experiences,\" she said.  The 54-year-old judge, if confirmed, would become the first Hispanic to serve on the high court. She would also be the third female named to the Supreme Court, and the second on the current court.  See who's already on the Supreme Court \u00bb  Sotomayor is touted by supporters as a justice with bipartisan favor and historic appeal.  She currently serves as a judge on the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The liberal-leaning justice was named a district judge by President George H.W. Bush in 1992 and was elevated to her current seat by President Clinton.  Supporters say her appointment history, along with what they describe as her moderate-liberal views, will give her some bipartisan backing in the Senate.  Sotomayor presided over about 450 cases while on the district court. Prior to her judicial appointments, Sotomayor was a partner at a private law firm and spent time as an assistant district attorney prosecuting violent crimes.  Robin Kar, who clerked for Sotomayor from 1998 to 1999, described her as a \"warm, extraordinarily kind and caring person.\"  Watch Kar recall his work with Sotomayor \u00bb  \"She has an amazing story, but she's also just an amazing person,\" he said, adding that she has a knack for getting to know those around her. \"She was the judge who, in the courthouse for example, knew all of the doormen, knew the cafeteria workers, who knew the janitors -- she didn't just know all of the other judges and the politicians. She really went out of her way to get to know everyone and was well loved by everyone.\"  Conservatives argue Sotomayor has a \"hard-left record\" and believes that judges should consider experiences of women and minorities in their decision-making. They also described her as a \"bully\" who \"abuses lawyers.\"  Asked about allegations that she tends to be prickly with her colleagues, Kar said, \"I would say no to that. What I would say is that she has a reputation for being prickly on the bench, which is a bit different.\"  Kar said if attorneys have with a weak argument, \"she's very quick... and intellectually demanding.\"  \"They'll have a hard time if they show up in her court without really doing their homework,\" he said.  Margarita Rosa, a Princeton classmate of Sotomayor, said she's always known the high court nominee to be \"measured and methodical\" in her decision-making.  \"She really looks at the facts and she is, I think, very evenhanded and fair -- but does bring to the table a very valuable understanding of the challenges and experiences, I think, of average people,\" she said.  Obama has said he hopes confirmation hearings will be held in July, with the confirmation completed before Congress leaves for the summer.  Sotomayor was confirmed to her current seat by the Senate in 1998, a process that took more than a year. The final vote was 67-29.  Though a majority of Senate Republicans opposed her nomination, she did win several key Republican votes that year, which could prove critical in this year's confirmation fight.  In 1998, the New York judge won the support of 25 Republicans, including eight senators who still serve. If Sotomayor is able to maintain the support of just a few of those GOP senators this year, Senate Republicans would face an almost impossible task in defeating her nomination, even by filibuster, which requires 40 votes. Currently, Republicans hold 39 senate seats.  All 29 votes against her 1998 nomination were from Republicans, 11 of whom still serve.

{"article": "Editor's note: Nafees A. Syed, a junior at Harvard University majoring in government, is an editorial editor at The Harvard Crimson as well as a senior editor and columnist for the Harvard-MIT journal on Islam and society, Ascent. She is chairwoman of the Harvard Institute of Politics Policy Group on Racial Profiling.  Nafees Syed says President Obama's early words and actions send a powerful, positive signal to Muslims.  CAMBRIDGE, Massachusetts (CNN) -- President Obama has given the Muslim community around the world the message we have been waiting for.  He reassured Muslims in America that \"We are a nation of Christians and Muslims, Jews and Hindus -- and nonbelievers.\" For those like me who were critical of his standoffish attitude toward Islam during his campaign, this signaled a welcome change.  Even more important was his subsequent statement: \"To the Muslim world, we seek a new way forward, based on mutual interest and mutual respect.\"  In traveling throughout Western Europe in the past two years, I heard several anti-American comments; these Europeans were challenging me, a Muslim, about American foreign policy in Palestine, Iraq and Afghanistan.  In Muslim countries, I've heard admiring comments about how great it must be to live in a rich country like America, followed by accusations that, \"your President Bush doesn't like us Muslims.\"  As a Muslim-American, I have found myself in a difficult position. In America, I've had to explain Islam to other Americans, and abroad, I've had to explain America to those in the Muslim world.  Obama has done all Americans a favor by extending a hand of friendship to the Muslim world. For me personally, it has alleviated the pain of witnessing the country I love engage in a foreign policy that I could not approve of as a Muslim and as an American -- a foreign policy that created mutual distrust between Americans and Muslims. And Obama has followed up on his statements with actions.  In his first steps as president, Obama has initiated the closure of the Guantanamo Bay prison, called for the withdrawal of U.S. troops in Iraq and appointed former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, well-respected for his role in the Northern Ireland peace process, as special envoy for the Middle East.  For the past few weeks, I've heard overwhelming praise from Muslims for Obama's recent actions.  Obama has recognized a key fact that former President George W. Bush did not: Muslims in America and elsewhere are strongly affected by the situation of other Muslims in the world.  There is a popular saying of the Prophet Mohammed's that the Muslim community is like one body: If one part hurts, the entire body feels the pain. Muslims are very aware of this message and, in the last 20 years, three conflicts have continuously dominated the Muslim consciousness: Chechnya, Kashmir and, most notably, Palestine.  Obama recognized this when he chose his first interview as president to be with a reporter from Al-Arabiya, indicating he would actively engage Arab media. The Palestinian-Israeli issue dominated the interview, with Obama promising to work toward a solution involving both sides of the conflict.  To understand the challenge Obama faces in changing America's role in the conflict, one must realize the situation he walked into as president. Muslims around the world were watching the suffering of innocent Palestinian civilians in a Gaza military campaign conducted with a green light from the Bush administration. Obama is essentially trying to rebuild a relationship that has been destroyed.  However, Obama's tone of respect and not condescension, a clear break with the past, improves the chances that such a relationship could arise.  His interview with Al-Arabiya was filled with reassuring statements that America is \"ready to initiate a new partnership based on mutual respect and mutual interest,\" that \"the language we use has to be a language of respect.\" After years of hearing rhetoric of \"a crusade\" and \"Islamofascism\" from the U.S. government, Obama's policy of listening, not dictating, has generated optimism in the Muslim world.  I am sure that the Muslim world will respond with goodwill as well. Already, Obama is very well-respected there for his intelligence, eloquence and experience living in the largest Muslim country, Indonesia.  Muslims abroad are just as willing as those in America to taste his message of hope and change. To win over the skeptics abroad, Obama will just have to do what he is doing in America: reach out to all sides for solutions and follow up his words with concrete action.  In the meantime, the next few weeks will see Muslims around the world taking the hand America is extending after a long hiatus.

Beckham and Mathieu Flamini take part in an unusual goal celebration in the San Siro.  The legendary goalscorer has now put away nine in the last six matches but it was his combination with England international David Beckham which electrified the Milan fans.  Beckham, who had sat out the last two games because of a shoulder injury, set up Inzaghi for his opening two goals in the 13th and 37th minutes from a corner and a clever chip, both headed home.  After the interval, Inzaghi completed his hat-trick on the hour mark before Kaka added a penalty for the fourth.  Ivan Franceschini pulled one back for Torino in the 80th minute, but Massimo Ambrosini rounded off the Milan scoring in the final minute.  The win sees Milan level on points with Juventus but with a better goal difference. They trail leaders Inter by 10 points.

{"article": " -- BMW Oracle won the America's Cup as victory in Sunday's second race off Valencia against Swiss holders Alinghi gave them an unassailable 2-0 lead in the best-of-three series.  The syndicate, founded by software magnate Larry Ellison, is the first American team to win yachting's most prestigious trophy since 1992.  Ellison was on board as they clinched victory by a margin of five minutes and 26 seconds, underlining their superiority against Alinghi, who made a series of uncharacteristic errors in both races off the Spanish coast.  \"It's an absolutely awesome feeling. I couldn't be more proud,\" said the 65-year-old billionaire, who fought a lengthy legal battle to earn the right to challenge the Swiss syndicate.  The victory means the Golden Gate Yacht Club of San Francisco will now defend the America's Cup in the 34th staging of an event which dates back to 1851.  Oracle have held the technological edge in both races, with a radical 223ft (68 meters) wingspan on their catamaran.  Alinghi, who won the trophy with a 5-2 win over Team New Zealand in Valencia in 2007, dropped a possible protest after the second race as the result was confirmed.

{"article": "NEW YORK (CNN)  -- A rarely seen portrait of Michael Jackson is on display inside a Harlem luxury car dealership. Macky Dancy, a partner at Dancy-Power Automotive, said the oil painting titled \"The Book\" is believed to be the only portrait for which Jackson sat.  The oil painting titled \"The Book\" is on display at Dancy-Power Automotive in Harlem, New York.  A different portrait of the entertainer was among items auctioned from his Neverland Ranch in April. It is not clear whether Jackson sat for that painting.  The painting on display in Harlem belongs to Marty Abrams, a friend and customer of the owners of the high-profile dealership.  The 40-inch by 50-inch portrait, by Australian painter Brett Livingstone-Strong, sold for $2.1 million in 1990. Abrams acquired it as part of an unrelated business deal in 1992 and had it stored.  The painting shows Jackson sitting in Renaissance-era clothes and holding a book. Jackson sat for the portrait because he was a friend of Livingstone-Strong's.  The painting was unveiled at the Dancy-Power Automotive Group showroom on Thursday but was removed Friday because of crowd concerns. It returned to the showroom floor Monday morning.  Dancy said the painting's owner chose the showroom because it's near the Apollo Theater in Harlem, where the Jackson 5 won their first taste of fame by winning Amateur Night in 1967.  He said Abrams hopes the painting in some way can raise money for charities in the Harlem neighborhood. Dancy said Abrams is not necessarily interested in selling the portrait.  When news broke about the resurfacing of the painting, Dancy said, he received a phone call from representatives of Livingstone-Strong, the artist. Now, Dancy said, \"We are in the middle of possibly putting together the artist with the painting again.

{"article": "Hanford Nuclear Site, Washington (CNN) -- The federal government has set aside nearly $2 billion in stimulus funds to clean up Washington State's decommissioned Hanford nuclear site, once the center of the country's Cold War plutonium production.  That is more stimulus funding than some entire states have received, which has triggered a debate as to whether the money is being properly spent.  The facility sprawls across approximately 600 square miles of south-central Washington, an area roughly half the size of Rhode Island. It was built in the 1940s as part of the \"Manhattan Project\" to develop the first atomic weapon during World War II.  Millions of dollars and thousands of jobs poured into the remote area about 75 miles east of Yakima where nine nuclear reactors were eventually built.  During the Cold War, Hanford was a buzzing hive of activity, eventually becoming the main source of plutonium production for the nation's nuclear weapons program.  Decades of improper radioactive waste disposal earned Hanford the notorious distinction of being most contaminated nuclear site in the Western Hemisphere.  Today, the Hanford site is a virtual ghost town and those involved in the clean-up project say they will need every dollar of the federal stimulus funds.  There are still millions of gallons of untreated contaminated groundwater, hundreds of buildings used for plutonium enrichment that need to be torn down, and underground tanks that are full of radioactive sludge.  The stimulus money will reduce the clean-up time by years, according to Jon Peschong, who oversees the federal project at Hanford.  \"It was perfect work, ready to go for the stimulus package,\" Peschong said. \"Each day that passes the conditions worsen [and] the receipt of the federal stimulus money allows us to reduce the costs and also allows us to reduce the clean up footprint much sooner, years sooner.\"  The money is also created jobs for about 1,400 people at Hanford, including Joe Gill who manages a team that is tearing down equipment that is heavily contaminated by radiation. Despite the dangers of his job, Gill said it came just at the right time.  \"I had managed a production warehouse facility for one of the largest companies in the world, [I] thought I'd be there for 20 years,\" Gill said. \"We laid off 8,000 people in three months and they closed down our plant, [and] those jobs aren't jobs you just read the paper and get.\"  It is clear by watching Gill's team perform their time-consuming daily tasks that Hanford won't be decontanimated quickly. The workers have to suit up three to four times a day in protective gear. They break down contaminated equipment through a \"glove box,\" allowing them to disassemble the equipment a room away through lead-lined gloves. Each time a worker removes their hands from the gloves, they must be wanded down by a colleague checking for any radiation exposure.  The large scale of the project and years of cost overruns have led critics to complain that stimulus money is being misdirected at Hanford. A report by Sens. John McCain, R-Arizona, and Tom Coburn, R-Oklahoma, listed Hanford as one of 100 sites where stimulus money may have been wasted.  The Hanford clean-up \"has been plagued by massive cost and schedule problems - and almost no progress,\" according to the report.  Gerry Pollet, who runs a Hanford watchdog organization, says he supports using stimulus money to rid the nuclear site of its radioactive waste. But he questions whether the funds are going where they are most needed.  \"You are not seeing the value that we should be seeing for the clean-up and the environment,\" said Pollet, who heads Heart of America Northwest. \"They are picking the low-hanging fruit, the easy projects that give very nice photo opportunities. But that doesn't cost $2 billion.  \"Hanford is getting more money than many states in stimulus funds and you would expect to see real progress for clean-up [to] happen with those dollars.\"  While debate continues over whether and how stimulus dollars should be used, the Tri-Cities area that surrounds the Hanford site -- which includes Richland, Kennewick and Pasco -- is reaping the benefits of the clean-up boom.  Hanford began receiving stimulus dollars in March 2009, which helped the surrounding cities and towns avoid the catastrophe that has plagued other communities impacted by the recent economic downturn.  The Tri-Cities area has one of the lowest unemployment rates in Washington State, and the housing market has barely been affected by the recent economic downturn, according to the Tri-Cities Industrial Development council.  Ken Brutzman, who owns a local office furniture store, said his business was \"at a standstill\" last year before the orders from Hanford contractors started pouring in. Brutzman had to hire six temporary workers, two of which he may keep on full time, to deal with the boom in business.  \"We are on track to have best year ever,\" Brutzman said. His business has been in his family for three generations and will likely stay profitable for several more generations since the Hanford clean-up project is expected to take another 40 years.  \"It has my manufacturers raising their eyebrows saying, 'Wow how does that guy do that?'\"", "Q": ["Q: How much is being spent on the clean up?

{"article": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- New Haven, Connecticut, firefighter Frank Ricci, the lead plaintiff in perhaps the most controversial case involving Judge Sonia Sotomayor, said Thursday that Sotomayor's rejection of his reverse discrimination claim had undermined the concept of a merit-based civil service system.  New Haven firefighter Frank Ricci sued after the city threw out results of a 2003 firefighter promotion exam.  Ricci was one of a group of 20 mostly white firefighters who sued the city of New Haven after it threw out the results of a 2003 firefighter promotion exam because almost no minorities qualified for promotions.  The 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals, including Sotomayor, backed the city in the 2008 case Ricci v. DeStefano. The ruling of the Circuit Court was overturned in June by a 5-4 ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court.  The \"belief that citizens should be reduced to racial statistics is flawed,\" Ricci told the members of the Senate Judiciary Committee.  \"It only divides people who don't wish to be divided along racial lines. The very reason we have civil service rules is to root out politics, discrimination and nepotism. Our case demonstrates that these ills will exist if the rules of merit and the law are not followed.\"  Watch firefighters testify \u00bb  Ricci also criticized Sotomayor's 2nd Circuit for disposing of the case in an \"unsigned, unpublished summary order that consisted of a single paragraph.\"  Sotomayor was not present when Ricci spoke. She left the session after concluding her remarks earlier Thursday.  Sotomayor argued before committee members Tuesday that her ruling in the Ricci case was decided on the basis of \"a very thorough, 78-page decision by the district court\" and followed an established precedent.  \"This was not a quota case or (an) affirmative action case,\" she said. The case was a challenge to a firefighter test that had a wide range of difference between the pass and failure rate of different groups. The city of New Haven, she noted, was at risk of being sued by employees who could show they were \"disparately impacted\" by the test.  New Haven city officials, after a number of days of hearings, decided they wouldn't certify the test but would instead attempt to develop a test of equal value in measuring a candidate's qualifications without having a disparate impact, she said.  The question before the 2nd Circuit, Sotomayor said, was whether the city's decision was based on race or its understanding of what the law required it to do. The Circuit Court ruled that it was based on the latter.  Based on established legal precedent, the 2nd Circuit decided that the city's decision was proper under established law. The Supreme Court, however, applied a new standard, she said, based on a different area of law. If she were ruling on that case today, she said, she would be bound by the new standards set by the Supreme Court.  Ricci was one of several witnesses who testified both for and against Sotomayor.  Linda Chavez, head of the conservative Center for Equal Opportunity, which opposes affirmative action, argued that \"it is clear\" from Sotomayor's record \"that she has drunk deep from the well of identity politics.\" It is impossible for Sotomayor to be a fair judge when she has \"shown a willingness to let her policy preferences guide her,\" Chavez said.  Arkansas Attorney General Dustin McDaniel testified on Sotomayor's behalf, arguing that her opinion in the Ricci case was, in fact, an example of judicial restraint. It followed a string of legal precedents dating back almost three decades, he said.  New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg also testified in favor of Sotomayor, telling committee members that she is an \"independent jurist\" with a \"sharp and agile mind\" who would bring \"a wealth of unique experience\" to the high court.", "Q": ["Q: Who spoke in favor of the judge's confirmation?

{"article": " -- An Indiana judge Monday froze the assets of Marcus Schrenker, a suburban Indianapolis financial manager who authorities say tried to fake his own death by crashing his private plane into a Florida swamp.  Marcus Schrenker exited his small plane before it crashed, and investigators are looking for him, police say.  Investigators looking into his business dealings for possible securities violations requested the temporary restraining order in Hamilton County Superior Court, said Jim Gavin, spokesman for the Indiana Secretary of State.  He said the order, which also applies to Schrenker's wife, Michelle, and to his three companies, is aimed at protecting investors, and is related to a receivership filing. He didn't elaborate.  Heritage Wealth Management, Heritage Insurance Services and Icon Wealth Management are \"the subjects of an active investigation by the Indiana Securities Division,\" Gavin said. Public documents list Schrenker as president of Heritage Wealth Management in Fishers, Indiana.  A search warrant related to the inquiry was served December 31, Gavin said.  According to The Herald Bulletin in Anderson, Indiana, Michelle Schrenker filed for divorce in Hamilton Superior Court on December 30. A hearing was set for February 5.  Schrenker, 38, took off alone Sunday night in a corporate plane, a Piper PA-46, from Anderson, Indiana, en route to Destin, Florida. Authorities said the Fisher, Indiana, businessman parachuted to the ground before letting the plane crash in the Florida panhandle.  The craft came down near the Blackwater River, only 50 to 75 yards from homes, said Sgt. Scott Haines of the Santa Rosa County Sheriff's Office.  Watch more about the mysterious flight \u00bb  \"It is a neighborhood -- some very nice waterfront property,\" he said.  Military aircraft from Whiting Field, which were dispatched to intercept the plane after Schrenker reported an emergency, witnessed the crash about 9:15 p.m. CT. The crews fired flares and noticed the plane's door was open and the cockpit was dark, Haines said in a news release. They got no response.  Haines said the plane appeared to have been put on autopilot at around 2,000 feet, over the Birmingham, Alabama, area, before the pilot parachuted to the ground. Schrenker had contacted air traffic controllers, saying that the windshield imploded.  \"The pilot stated that he was bleeding profusely,\" the news release said. \"Radio contact with the plane was not able to be established after that point. When deputies located the plane at the crash site, no blood was present and the door to the plane was open.\"  The Childersburg, Alabama, Police Department reported that Schrenker approached one of its officers shortly before 2:30 a.m., \"and said that he had been in a canoeing accident with some friends,\" a news release said. Childersburg is about 35 miles southeast of Birmingham.  Childersburg officers, unaware of the plane crash, took Schrenker to a hotel in nearby Harpersville. After hearing about the crash, they went back to the hotel, where they found that Schrenker had checked into the hotel under a fictitious name.  \"When authorities entered Schrenker's room, he was not there,\" the release said.  Authorities said Schrenker checked in under a fake name, put on a black cap and fled into a wooded area.  Hotel manager Yogi Patel, who identified Schrenker on surveillance video, told CNN that Schrenker was the only guest overnight. He signed in as Jason Galouzs of Bolingbrook, Illinois, Patel said.  A hotel employee said Schrenker went up to his room, but didn't enter before leaving the building. iReport.com: Are you near the crash site? Tell us about it  Steve Darlington, manager of Anderson Municipal Airport, told CNN the plane was in fine condition at takeoff, and said Schrenker is \"an accomplished pilot\" who owns \"a couple of airplanes\" and flies regularly.  No agency has come forward to lead the probe.  \"The FBI is looking into the matter, along with other agencies,\" said Paul Draymond, of the Birmingham FBI office.  Kathleen Bergen, spokeswoman for the Federal Aviation Administration, said several factors indicated the pilot likely left the plane before the crash: a \"detailed review of radar data,\" the fact that the plane was switched to autopilot before it crashed, the sighting by military jet crews and the fact that the cockpit was found mostly intact with no one inside.  After the pilot alerted air traffic controllers about the alleged problems with his plane, authorities tried to persuade him to land in Pell City, Alabama, east of Birmingham, Haines said.  Schrenker also flew an acrobatic plane, and made a video featured on a YouTube site. A message preceding the video warns, \"No pilot should attempt this stunt. You will get yourself killed. Pilot specially trained to fly unlimited acrobatics and shows.\"  CNN's Josh Levs contributed to this report.", "Q": ["Q: What was the pilot trying to do?

{"article": "  -- Former U.S. President Bill Clinton landed in North Korea early Tuesday on a mission to negotiate the release of two American journalists imprisoned there since March, according to the country's state news agency and a CNN source.  Former U.S. President Bill Clinton is shown at an environmental summit in Seoul, South Korea, in May.  The North Korean news agency KCNA did not disclose the purpose of the visit in its three-line dispatch. But a source with detailed knowledge of the former president's movements told CNN late Monday that Clinton was going to seek the release of Laura Ling and Euna Lee, both reporters for California-based Current TV -- media venture launched by Clinton's former vice president, Al Gore.  Meeting Clinton were the vice president of North Korea's Supreme People's Assembly, Yang Hyong Sop, and Kim Kye Gwan, the vice foreign minister, KCNA reported, adding that \"a little girl presented a bouquet to Bill Clinton.\"  The women were arrested while reporting on the border between North Korea and China and sentenced in June to 12 years in prison on charges of entering the country illegally to conduct a smear campaign.  Since the United States has no diplomatic relations with North Korea, efforts to resolve the issue so far have been handled through Sweden, which represents U.S. interests in the reclusive communist state.  Watch what may lie behind the pick of Bill Clinton \u00bb  Last month, Clinton's wife -- U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton -- said the Obama administration had dropped its request for Ling and Lee to be released on humanitarian grounds and instead was seeking amnesty, which implies forgiveness for an offense.  This change in language is an important distinction that could move North Korea to release the women without feeling that its legal system has been slighted, according to analyst Mike Chinoy.  \"I suspect that it was made pretty clear in advance that Bill Clinton would be able to return with these two women otherwise it would be a terrible loss of face for him,\" said Chinoy, an Edgerton Senior Fellow on Asia at the Pacific Council on International Policy in Los Angeles. \"The bigger, broader and more important question is what else could be on the agenda. Will Clinton be carrying a letter from Barack Obama for the North Korean leader Kim Jong Il? Will he meet Kim Jong Il?\"  Clinton's mission comes as the United States and its allies in the region are trying to push North Korea back into stalled nuclear disarmament talks. North Korea conducted a nuclear bomb test, its second, in May, and has conducted several missile tests since then. The United Nations responded by tightening and expanding sanctions on the North.  The two nations were on opposite sides in the 1950-1953 Korean War and had no regular contacts before a 1994 crisis over North Korea's nuclear program. North Korea agreed at that time to halt the development of nuclear weapons, but abandoned that accord and withdrew from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 2003.  Clinton had considered visiting North Korea in 2000 near the end of his second term as president. His secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, had gone to Pyongyang in early 2000 to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Il -- now widely reported to be ill.

{"article": "JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (Reuters) -- His name is \"Average\" and the story of his desperate flight from the wreckage of President Robert Mugabe's Zimbabwe is an increasingly common one.  Math teacher Mawise Gumba fled Zimbabwe and found his qualifications mean little as a refugee.  The tall 34-year-old, slouching exhausted in a Johannesburg church that has become a de facto transit camp, is one man in a tide of migrants washing up in South Africa.  \"There is nothing for me there in our country any more. I had no job and I could not afford anything. Even when I was working life was tough,\" he said.  \"It's hard for everyone... I thought it was better for me here,\" said the former store clerk, whose dusty jeans and boots tell of a long and difficult journey.  The tale told by Average -- whose name is not unusual in Zimbabwe -- is depressingly familiar to a people who have watched their once prosperous land spiral into economic disaster.  When Mugabe's government, facing inflation of close to 5,000 percent, ordered companies to halve prices of basic goods and services a month ago -- effectively demanding that they operate at a loss -- Average lost his job as the supermarket chain he worked for cut staff.  Facing the prospect of homelessness and hunger in his own country, he joined the estimated 4,000 Zimbabweans who head south to South Africa, most of them illegally, every day.  Mugabe, 83 and in power since the country's independence from Britain in 1980, has been accused of running Zimbabwe's economy into the ground while implementing a draconian crackdown aimed at keeping power.  His decision to launch violent seizures of white-owned farms seven years ago is partly blamed for soaring unemployment and the highest inflation rate in the world.  Average scraped together his last salary, some money he made from trading sugar bought at a discount from the supermarket where he worked, and funds borrowed from friends to secure a visitor's visa and bus ticket to Johannesburg.  A friend who promised to meet him on arrival failed to show up, leaving him stranded without a place to sleep.  On Wednesday evening he walked into the Central Methodist Church in downtown Johannesburg and joined a long queue of people waiting for shelter and food.  The church's homeless shelter has become a virtual refugee camp for 800-900 Zimbabweans and a smaller number of migrants from other countries.  \"Over the past three years, and more so over the past couple of months, I have noted an exponential increase in the number of people we have from Zimbabwe,\" Bishop Paul Verryn said.  Outside his office the line of people waiting for help grew. Many of the new arrivals were asleep in their seats.  \"We offer them a place off the streets, where they are protected and have warmth from the inclement streets of Johannesburg,\" Verryn said.  At sunset the refugees crowd into the building and lay out reeking blankets.  \"People just sleep anywhere they can find a space to sleep. Some people sleep on the steps here, in the corridors and others in the foyer and in the meeting rooms,\" said 27-year-old Walter Rusike from Harare.  The commerce graduate and his wife and two children share a meeting room with other families and have been at the shelter for four months.  Average said he hoped to get accommodation for a few days until he finds his friend, work or both.  \"I have a diploma in stores management and store control, a certificate in security and a driver's licence. I think maybe I will be able to find some work with my qualifications. Anything will be better than the situation I was in,\" he says.  E-mail to a friend.", "Q": ["Q: Who fled the wreckage?

{"article": " -- The name of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie surfaced once again in the national news this week, floated by some as a possible new entrant in the ever-widening, fickle field of Republican presidential contenders.  But Christie got even more attention on his own by heading straight to the \"Jersey Shore\" -- the TV show.  On Monday, Christie vetoed a $420,000 tax break previously granted to MTV's most popular program -- the highly viewed and just as highly derided reality series featuring Snooki, The Situation and other often inebriated free-range narcissists. In denying the show's producers the New Jersey Economic Development Authority's 20% tax credit on TV shows filmed or produced in the state, Christie said it was unjustifiable \"for a project which does nothing more than perpetuate misconceptions about the state and its citizens.\"  Like a rain-slicked Atlantic City boardwalk as it snakes its way to the shore, that's some slippery ground on which Christie is treading.  It's difficult, maybe even impossible, to disagree with him on the position of being anti-\"Jersey Shore\": Anything that slows the spread of that video virus is, almost by definition, a good thing. But what if the same logic and political tactics had been used on, say, HBO's \"The Sopranos\"? Even if that sort of concern amounts to fiscal responsibility, it also amounts to artistic irresponsibility.  Politicians have attacked TV before, but the attention they draw rarely has them getting the last word, or being awarded the final victory. Dan Quayle vs. \"Murphy Brown\"? The CBS sitcom won that one, handily; the single mother about whom Quayle was so upset was, after all, a fictional TV character.  George H.W. Bush, in 1992, campaigned by promising to make American families \"a lot more like the Waltons and a lot less like the Simpsons.\" Bart, one of the animated characters on \"The Simpsons,\" retaliated almost instantly in a quickly dubbed opening credits sequence, replying, \"We're just like the Waltons. We're praying for an end to the Depression, too.\"  Christie, by pulling the state purse strings tighter and refusing to hand over rebate tax credit money to TV productions that make New Jersey look bad, is wielding a heavy club. Where else, after all, could \"Jersey Shore\" film its reality-show escapades? Italy? (Actually, yes. They've done just that. But MTV and \"Jersey Shore\" haven't yet gone to the original Jersey shore, nestled in the English Channel and part of the United Kingdom. Maybe next year.)  Or maybe, if CW's \"H8R\" lasts another season (which is doubtful), Christie could come on as a Snooki \"hater,\" as a nonfan did to confront the \"Jersey Shore\" standout star in this month's season premiere, and take away her show's tax credits on camera.  But really, the biggest media storm he could generate here, and the one that would score him even stronger political points, would be to make the tax credits, or the denial of them, qualitative as well as quantitative, and thus support the arts in the most measurable way possible.  Bear with me here: Christie could make it a policy to give tax rebates for the quality shows, and levy fines -- tackiness taxes, if you will -- for those that besmirch New Jersey in particular and the lively arts in general.  Make good TV and movies, you get money back. Make bad TV and movies, you pay a surcharge.  Under such a system, the better the TV show or movie, the higher the tax incentives. (This works for the other arts as well: Bruce Springsteen could do whatever he wants in Jersey, which is kind of the way things are now anyway.) Conversely, the lower a visiting TV or film production sets the crassness bar, the higher the state should set the additional taxes for filming in Jersey.  That way, when something as outstanding and artistic as \"The Sopranos\" shoots on location in the Garden State, it gets a break.  The \"Real Housewives of New Jersey,\" on the other hand, gets broken.

{"article": "Los Angeles, California (CNN)  -- Turn up the music, crack the window -- falling gas prices have flipped on the road-trip ignition switch.  The Neptune Pool at Hearst Castle is 104 feet long and 95 feet wide at the alcove.  I decided to celebrate the unofficial return of reasonable driving vacations with a venture to the ultimate temple of excess -- Hearst Castle.  From Los Angeles, my family and I retraced the journey of Hollywood luminaries who headed north to hang out with publishing tycoon William Randolph Hearst.  Charlie Chaplin, Cary Grant, Clark Gable, Gregory Peck, Carol Lombard and Hearst's mistress Marion Davies all made the trek to what Hearst called \"La Cuesta Encantada,\" or the Enchanted Hill.  Winston Churchill and President Calvin Coolidge also rested here amid art and antiquities from around the world.  Hearst Castle looks down over golden fields, the glistening Pacific and the town of San Simeon, California, home to less than 500 people.  We took a tour bus from the visitors center to the mansion, a long gull's dive from the ocean, 1,610 feet above sea level.  Hearst hired San Francisco architect Julia Morgan in 1919 and by 1947 the 165-room estate stretched over 127 acres.  It's crystal clear Hearst was a demanding mastermind of his kingdom on the hill, putting Morgan through what must have been agonizing brain twisters.  Visitors see that when Hearst wanted European choir chairs wedged into his assembly room, Morgan made it work. When he wanted elaborate ceilings salvaged from Europe, Morgan expanded their reach to fit into the estate's rooms.  A massive 95 x 104-foot outdoor swimming pool, made of concrete and Vermont marble, is one of the central jewels of the property.  Our guide recounted Hearst house rules. In an effort to control his guests' alcohol consumption, Hearst banned them from bringing their own liquor. The Hollywood types reportedly snuck it in anyway, like frat boys at a football game.  Guests stayed in opulent guest houses adorned with religious icons, art and other worldly treasures.  Hearst mandated unmarried guests sleep apart, while violating his own edict by sleeping with his beloved actress friend Marion Davies. Though Hearst remained married to Millicent Hearst, with whom he had five children, Davies' ghost is everywhere at Hearst Castle.  Images of the actress, along with Charlie Chaplin and others stars, flicker about in a short film shown in the mansion's 50-seat movie theater.  Museum-worthy pieces fill the property, including intricate Flemish tapestries in an east-facing sitting room called the Morning Room.  Owing to my Belgian roots, I looked at the tapestries and cracked to my kids, \"No wonder my 83-year-old mother can still sew a tiny patch onto a Girl Scout vest.\"  The castle's grandeur was enough to hold the childrens' attention. We saw them as young as 4 years old, eyes popping while taking in ancient Egyptian statues or towering Christmas trees.  \"This guy was rich!\" my friend's 7-year-old-son, Nicolas, exclaimed.  Perhaps a headline from Hearst's San Francisco Examiner in another era could best describe our trip:  \"The road to fun is back and affordable!\"", "Q": ["Q: acres overlooking the Pacific A:", "Q: Where is the estate?

{"article": " -- What he lacks in technique, Steve Wozniak makes up for in geeks.  Apple Inc. co-founder Steve Wozniak and his partner show off their moves on \"Dancing With the Stars.\"  The Apple Inc. co-founder has managed to transform his less-than-graceful moves on ABC's \"Dancing With the Stars\" into enough votes to keep hope alive on the competitive ballroom-dance show.  \"Woz,\" as he is known by friends and fans alike, and partner Katarina Smirnoff have had some of the lowest scores from the trio of judges since the show premiered on March 9.  But the judges, who are experts in the field of competitive dance, aren't the only deciding factor.  Viewers can vote online, via phone calls or by text messaging, and those votes comprise 50 percent of each couple's score. The dance team with the lowest combined score is then voted off the show -- a fate that may await Wozniak on Tuesday night.  Wozniak and Smirnoff are up against a bevy of entertainers, including an Olympian, an NFL Hall of Famer, the most successful female rapper in hip-hop history and an actor whose claim to fame is appearing naked in the film \"Sex and the City.\"  But all that star power has so far been matched by the power of computer geeks who are using what they know best to keep the rhythmically challenged Silicon Valley icon in the game.  Chris Harrington, technology director for the Charlotte, North Carolina-based advertising, public relations and new media firm Luquire George Andrews, set up VoteWoz.com and a similarly named Twitter account, which so far has more than 55,000 followers.  Harrington -- who began rallying the techie troops almost as soon as ABC announced that Wozniak would be competing -- said he is rooting for the philanthropist because \"he puts more heart and more passion in what he's doing than some of the other dancers.\"  \"When you have beautiful athletes, movie stars and TV personalities, and then you mix in a geek, there's something a little strange and entertaining,\" Harrington said. \"Being a fellow geek myself, I thought now is the time to work with the technologies that we know and start pushing for the vote.\"  That means lots and lots of social networking to spread the love -- and the word of Woz.  Joe Patane is a longtime friend of Wozniak's and one of the officers for the official \"Vote for Woz on ABC's 'Dancing With the Stars' \" Facebook group.  Patane shares his friend's passion for philanthropy and runs his own foundation and the site joesworld.org. He also knows a bit about reality television.  A former cast member of MTV's \"The Real World: Miami,\" Patane was instrumental in convincing his bud to sign on to the show and said the lovable (though some might argue lumbering) Wozniak has garnered fans both young and old.  \"He loves his fans, and he's completely flattered by the fan response,\" Patane said. \"He's a shy guy, and he's doing a crazy, unique and different thing in his life that he wants to share with the world.\"  Patane, who is also executive producer of the documentary \"Camp Woz: The Admirable Lunacy of Philanthropy,\" said he enjoys watching his friend dance each week.  \"He's the most uniquely giving, loving, happy man,\" Patane said. \"With so many people watching this show, it's a good, infectious way to spread love, joy and hope.\"  Aaron Petrey of Stanford, Kentucky, is one viewer who has fully embraced the Wozniak mania.  He won an autographed copy of the book \"iWoz\" for submitting a video of himself imitating Wozniak's dance moves to VoteWoz.com.  Petrey said it's only natural that fans of Woz would turn to the Internet to support him.  \"Without [Wozniak] there probably wouldn't be a YouTube, Twitter or Facebook,\" Petrey said. \"He's the reason why we even have a computer. I like seeing him on the show.\"  Unfortunately, the \"Dancing With the Stars\" judges don't seem to feel the same way.  Despite dancing through injuries -- including a pulled hamstring that sent him to the hospital in an ambulance last week -- Wozniak failed to impress the experts Monday night.  While he did manage to score a perfect 10, it was a collective 10 out of a possible 30. At one point during Wozniak's and Smirnoff's samba, judge Bruno Tonioli put his face in his hands.  Wozniak capped their routine by doing his version of the break-dance move known as \"the worm,\" but even that failed to save his lackluster performance.  \"At some point the novelty wears off,\" said judge Carrie Ann Inaba, often cited as the kindest of the three.  Wozniak, who beat out former Go-Go's lead singer Belinda Carlisle after a dance-off in an earlier round, kept his smile throughout the storm of criticism.  \"I enjoy it,\" he said on the show afterward. \"I'm going to try to bring my form of entertainment to the world.\"", "Q": ["Q: Who has Wozniak not been a hit with?

{"article": "DOVER AIR FORCE BASE, Delaware (CNN) -- His name was Phillip A. Myers. A staff sergeant in the U.S. Air Force, he was killed in a roadside bombing in Afghanistan on Saturday.  The body of Phillip Myers, 30, arrived at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware on Sunday.  The return of his body to the United States aboard a charter aircraft Sunday marked a solemn moment that has been repeated more than 5,000 times at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware since the start of the war in Afghanistan in late 2001.  Much of this night was like so many of the others: The well-practiced and crisp movement of the carry team silently transferring the body from the plane to the truck that would transport it to the base mortuary and the presence of Myers' family, quietly watching every step and order, ensured dignity and respect for the fallen in an atmosphere that does not lend itself to peace and quiet.  This night, however, was not like the other nights. Watching all of this were about 40 journalists allowed to cover the return of Myers' remains. It was the first time in almost 20 years the return of a fallen U.S. service member was able to be recorded by the media.  Myers' widow was the first to be asked by the military, under a new policy by Defense Secretary Robert Gates, if she wished to have news media at Dover Air Force Base for her husband's final return home. Her decision to do so was historical and allowed the public to see a side of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq the country has not yet seen.  The only noise on the flight line was the perpetual whine of the Atlas Air 747's power generator. This was the plane that had brought Myers and another fallen soldier back to the United States. The media were not allowed to cover the other soldier's transfer and were not given his name or the circumstances of his death, because the family had not granted permission.  On the flight line, journalists were asked not to speak, use camera flashes or make undue movement while watching the transfer.  With cameras rolling, an eight-member carry team wearing battle-dress uniforms and white gloves stood by the flag-draped transfer case carrying Myers, as the chaplain, Maj. Klabens Noel, said a prayer.  Watch the coverage of the return of the fallen service member \u00bb  The team slowly moved the transfer case from the aircraft onto the loader. With a jolt, the quiet of the night was shattered as a diesel engine was started to lower the loader toward the ground and then was shut off.  Bathed in light from the giant floodlights along the flight line, the team hoisted the transfer case and carried it to a waiting panel truck.  As the transfer case was secured, the carry team saluted, the doors of the truck were slowly closed and then driven under police escort to the base mortuary.  Seven family members watched the truck until it was out of sight, one man among them crying into a tissue.  Myers was from Hopewell, Virginia, and died Saturday of wounds suffered in a roadside bombing, the Air Force said.  He was assigned to the 48th Civil Engineer Squadron, with the Royal Air Force Lakenheath, UK, and in March 2008 received the Bronze Star for valor. He was 30 years old. Casualties: Afghanistan | Iraq  The ban on media coverage of returning war dead was implemented by President George Bush in 1991 and the policy has been the subject of much debate since. Some called it censorship; others said it allowed privacy and respect for the families during a very difficult time.  Watch an Army widow call the policy is 'dignified' \u00bb  An exception on the ban by President Bill Clinton in 2000 allowed coverage of the return of sailors killed in the attack on the USS Cole.  Shortly after taking office, President Obama asked Gates to take a look at the policy. In February, Gates reversed it, but with conditions. Family members would be asked if they wanted news media to cover the transfer of their loved one's body. iReport.com: What do you think about this decision?  Service members' support groups had mixed opinions on the change. Some welcomed the change to show the human cost of war, and others opposed it.  \"We are committed to seeing that America's fallen heroes are received back to their loved ones and their country with the honor, respect and recognition that they and their families have earned,\" Gates said after his decision.  \"The overriding principle is that decisions about media coverage should be made by those most affected: the families,\" he said.", "Q": ["Q: Who died in Afghanistan?

{"article": "Lexington, Missouri (CNN) -- Police arrested a sixth member of a Missouri family under investigation for allegations of child sexual abuse, police said.  Darrel Mohler has been charged with two counts of rape, Lafayette County Sheriff Kerrick Alumbaugh said at a news conference. Missouri police did not have Mohler in custody earlier.  On the request of Missouri officials, Marion County authorities went to Mohler's home in Silver Springs, Florida, and caught him just before he pulled into the driveway, according to a news release from the Marion County Sheriff's Office. He was subsequently arrested.  Mohler told police he \"was aware of what was going on in Missouri,\" and that he had not been there since the 1980s, according to the sheriff's office.  Five members of the Mohler family of Lafayette County, Missouri, were arrested earlier this week after six alleged victims, who are relatives of the five suspects, made accusations of sexual abuse. A sixth person, described as an \"associate\" of the family, was arrested Thursday but released Friday, police said.  The six alleged victims -- all now adults -- came to law enforcement authorities with stories of sexual performances, mock weddings, rape with various objects and a forced abortion during their childhoods, according to court documents obtained by CNN affiliate KSHB in Kansas City. CNN does not identify alleged sexual assault victims.  Police did not have enough to charge Darrel Mohler earlier, but after examining the victims' statements, obtained enough information to charge him, Alumbaugh said. He added that he does not think Darrel is on the run.  Darrel Mohler, 72, is the younger brother of Burrell Edward Mohler Sr., 77, according to KSHB. On Tuesday, authorities arrested Mohler Sr. and his sons Burrell Edward Mohler Jr., 53; David A. Mohler, 52; Jared Leroy Mohler, 48; and Roland Neil Mohler, 47.  More charges against the family members are expected next week, the sheriff said. Current charges for some of the arrested include rape, deviate sexual assault and use [of] child in sexual performance, according to Missouri State Courts online case management system.  Alumbaugh said that Larry Kidd, 55, of Kansas City, Missouri -- an \"associate\" of the Mohler family -- was picked up by police following a tip, cooperated with police and has been released.  The alleged abuse took place from the mid-1980s until 1995 and possibly beyond, the sheriff said earlier. The documents provide graphic details of the alleged abuse provided by one of the alleged victims. All of the charges stem from those documents, Alumbaugh said.  Mohler Sr., David Mohler and Jared Mohler are all lay ministers in the Community of Christ, the Independence, Missouri-based organization said in a statement.  Lay ministers are volunteers who do not receive compensation, said the organization, and none of the three served in leadership roles or worked with children.  Mohler Sr. went through the group's registered youth worker program, but \"his youth worker registration has been terminated and we understand he had no contact with children or youth in church programs,\" the statement said.  Some lay ministers might help take care of the church, while others might speak at services, said the organization's spokeswoman, Linda Booth.  The Community of Christ is an offshoot of the modern-day Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. It split off from the Mormon church in the 1800s, and in 2000 changed its name to Community of Christ from the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  Investigators earlier this week searched several properties for evidence, but there were no plans to continue the searches, Alumbaugh said Friday. He declined to comment on any evidence found.

{"article": "MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN) -- Mexican authorities said they have arrested the leader of a drug cartel that set off two grenades during a public celebration in September, killing eight people and wounding more than 100.  Cesar Duarte, president of the federal chamber of deputies, says he supports the government plan on narcotrafficking.  Alberto Espinoza Barron, known as \"the Strawberry,\" heads the \"Michoacan Family,\" which operates in the Mexican states of Michoacan and Mexico, authorities said. Officials say the cartel set off the two grenades September 15 in the public plaza in Morelia, the capital of Michoacan.  Espinoza Barron's arrest Monday, which officials did not confirm until Tuesday, came just days after Mexican officials arrested an army major assigned to a guard unit protecting Mexican President Felipe Calderon. The army major, Arturo Gonzalez Rodriguez, was paid as much as $100,000 a month for passing information to a drug cartel, officials said after the officer's arrest Friday.  Espinoza Barron's arrest by the military as part of its permanent presence in Michoacan came at a time when some are questioning the military's role in the war against narcotics traffickers.  \"I believe that we need to totally change our strategies since the results have been awful,\" said Juan Francisco Rivera of the Mexican Commission on National Security. \"It's not me who is saying that, because the president himself has recognized it. I don't believe the country is willing to keep committing errors.\"  Others believe that the military, known by the acronym SEDENA, is the only institution capable of confronting organized crime.  \"The participation by SEDENA is necessary because there is a threat and harm to national security,\" said Guillermo Velasco, member of an organization called Better Society, Better Government. \"It's known that many of the successes have come from the work done by military intelligence and investigation.\"  Amid this debate, the secretary for national defense recently proposed a 60-year prison term for any military member linked to organized crime.  \"We believe the national defense secretary's position is adequate,\" said Cesar Duarte, president of the federal chamber of deputies. \"We support him with respect to implementing major punishment for elements that are infiltrated or compromised with narcotrafficking.\"  In many parts of the country, narcotraffickers constantly recruit low-level soldiers. The secretary of defense has said that in the past seven years about 100,000 soldiers have quit to join the drug cartels.", "Q": ["Q: What was the Barron's nickname? A:", "Q: What does he head?

{"article": " -- Two new missile production plants opened in Iran on Saturday.   The inauguration of the production lines for the anti-helicopter Qaem missile, and the anti-armor Toofan-5 (Hurricane) missile, came three days after Iran test-launched a rocket capable of carrying a satellite, a launch deemed a \"provocative act\" by Washington.  The Defense Ministry told Iran's semi-official Fars News Agency that both missiles have \"high penetration and destructive powers.\"  By mass producing and delivering these modern arms, Iran's department of defense aims to increase its ground and air defenses, the semi-official Fars news agency reported.  The announcement of new missile production coincided with a 10-day period marking the 31st anniversary of the 1979 Islamic revolution that toppled the U.S.-backed shah.  \"Toofan 5 is one of the most advanced missiles. It has two warheads which can destroy tanks and other armored vehicles,\" Defense Minister Ahmad Vahidi told Fars.  The Qaem is a \"missile which can destroy targets in the air traveling at low speed and at low altitude, especially assault helicopters,\" Vahidi added.  The laser guided anti-helicopter Qaem rocket is designed to resist enemy actions in electronic warfare.  Iran is embroiled in a dispute with the West over its nuclear program and often makes announcements of progress in its military capabilities.  The West suspects Iran of trying to build nuclear bombs, but Iran says its program is for peaceful power generation.  On Friday, Iran's foreign minister said he believes a solution will be reached over a proposed deal to export uranium for enrichment abroad, a demand of Western nations that worry that Tehran plans to use its program to build nuclear weapons.  \"The amount of uranium [for export] is negotiable. But I am confident that a solution can be found,\" Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki said on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference in Germany, Iran's state-run Press TV reported.  Earlier this week, Iran's atomic energy chief said no deal had been struck to export uranium for enrichment.  \"The discussions are still being conducted, and we will inform the nation of any final agreements,\" said Ali Akbar Salehi, director of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, on Wednesday according to the state-run Iranian Labour News Agency.  Asked what countries in addition to France and Brazil were under consideration, he said it was an Asian country but would not name it.  Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has told Press TV that Iran would have \"no problem\" turning over most of its low-enriched uranium to the West for further enrichment. Iranian diplomats had initially accepted the idea, which was proposed by the West, but then rejected a plan put forth by the International Atomic Energy Agency, the atomic watchdog of the United Nations.  \"In our opinion, there are no issues with the exchange\" of 3 percent to 5 percent enriched uranium for 20 percent enriched uranium, Ahmadinejad said.  He added that, if the West were to refuse to return the enriched fuel, world opinion would shift.  \"If they don't live up to their agreement, the international atmosphere will change in our favor,\" he said.  \"They [Western countries] can come and build 20 nuclear power plants for us; Russia, France and the United States can come and sign contracts and build the power plants. It serves our interests as well as theirs. Of course if they don't come to do this, we will reach a point to build our own power plants.\"  Mottaki on Friday said Ahmadinejad's comments show that the Islamic republic is \"eager\" to discuss the proposal.

{"article": "NEW YORK (CNN) -- Just blocks from where U.N. diplomats debate their interpretations of tyranny and democracy, what may be the first document to articulate the difference is going up for sale.  The version of the Magna Carta up for auction has been on display at the National Archives in Washington.  Sotheby's will auction off one of the earliest versions of the Magna Carta later this year, the auction house announced Tuesday.  This will be the first time any version of the Magna Carta has ever gone up for auction, according to David Redden, vice chairman of Sotheby's.  The Magna Carta is expected to fetch at least $20 million to $30 million, Redden said.  Redden, who has also sold dinosaur bones, space race artifacts and a first printing of the Declaration of Independence, called the Magna Carta \"the most important document on earth.\"  The charter mandated the English king to cede certain basic rights to his citizens, ensuring that no man is above the law.  Many believe the Magna Carta was the first document to recognize the legal right to freedom from tyranny, an influential concept to American political philosophers -- from the founding fathers to the modern presidency.  The version to be auctioned is one of fewer than 20 known copies of the Magna Carta, which means \"Great Charter\" in Latin. The document was first devised in 1215, but not confirmed into English law until 1297 -- the year this version was issued and sealed by King Edward I.  The document is one of only two copies of the charter that exist outside of England, according to Sotheby's. This Magna Carta and another version in Australia are the only two ever to have been privately sold.  The version up for auction rested for six centuries with the Brundell family in Deene Park, England, until being bought in 1984 by businessman Ross Perot. Since then, the Perot Foundation has kept the copy on display at the National Archives in Washington.  The Perot Foundation plans to distribute the money from the auction to various causes such as medical research and helping wounded soldiers.

{"article": "Fort Lauderdale, Florida (CNN)  -- Three teens accused of setting a 15-year-old friend on fire pleaded not guilty Thursday to charges of attempted murder, a public defender for one of the boys said.  Denver Jarvis and Matthew Bent, both 15, and Jesus Mendez, 16, are charged as adults with one count of attempted murder in the second degree in the October 12 attack in Deerfield Beach, Florida.  They were arraigned in Broward County Circuit Court before Judge Dale Cohen and are being held without bond.  Two other boys ages 13 and 15 have been charged as juveniles.  Prosecutors say Jarvis, Bent and Mendez were in a gang that poured alcohol over Michael Brewer, 15, then set him ablaze in a dispute over $40, a video game and a bicycle.  Brewer jumped into the swimming pool at his apartment complex to put out the flames, witnesses say.  Brewer suffered burns over 65 percent of his body. He's reported in guarded condition at the University of Miami's Jackson Memorial Hospital Burn Center, where he's been in a private room since the incident.  Gordon Weekes, the attorney for Bent, denounced the fact that the teens were charged as adults.  \"It's been decided by society that a 15-year-old can't vote, can't join the armed forces and cannot buy alcohol, because society has recognized that children do not have the ability to appreciate the long-term consequences of their actions,\" he said.  \"But they can treat them as adults in court, when we have very capable remedies for them in the juvenile justice system, which is geared toward rehabilitation,\" he said.  Weekes said he and the other two public defenders plan to make separate motions to the court asking that their clients be allowed to post bond.  Detectives say witnesses told them that Mendez used a lighter to set fire to Brewer after Jarvis poured alcohol over him. They said Matthew Bent encouraged the attack.  Authorities say Mendez admitted setting Brewer on fire, and that he made a \"bad decision,\" according to an arrest transcript.  Detectives with the Broward County Sheriff's Office have been unable to interview Brewer. Until last week, he had been on a ventilator to keep him alive.  \"We hope that we can maybe get a statement this week,\" said sheriff's spokesman Jim Leljedal.  \"Detectives have been waiting for him to recover to the point where he's strong enough to give us a complete statement,\" he said.  Doctors say Brewer is improving but his condition is tenuous because of the severity of his burns and the possibility of infections. Most of his burns are on his back and buttocks; his face and hands were largely spared, doctors say.  Brewer's doctor told CNN the teen faces several more months in the hospital and will need multiple skin grafts and surgeries.  \"They still have to perform several operations on him for skin grafting, but his parents are with him all the time,\" said Lorraine Nelson, a hospital spokeswoman.  \"I don't tell him what happened,\" Brewer's mother, Valerie, told CNN affiliate WFOR-TV. \"I just tell him he's in the hospital and he's safe and he's getting better.  \"And he'll say, 'Am I going to be OK?' And I say 'Yes, Michael. You're going to be fine. You're going to be just fine,' \" she said.  Investigators believe Brewer owed Bent $40 for a video game. When Brewer did not pay, Bent stole Brewer's father's bicycle, police say. When Brewer reported him to the police, Bent was arrested.  The next day, the group surrounded Brewer. The five boys called Brewer \"a snitch\" and set him on fire, witnesses said.  The Brewer family told WFOR that none of the families of the accused boys have tried to contact them, but it doesn't matter.  \"We can't focus on it. They'll get theirs is all we can say. I don't focus on it,\" Michael Brewer's father, also named Michael, told WFOR.  If convicted they could face up to 30 years in prison.  A court-appointed psychologist who has examined two of the five boys told CNN they are competent to take part in legal proceedings and assist their attorney.  \"I can describe both of them as being afraid, being fearful,\" said forensic psychologist Michael Brannon, who did not identify the boys.  \"I can describe both of them as being tearful at various times during the interview, especially when talking about the specific incident which led to the injuries of the victim,\" he said.  Psychologists are often brought into cases involving teenagers and young adults to judge their mental capabilities and determine their competency to proceed. Psychologists also must evaluate whether the defendants can talk about what happened and communicate effectively with defense attorneys.  \"I don't think they expected to have happened, what happened,\" Brannon said. \"It's a horrible event that occurred, but this was not their conceptualization, in my opinion, of what was going to happen.\"", "Q": ["Q: what has the attorney denounced A:", "Q: what does the attorney denounce?

{"article": "(Oprah.com) -- On any given day here at \"O, The Oprah Magazine,\" there are somewhere in the neighborhood of 69 very talented, extremely detail oriented, high-energy, hardworking women and men all doing their jobs and doing them well. I love a few of them, I like a lot of them, I despise one of them. She is the Magneto to my Wolverine, the Saruman to my Frodo, the Dr. Octopus to my Spiderman. I call her The Tinkler.  It's a typical Tuesday; the office is humming along. I'm answering e-mails, writing cover lines, scheduling a dental appointment here, partial highlights there, kicking myself for not getting sushi at lunch. The sun is shining, the color printer is working -- my life is good.  I mosey into the ladies' room, glance at the mirror, remind myself that fluorescent lights make everyone look as if they're in the final stages of tuberculosis, and head for a stall. And then I see it: The seat, even the floor, is covered in little yellow droplets. The Tinkler strikes again.  To date, I have been able to deduce only four things about her:  1. She is female.  2. She attacks between the hours of 10 a.m. and 8 p.m.  3. She works alone.  4. She was raised in a barn.  I've been her victim more times than I can count, and it has turned me from a happy-go-lucky columnist into a bitter, paranoid germaphobe.  She has become the bane of my existence. We live in a world where our soldiers lack sufficient body armor, where Rupert Murdoch is blurring the line intended to keep the business and political interests of media owners from influencing the presentation of news, where the White House still refuses to respond to questions they promised to answer as soon as the Scooter Libby case was closed, where studies indicate that worrying you're going to get sick will actually get you sick -- and yet I am devoting an entire column to The Tinkler.  Any shrink worth his or her salt will tell you that it is a mistake to think of your colleagues as family. But what is a family if not a group of people who care about you and irritate you and show up for cake on your birthday and look at pictures of your kid even when they don't feel like it and think it wouldn't kill you to put on a little makeup and a pair of heels once in a while?  I've been earning a paycheck for 30 years. Whether rinsing conditioner off a Lhasa apso during my stint as shampoo girl at Mr. Whiskers Pet Boutique or breathing on the chicken breast I was about to serve a rude diner during my waitressing days, I've always found that the people I work with matter to me. Their moods, their opinions, their style influence my life. They've appreciated me, humiliated me, surprised me, and antagonized me. I've gotten flowers and I've gotten fired (and I'm pretty sure I didn't do anything to deserve either), but I've never experienced anything like The Tinkler.  \"Dammit!\" I say upon encountering her latest Jackson Pollock imitation. Pat, Suzan, and Valerie each come out of their stalls to see what's wrong. I point in horror. Pat groans, Suzan moans, Val throws up her hands in disgust, and we fall into silence.  Then I rally, \"At least we know it's not one of us.\" But everybody else is a suspect. \"It can't be Sudie,\" Suzan volunteers. My eyes narrow. \"What are you basing this on?\" I ask. \"I've seen her,\" she answers, \"she always heads straight for the paper seat protector.\" \"And,\" Valerie adds, \"we can cross Mamie off the list -- it happened twice while she was in Sweden.\"  Sixty seconds ago, the four of us were editors; now we are FBI profilers. \"She probably likes to burrow into small spaces,\" Pat conjectures. \"This never happens in the big, wheelchair-accessible stall...\" \"It's very primitive, as if she's marking her territory. This is clearly a hostile gesture,\" Suzan declares with authority.  We're finally getting somewhere. \"So, really,\" I say, \"we just need to be on the lookout for an aggressively mean-spirited, mole-like cavewoman who is not confined to a wheelchair.. is that right?\" Val is the first to realize that we're losing our minds. \"I'm out of here,\" she says, and exits the ladies' room.  Later, I complain to J.J., poor, naive little J.J.. She tells me that it can't be any of us, that the toilet is somehow to blame. I leave J.J. in her special world -- a place where troubles melt like lemon drops and Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone -- and resume writing my column. Gina drops by and reads over my shoulder.  Suddenly she has an epiphany: \"It's you!\" she announces, pointing at me like she's Javert accusing Jean Valjean of stealing silver candlesticks. \"Think about it,\" she says. \"What better way to cover your tracks than writing an outraged piece on the subject?\" I kind of like that Gina believes I am an evil genius, and I don't have the heart to tell her that I once refused to sit my daughter on the lap of a department store Santa Claus because I had no idea who else had been sitting there.  Another day, another bathroom break. \"Steer clear of the third stall,\" Yeun warns as she dries her hands and heads for a meeting. Jennifer emerges from door number four to see what exactly's going on behind door number three. She is appalled yet philosophical. \"Believe it or not, every place I've ever worked has had a Tinkler -- maybe sharing a ladies' room just sends certain people into a passive-aggressive snit. It's the dark side of office life.\"  Lately, my daydreams bear a striking resemblance to one of those black-and-white Sherlock Holmes movies: The entire team sits, sipping brandy in an ornate drawing room. \"I suppose you're wondering why I've gathered you here today,\" I begin in an inexplicable British accent. \"Well, my friends, one of you is The Tinkler.\"  The research department averts their eyes. The art department fidgets nervously. An intern gasps. \"And,\" I go on, \"nobody is leaving this room until I reveal the person who refuses to work and play well with others.\" My assistant, Polly, looks up. \"You mean you've figured out the identity of The Tinkler?\" she asks, filled with an admiration for my powers of reasoning that she has never once expressed in real life. \"It was elementary, dear Watson. I merely -- \" but before I can unmask The Tinkler or explain why I refer to Polly as dear Watson, the lights suddenly go out...  I could go on, but I'm bored silly whenever someone feels compelled to relay every nanosecond of a dream. Suffice it to say that I usually wind up in the arms of Tyrone Power. As for The Tinkler? She's still on the lam.  There are lots of days when I find myself wishing life were closer to a gorgeous movie from the '40s -- women wore fabulous hats and pearl chokers, and I don't think they actually went to the bathroom back then. They were too busy dancing with Fred Astaire and smoking unfiltered cigarettes to schlep to an office every day.  Now, some of us are running the offices, but it seems we've brought a few low-grade lunatics along for the ride -- and they're wreaking havoc in the ladies' room. Where have you gone, Edith Wharton? I'm not asking for cloth napkins and classical music. I don't need a mint on my pillow. I just want a bit of common courtesy, a modicum of civility, a touch of class, or, failing all that, a good supply of Lysol.

{"article": "Washington (CNN) -- Minerals Management Service Director Elizabeth Birnbaum has been fired, according to two CNN sources.  A senior administration official has told CNN that an official announcement will be made during President Barack Obama's news conference scheduled for Thursday afternoon.  The decision to fire Birnbaum comes in the wake of a recently released report highlighting what many observers have characterized as widespread corruption at the Minerals Management Service (MMS), which is part of the Interior Department.  The period covered by the report was prior to the April explosion in the Gulf of Mexico that sank the oil rig Deepwater Horizon, resulting in a massive oil spill that well owner BP and federal authorities are still trying to cap.  Among other things, the report, issued by the Interior Department's inspector general, revealed that federal inspectors overseeing oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico accepted meals and tickets to sporting events from companies they monitored.  In one case, an inspector in the MMS office in Lake Charles, Louisiana, conducted inspections of four offshore platforms while negotiating a job with the company, the report stated.  The Lake Charles investigation was launched shortly after another scandal emerged from within the MMS. A September 2008 inspector general's report found regulators in the agency's Colorado office received improper gifts from energy industry representatives and engaged in illegal drug use and inappropriate sexual relations with them.  Interior Secretary Ken Salazar recently called the allegations of MMS corruption \"evidence of the cozy relationship between some elements of [the agency] and the oil and gas industry.\"  He pledged to follow through with the Interior Department inspector general's recommendations, \"including taking any and all appropriate personnel actions including termination, discipline and referrals of any wrongdoing for criminal prosecution.\"  Salazar insisted Thursday in testimony before a House subcommittee, however, that Birnbaum had resigned \"on her own terms and own volition.\"  She \"is a strong and very effective person who, among other things, helped us break through the very difficult things which we have a lot more work to do,\" Salazar said. \"She helped us with addressing a very broken system. And all I can really [say] is that she is a good public servant.\"  MMS collected nearly $10 billion in royalties from the energy and mining industries in 2009. Salazar recently announced that he was splitting up the agency to separate its energy development, enforcement and revenue collection divisions, saying they have \"conflicting missions\" that needed to be separated.  The associate director for the agency's Offshore Minerals Management Program is leaving at the end of May, a month earlier than planned, in the wake of the Gulf spill. That official, Chris Oynes, launched the investigation that resulted in former New Orleans, Louisiana, supervisor Donald Howard's firing in 2007. Howard later pleaded guilty after being accused of failing to report gifts valued  at more than $6,600 from an offshore drilling contractor.  As part of the growing push to crack down on the MMS, Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Florida, introduced legislation Wednesday requiring federal oil industry regulators to wait at least two years after leaving government service before going to work for companies they helped regulate.  Among other things, the bill would bar regulators from accepting gifts from oil companies. It also would require regulators to divest themselves of any stock they may currently hold in oil companies, and prohibit regulators from part-time employment in the industry.", "Q": ["Q: Who has been fired?

{"article": "ROOSEVELT, New York (CNN) -- When Lisa Brown moved into her rental house on Long Island last summer with her three daughters, she says, it felt like a new beginning.  Lisa Brown has to move out of her rental house because it is facing foreclosure  After living in apartments, the spacious house got her attention immediately. \"It was bigger than what I had lived in,\" she says. Brown was also won over by the neighborhood with its tidy homes and good school district. \"I wanted to come here, and I wanted to see my kids graduate from this school district.\"  But they hardly had a chance. Instead, fighting back tears, she says, \"I have to get out.\"  Brown and her family are being evicted not because of anything they did, but because her landlord defaulted on the mortgage and the house fell into foreclosure. The house was recently sold at auction.  The bad news came just seven months after Brown had moved in. A real estate broker came to the door and handed her an eviction notice, telling her she had 30 days to vacate. \"I was hysterical, I was like, what do you mean?\"  Watch Lisa Brown's talk about why she has to move \u00bb  The broker explained that the landlord no longer owns the property and that the lease was no longer valid. Brown had no idea the house was in foreclosure.  As a tenant, she always paid her rent on time, and she assumed the rent was going toward the mortgage.  \"I didn't see there was a problem,\" she said. \"You know, I'm paying rent, and she's putting it toward her mortgage, I didn't see the problem.\"  Unfortunately, Brown is not the only tenant caught off guard. According to the Center for Housing Policy, nearly 20 percent of all foreclosures are on rental properties, and tenants' rights in such situations are minimal.   In most states, when a bank forecloses on a landlord, the tenant has no guarantee of being allowed to stay in the property, and neither the bank nor the landlord has a legal obligation to tell the tenant about the foreclosure. So while the owners know what's going on, renters are usually kept in the dark.  New York State Sen. Jeff Klein is aware that renters can run into problems. \"In many instances, they're actually paying their rent on time, and the owner of the property who is in foreclosure is pocketing the money,\" he says.  Klein says rental properties are involved in 50 percent of all foreclosures in New York, and he is working on a law to warn renters of foreclosure proceedings ahead of time and to keep them from losing their security deposit and being evicted with nowhere to go.  Similar laws are already in place in Ohio, Illinois, Minnesota, Maryland, Rhode Island, Michigan and California. \"What we're facing here\", Klein says, \"is sort of the new homeless population unless we do something about it.\"  Brown was astonished to learn that her landlord rented her the house when she knew she was losing it. \"She knew that this house was foreclosing on her. She did nothing about it. Nothing, except take my money.\"  Brown was paying $1,900 a month in rent. She had also paid $5,700 for a security deposit and broker fees to secure the house. She says that money is gone. \"She will not give me my deposit back. Nothing.\"  CNN tried to reach the owner, who lives upstairs, for comment, but her phone was disconnected, and no one answered the door. The broker who rented her the house and who was paid $1,900 says he did not know the house was in foreclosure. He also says the brokerage fee will not be returned.  \"It took everything I had to move in,\" Brown says, \"to give my kids a better environment.\" And now, \"I'm left out with nothing.\"  Because eviction papers trump the lease, Brown has no legal right to stay. The bank that foreclosed on the house, and now owns it, offered her $1,000 to get out, but she says she's lost close to $6,000 and has nowhere to go.  \"If it was me, yeah I could move out and go on my own. But it's my family you're talking about, my children, my three daughters and my pets, that I brought in here thinking that we were going to stay and be happy.\"  Brown is considering suing the owner in small-claims court to get her money back and cover moving expenses. For now, though, she says she will adjust her dreams and find another place for her family to live.", "Q": ["Q: Who was evicted? A:", "Q: Who is working on a law to help renters?

{"article": " -- The Italian government has approved the creation of a new task force of 500 soldiers who will be deployed to combat the recent wave of Mafia crime in the country.  The army has been deployed in major cities aross Italy since the early summer.  Defense Minister Ignazio La Russa told the ANSA press agency Tuesday that ''the majority'' of the troops would be sent to the southern city of Naples following the worst ever Camorra massacre last week, that left an Italian and six Africans dead.  La Russa said that the 500 troops will be in addition to the 3,000 soldiers deployed alongside police in major Italian cities this summer, ANSA reported.  ''The troops could be deployed for three months and (perform) the functions of manning check points,'' he said.  This will be the second time since the 1990s that the army has been sent in to combat Mafia crime in southern Italy, ANSA said.  Thousands of soldiers were sent to Sicily in 1992 following the murder of anti-Mafia judges Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino. They stayed on the southern island until 1998 in an operation dubbed the Sicilian Vespers.  The Casalesi Camorra clan is believed to have been behind Thursday's killings, which began with the shooting of an amusement arcade's 53-year-old Italian owner, known to have had links with the clan, ANSA said.  Twenty minutes later, three Ghanaians, two Liberians and a Togo national were shot dead at a shop where local residents often brought clothes for minor adjustments. A third Liberian died in hospital Friday morning.  According to ANSA, police said the murders were drug-related but also ''a signal'' that the Casalesi were still strong in the area despite a raft of recent arrests.  The Casalesi clan is one of the most feared Camorra gangs. It controls drug trafficking and prostitution in the Caserta region, near Naples.", "Q": ["Q: How many people did the Camorra clan kill?

{"article": " -- U.S. President George W. Bush told a global climate change conference Friday that the United States will do its part to improve the environment by taking on greenhouse gas emissions.  U.S. President George W. Bush Friday tells a global climate change conference \"we take this issue seriously.\"  \"We take this issue seriously,\" he said at the Major Economies Meeting on Energy Security and Climate Change, which the White House sponsored.  In his address, Bush called on \"all the world's largest producers of greenhouse gas emissions, including developed and developing nations,\" to come together and \"set a long-term goal for reducing\" greenhouse emissions.  \"By setting this goal, we acknowledge there is a problem, and by setting this goal, we commit ourselves to doing something about it,\" he said.  Watch Bush address the climate conference \u00bb  \"By next summer, we will convene a meeting of heads of state to finalize the goal and other elements of this approach, including a strong and transparent system for measuring our progress toward meeting the goal we set.... Only by doing the necessary work this year will it be possible to reach a global consensus at the U.N. in 2009.\"  Bush said it will be up to each nation to \"design its own separate strategies for making progress toward achieving this long-term goal.\"  He said new technology, such as clean coal technology and biofuels, could help reduce greenhouse gases. He also called for more use of nuclear, wind and solar power.  \"It was said that we faced a choice between protecting the environment and producing enough energy. Today we know better,\" the president said. \"These challenges share a common solution: technology.\"  \"We must lead the world to produce fewer greenhouse gas emissions, and we must do it in a way that does not undermine economic growth or prevent nations from delivering greater prosperity for their people,\" he said.  \"We know this can be done,\" Bush said. \"Last year, America grew our economy while also reducing greenhouse gases.\"  If the preliminary numbers stand, it would make 2006 the first time in Bush's presidency that greenhouse emissions dropped.  In prepared remarks this week, Assistant Secretary of Energy Karen Harbert said, \"Preliminary data for 2006 suggests an absolute reduction in energy-related carbon dioxide emissions of 1.3 percent for that year despite economic growth of 2.9 percent.\"  In previous years, the administration also has said its policies were reducing greenhouse emissions, but Department of Energy figures through 2005 show emission figures went up each year.  The administration also said during those years it was reducing \"greenhouse emissions intensity,\" a term referring to the ratio between emissions and the size of the economy. The administration said the economy was growing at a faster rate than the emissions themselves.  While the White House has taken heat for its environmental policies -- including from some Republicans such as Sen. John McCain -- Bush said at the conference Friday, \"By working together, we will set wise and effective policies.\"  He added, \"I want to get the job done. We have identified a problem -- let's go solve it together.\"  Other nations have been critical of the Bush administration's policy on climate change after the United States withdrew from the 1997 U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, known as the Kyoto Protocol.  That protocol, which was signed by more than 150 countries,  called on industrialized nations to cut greenhouse emissions in absolute terms. It did not make that demand of developing nations. The protocol expires in 2012.  Representatives of 16 countries, the United Nations and the European Union are attending this week's two-day conference. The Bush administration has billed it as an initiative to develop a common approach to combat global warming following  Kyoto's collapse.  At a Group of Eight conference in June, Bush pushed for a new framework on global gas emissions to counter the effects of global warming.  Bush said he believes every nation should set its own goals. The president expressed concern that setting strict targets would damage the U.S. economy. Instead, he said, industries should enact voluntary measures.  On Thursday, U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice also told delegates to the global climate change conference that countries around the world must work together to combat climate change, much as they cooperate against terror and the spread of disease.  \"No one nation, no matter how much power or political will it possesses, can succeed alone,\" she said. \"We all need partners, and we all need to work in concert.\"  Rice said the United States takes climate change seriously, \"for we are both a major economy and a major emitter.\"  In her address to the Major Economies Meeting, Rice said an integrated response, including \"environmental stewardship, economic growth, energy supply and security and development and the development and deployment of new clean energy technology,\" is the key to moving forward on the issue.

{"article": "Rome, Italy (CNN) -- Seeking to identify the man who shot dead another man outside a store in Naples, Italy, in the spring, an anti-mafia prosecutor distributed on Thursday a video showing the execution.  The surveillance-camera video, shot May 11, shows a man wearing a baseball cap, dark jersey, blue jeans and running shoes entering a store, walking to the back and looking around, then walking out. As he exits, he pulls a pistol from his right front pants pocket and shoots a man standing outside the store.  As the victim buckles to his knees and then sprawls headlong on the pavement, the killer approaches him from behind and squeezes off a second round into the back of his head, turns and strides unhurriedly out of camera view.  Passers-by appear unfazed. One woman tries to lift the victim's head in an apparent attempt to see whether she knows him; a man steps over the body.  \"Indeed, it is ugly to see people behaving as if that was not a dead body and going on their daily routine,\" a police spokesman said. \"Unfortunately, this is not an anomaly in Naples and in that neighborhood.\"  He said fear led people to behave that way.  The spokesman, who asked not to be identified, said anti-mafia prosecutor Sergio Amato released the video to the media in hopes that someone would recognize the killer and his apparent accomplice: a man who had been standing next to the victim and walked off just before the shooting.  Police said no motive has been determined for the killing, which took place in the poor neighborhood of Rione Sanita, where Camorra -- the name for organized crime in Naples -- is strong.  The victim was a bank robber, the spokesman said.  Italian Minister for Equal Opportunities Maria Rosaria Carfagna called the video \"tragic.\"  \"It shows us, finally, without any censorship, a disgusting side of the Camorra, which along with all the rest of its disgusting faces, has forced a city, a region, a territory, to be ashamed of itself and to hide its real face.  \"A street homicide, in broad daylight, in the center of a great European city cannot be considered normal and even less be accepted by the conscience of all Italians as if it were a TV show,\" she said.  \"The police forces are waging a battle against organized crime, as the number of arrests shows us. The state is there and in strong force. But, and I speak here as someone from the Campania region, Naples and all of Campania need not only a strong political force but the courage of all its citizens.\"  Roberto Saviano, author of the book \"Gomorrah,\" which details the Camorra, called the video \"shocking.\"  \"What is shocking about this video is the absolute serenity of the people around the victim,\" he told the daily newspaper La Repubblica.  Saviano, who has lived under police protection since shortly after his book was published in 2006, added, \"Unfortunately, though, when a city is at war, its citizens undergo and live almost with normal indifference.\"  Italy's Green Party is offering 2,000 euros ($2,963) to whoever helps investigators identify the suspects.  \"The Camorra pays them to keep quiet; we pay them to speak,\" said Francesco Emilio Borelli, head of the Green Party in the Campania region.

{"article": " -- A crowd plunders buildings crumbled by last week's earthquake, hauling off water, food, candles and anything else recoverable. Suddenly, a pickup truck hauling a half dozen armed policemen squeals to a halt.  The mob scatters as the police officers in military style camouflage fire shots in the air and apprehend a few stragglers, some with a kick or a punch.  Such scenes occurred with increased frequency Monday in Port-au-Prince, the devastated Haitian capital, as frustrated survivors resorted to scrounging and looting due to a lack of relief aid. The rising tension raised questions about the ability of the Haitian National Police to maintain order and its tactics in doing so.  While the United States is sending thousands of troops to assist in relief efforts, U.S. officials say the Haitian police are responsible for security on the streets, with backing from U.N. peacekeepers.  \"The first line of law and order here is, number one, the Haitian police, number two, the U.N. forces,\" U.S. Ambassador Kenneth Merten said Monday. \"The U.S. forces are standing by to provide security as needed.\"  That seems to be an overwhelming task for the Haitian National Police (HNP), a force of about 9,000 that is the impoverished Caribbean nation's lone security apparatus.  Latest updates | Full coverage  National Police Chief Mario Andresol told CNN Monday that the department has been severely affected by the earthquake, with thousands of officers injured, killed or unaccounted for. The Port-au-Prince force of 4,000 has dropped to about 1,500, he said.  Complicating matters even further, roughly another 4,000 \"bad guys\" are on the run, Andresol added, after the 95-year-old, badly overcrowded National Penitentiary in the capital collapsed and the inmates escaped.  \"Today, we have double work,\" Andresol said, adding that the police department is bring in troops from other parts of the country. \"There are not enough, so we are trying.\"  Bill Clinton, the former U.S. president who is the U.N. special envoy to Haiti, said Sunday that 40 percent of the Haitian police force has reported for duty since the January 12 temblor. It was unclear how many other police officers died and how many were struggling with the overwhelming hardships from such widespread destruction.  First formed in 1995, the civilian police force took over security from a disbanded military known for loyalty to dictators instead of the state, noted Brian Concannon Jr., director of the non-profit Institute for Justice and Democracy in Haiti.  A lack of money and other resources over the years, along with continued instability including a 2004 coup, has left the police force under-funded, under-trained and full of former soldiers prone to operating outside the law, Concannon said.  For example, he cited summary executions of suspected criminals as a problem since the 2004 coup, along with police involvement in gangs or other criminal activity.  In addition, a dysfunctional judicial system undermines the ability of the police force to deal with chronic crime problems in Port-au-Prince and elsewhere, according to Concannon.  High-resolution photos of damage | Google map  Progress has occurred in recent years, as the government simultaneously tried to remove \"bad apples\" from the police force while expanding the number of policemen on the streets, Concannon said.  \"Although the HNP's efforts resulted in significantly increased levels of physical security and policing effectiveness, in many cases the HNP could not prevent or respond to gang-related and other societal violence due to an insufficient number of officers and inadequate equipment or training,\" said a 2008 report on Haiti by Concannon's group.  Now the earthquake will set back the reform effort.  \"There's no doubt the Haitian national police took a significant blow in this disaster,\" U.S. Assistant Secretary of State P.J. Crowley said Monday.  U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told CNN on Monday that he would ask for an additional 2,000 U.N. troops and 1,500 U.N. police officers to bolster the 3,000 U.N. police and soldiers currently deployed in Port-au-Prince -- among the 9,000 U.N. troops in Haiti.  According to Ban, the additional forces would \"help humanitarian assistance be delivered in a safe way.\"  Concannon said Haitians coping with the disaster will be patient as long as they see aid arriving. He worried that excessive concerns about security was slowing the aid.  \"I am afraid you're going to have an escalating spiral where people who were willing to be patient lose their patience due to supplies being withheld for security reasons,\" Concannon said. \"And then that impatience escalates and brings increased security, which further cuts the flow of supplies.\"  CNN's Anderson Cooper and Jason Carroll contributed to this report.", "Q": ["Q: Where are US forces standing by?

{"article": "Editor's note: With fears of a swine flu pandemic rising daily, CNN Pentagon producer Larry Shaughnessy remembered a batch of letters from his grandfather, a World War I soldier who battled the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918-1919.  Martin \"Al\" Culhane, left, is pictured with his older brother, Frank, around 1918 or 1919.  WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- \"I'm coming, I'm coming For my head is bending low I hear those gentle voices calling Old Black Joe\"  As World War I rages in Europe, fresh U.S. Army soldiers pass the time on a train ride to to Camp Forrest, Georgia. \"The boys are just starting to sing,\" Martin Aloysius Culhane wrote on September 6, 1918, to his friend back home. \"They've gotten back to 'Old Black Joe' so far.\"  Stephen Foster's classic song from the Civil War is about the death of slaves who had become his friends. But Culhane, known as \"Al,\" and the soldiers who sang along could not know how much death would hunt the recruits on that train, most of whom never made it to Europe to fight in the Great War.  They would find themselves in the deadliest influenza pandemic in history.  Culhane's letters to his older brother Frank and his long-time \"chum\" Clif Pinter are a young soldier's firsthand account of life as a draftee private and how he coped with a disease that would haunt Army camps around the United States and eventually infect people around the world. Some estimates say as many as 50 million people were killed by what's called the Spanish influenza in 1918 and 1919, far more than the number killed in combat during the war.  Three weeks after the train trip to Georgia, Culhane, a 21-year-old clothing salesman from Chicago, Illinois, writes again. Already the flu occupies his thoughts.  Learn more about the current swine flu \u00bb  \"Received a nice letter from Phil Byrne he reports he is getting along fine, is feeling better than he has ever before.\" Byrne, a friend from Chicago, was one of the early survivors of the Spanish flu. Other members of the Byrne family took ill a few months later, according to the letters.  In the same letter he mentions how the Army was trying to protect the troops at Camp Forrest:  \"Since noon today our camp has been under quarantine to prevent an epidemic of Spanish influenza. We have had no cases thus far but it is the intention of the medical officers to prevent any case of the disease from making an appearance. All the men who have even slight colds have been put into separate barrack which, of course, were immediately christened 'the TB ward' by the rest of the company.\"  That same day, September 28, 1918, he wrote his brother Frank, a Navy sailor at home awaiting orders, \"Well the Spanish Influenza has made an appearance here and we are under strict orders no visits to Chattanooga, we are certainly the hard luck guys when it comes to this quarantine proposition.\"  At first the threat of Spanish flu is just an inconvenience for Culhane: \"I am just about fed up with staying in a district about a block square for three weeks. There is no canteen in the quarantine district and we have a hell of a time getting small supplies.\"  Just six days after complaining about the inconvenience, a brief but frightening note: \"Receive the enclosed letter for your information then see that Frank gets it unknown to the rest of the family.\"  What Culhane didn't want his mother, sister and younger brother to know was that he was in the infirmary with the Spanish flu. He asks his friend Clif to write often and encourage letters from \"my friends, without of course, telling them that I am a little under the weather.\" His euphemism hid the fact that in some places more than 30 percent of people who contracted Spanish flu died. In the United States the mortality rate was lower, but still a devastating 3 percent.  It was a crisis for the Army. Military bases, with thousands of men from all over the country in tightly packed barracks, were fertile breeding grounds for the flu, especially one as easily spread as this one. And unlike most flu strains that mostly strike the elderly, the very young or the sick, Spanish flu hit healthy, young adults like Army draftees.  Just three days after telling his friend about being sick, Culhane wrote that he was feeling better.  \"I am still in quarantine but will be released today. I am feeling great and the two day's rest has done me a world of good. I have done nothing at all but sit in the shade, read and write letters.\"  His recovery from the Spanish flu was swift, but the very next day, October 7, 1918, he wrote to give \"all the details of the death of a very good friend, my Bunkie, Thomas Birdie. His body will go north today, I think,\" Culhane wrote, asking Pinter to attend the wake. \"At his side, say a few prayers for the repose of his soul.\"  When not writing about the flu, Culhane dropped none-too-subtle hints about wanting care packages full of cookies from home. And he regularly questioned why other friends didn't write.  He also worried that he was \"neglecting the ladies.\" He pelts his friend Clif with questions about Ursula (\"Her Majesty,\" he jokingly refers to her), Ella (the young woman to whom he promised a prized golf club) Ida (\"I had a long letter from Ida Flynn. Boy! I will have a job on my hands when I get home\") and the Marys (Mary Rose, Mary English, Mary Anne).  While Culhane writes about and to a lot of young ladies, there is no sign in the letters which one, if any, held a special place in his heart. Still he worried about one young man named \"Hank\" who remained in Chicago.  \"Keep the ladies amused by all means, but I look to you to protect my interests. Hank is too darn nice a chap to be safe around the ladies. However, if he seems to get extra strong I will write a note and have him made Admiral of the Arctic Circle.\"  After recovering from the flu, Culhane bemoans the fact that war was about to end.  \"It is almost over now and thirty days will see at least a cessation of hostilities. Xmas will see peace. I will never see France and as long as that is impossible I might as well be out of the Army as soon as it is over.\" Nine days later, on the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month the war ended.  And just four days after the fighting in Europe ended, the letters from Camp Forrest stopped. Al Culhane was sick again. This time he was taken to U.S. General Hospital #14 at Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia. And he couldn't keep the latest illness a secret from his family back home in Chicago. A Catholic chaplain wrote the family that he was sick and not able to write himself.  When he was well enough, he wrote Pinter, \"I don't know just what I have but it felt like old fashioned grip or perhaps 'The Flu.'\".  It took about two weeks before he was out of the Fort Oglethorpe hospital and back at Camp Forrest. He had twice survived the deadliest flu in history and lived to write home about it.  After his second recovery his concerns turned to getting back to Chicago by Christmas. \"Clif I have seen my discharge all written out and from that moment on my usefulness as a soldier ceased.\"  But again illness got in the way. This time it was a completely different one: \"Measles has broken out in our company and we are quarantined. Did you ever hear of harder luck in all your life?\"  Culhane didn't make it back to Chicago for Christmas. But he eventually did return home alive and well.  He never did make it to France, but traveled the United States extensively with his wife, Evelyn, a woman never mentioned in his letters home, but someone he'd known since they went through First Holy Communion together.  As for Clif Pinter, who saved the letters, he and Al Culhane remained \"old chums\" for life.  After Pinter's death, his son passed the letters on to Al's daughter, Dorothy Clarke, who passed them onto Al's grandchildren, including Lawrence Aloysius Shaughnessy, who works for CNN's Pentagon unit and occasionally writes stories about soldiers for CNN.com.", "Q": ["Q: what is the pandemic A:", "Q: when did it ravage military camps A:", "Q: who was quarentined A:", "Q: where was the panademic A:", "Q: What did the soldier survive twice?

{"article": "TOKYO, Japan (CNN)  -- Had this custody drama played out in the United States, Christopher Savoie might be considered a hero -- snatching his two little children back from an ex-wife who defied the law and ran off with them.  A Tennessee court awarded Christopher Savoie custody of his son, Isaac, and daughter, Rebecca.  But this story unfolds 7,000 miles away in the Japanese city of Fukuoka, where the U.S. legal system holds no sway.  And here, Savoie sits in jail, charged with the abduction of minors. And his Japanese ex-wife -- a fugitive in the United States for taking his children from Tennessee -- is considered the victim.  \"Japan is an important partner and friend of the U.S., but on this issue, our points of view differ,\" the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo said Tuesday. \"Our two nations approach divorce and child-rearing differently. Parental child abduction is not considered a crime in Japan.\"  The story begins in the Nashville suburb of Franklin, Tennessee, with the January divorce of Savoie from his first wife, Noriko, a Japanese native. The ex-wife had agreed to live in Franklin to be close to the children, taking them to Japan for summer vacations.  Savoie in March requested a restraining order to prevent his ex-wife from taking the children to Japan, saying she had threatened to do so, according to court documents obtained by CNN affiliate WTVF and posted on the station's Web site. A temporary order was issued, but then lifted following a hearing.  \"If Mother fails to return to Tennessee [after summer vacation] with the children following her visitation period, she could lose her alimony, child support and education fund, which is added assurance to Father that she is going to return with the children,\" Circuit Court Judge James G. Martin III noted in his order on the matter.  After that ruling, Christopher Savoie tried to have Martin recuse himself, as he was a mediator in the case prior to becoming a judge, said Marlene Eskind Moses, Noriko Savoie's attorney. But that request was denied, as Savoie earlier said he had no concerns about Martin hearing the matter.  Following the summer trip, Noriko Savoie did return to the United States, and Christopher Savoie then took the children on a vacation, returning them to his ex-wife, his attorney, Paul Bruno, told CNN.  Watch latest report on Savoie's situation \u00bb  But days later, on the first day of classes for 8-year-old Isaac and 6-year-old Rebecca, the school called Savoie to say his children hadn't arrived, Bruno said. Police checked Noriko Savoie's home and did not find the children.  Concerned, Savoie called his ex-wife's father in Japan, who told him not to worry.  \"I said, 'What do you mean -- don't worry? They weren't at school.' 'Oh, don't worry, they are here,' \" Savoie recounted the conversation to CNN affiliate WTVF earlier this month. \"I said, 'They are what, they are what, they are in Japan?' \"  The very thing that Savoie had predicted in court papers had happened -- his wife had taken their children to Japan and showed no signs of returning, Bruno said.  After Noriko Savoie took the children to Japan, Savoie filed for and received full custody of the children, Bruno said. And Franklin police issued an arrest warrant for his ex-wife, the television station reported.  But there was a major hitch: Japan is not a party to the 1980 Hague Convention on international child abduction. The international agreement standardizes laws, but only among participating countries.  So while Japanese civil law stresses that courts resolve custody issues based on the best interest of the children without regard to either parent's nationality, foreign parents have had little success in regaining custody.  Japanese family law follows a tradition of sole custody divorces. When a couple splits, one parent typically makes a complete and lifelong break from the children.  In court documents filed in May, Noriko Savoie denied that she was failing to abide by the terms of the couple's court-approved parenting plan or ignoring court-appointed parent coordinators. She added she was \"concerned about the stability of Father, his extreme antagonism towards Mother and the effect of this on the children.\"  Noriko Savoie could not be reached by CNN for comment.  Bruno said he helped Christopher Savoie pursue legal remedies to recover the children, working with police, the FBI and the State Department.  \"We tried to do what we could to get the kids back,\" Bruno said. \"There was not a whole lot we can do.\"  \"Our court system failed him,\" said Diane Marshall, a court-appointed parent coordinator who helped Savoie make decisions about the children. \"It's just a mess.\"  But Moses, Noriko Savoie's attorney, told CNN that the children's father had other legal options.  The International Association for Parent-Child Reunion, formed in Japan this year, claims to know of more than 100 cases of children abducted by non-custodial Japanese parents.  And the U.S. State Department says it is not aware of a single case in which a child taken from the United States to Japan has been ordered returned by Japanese courts -- even when the left-behind parent has a U.S. custody decree.  Facing such statistics and the possibility of never seeing his kids again, Savoie took matters into his own hands.  He flew to Fukuoka. And as his ex-wife walked the two children to school Monday morning, Savoie drove alongside them.  He grabbed the kids, forced them into his car, and drove off, said police in Fukuoka.  Watch CNN panel discuss Savoie's legal options \u00bb  He headed for the U.S. consulate in that city to try to obtain passports for Isaac and Rebecca.  But Japanese police, alerted by Savoie's ex-wife, were waiting.  Consulate spokeswoman Tracy Taylor said she heard a scuffle outside the doors of the consulate. She ran up and saw a little girl and a man, whom police were trying to talk to.  Eventually, police took Savoie away, charging him with the abduction of minors -- a charge that carries a jail sentence of up to five years.  Bruno said if the situation were reversed and a Japanese parent had abducted a Japanese child and fled to America, U.S. courts would \"correct that problem, because it's a crime.\"  He said he has \"concerns about Japan... providing a place for people to abduct children and go to. The parent left behind does not have recourse.\" He added, \"the president and his administration should do something to correct this.\"  The consulate met with Savoie on Monday and Tuesday, Taylor said. It has provided him with a list of local lawyers and said it will continue to assist.  Meanwhile, the international diplomacy continues. During the first official talks between the United States and Japan's new government, the issue of parental abductions was raised.  But it is anybody's guess what happens next to Savoie, who sits in a jail cell.

{"article": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- British union leaders will recommend Thursday ending an unofficial strike that has dragged on more than a week at the country's third-largest oil refinery, the arbitrator in the dispute announced Wednesday.  Protesters at the Lindsay Oil Refinery are opposed to plans to employ non-British workers at the plant.  Workers walked off the job January 28 to protest the hiring of hundreds of foreign workers for a construction project at the Lindsey oil refinery in eastern England.  Their action has prompted similar \"wildcat\" strikes, unsanctioned by national unions, at other sites across the country.  The compromise will involve opening 101 new jobs to British workers, the arbitration service ACAS said in a written statement.  Local union leaders had earlier told demonstrators they were near their goal of being offered half the jobs involved in one of the latest subcontracts connected to the construction project -- 102 new jobs for a minimum of nine weeks.  \"If you can't be happy with that, you can't be happy with anything,\" a local union official said at a demonstration televised by Britain's Sky News. The union leader did not identify himself.  The French-based oil company Total, which owns the plant, confirmed a deal was in the cards.  \"Union officials will present details of the agreement to the workforce at 7:30 a.m. (2:30 a.m. ET Thursday) and recommend a return to work,\" Total said in a release.  Stephen Hughes, a Labour legislator in the European Parliament, warned that the reported compromise could itself run afoul of European labor law, opening the way for foreign workers who lose out to British labor to claim they were being discriminated against on the basis of nationality.  Union leaders have been meeting over three days with Total, Jacobs, the main site contractor, and IREM, the Italian firm hired to carry out the project, in talks moderated by ACAS. They had already rejected one proposal, a union official told CNN.  Union leaders accuse Total of discriminating against British workers by subcontracting with IREM, which has hired workers from Italy and Portugal. Total rejects the allegation.  Overall, the construction project has employed, directly or indirectly, 600 to 1,000 workers for about 18 months, Total said.  \"It has never been, and never will be, the policy of Total to discriminate against British companies or British workers. We have been a major local employer for 40 years and the majority of our 500 permanent staff are local,\" the company said in a statement released Monday.  It said IREM had won the sub-contract through a fair and legal bidding process.  ACAS will investigate the bidding process and report within weeks, it said Wednesday.  Hundreds of workers at British power plants and refineries have been walking off the job in unofficial \"wildcat\" strikes since the Lindsey workers put down their tools last Wednesday.  Spontaneous strikes took place Tuesday in every corner of the country: at the Stanlow oil refinery in western England, Drax power station in the northeast, Petroplus Coryton Refinery in the southeast and Longannet power station in Scotland.  A total of nearly 1,000 workers were off the job at the three English locations. Scottish Power did not specify how many workers were on strike.  Representatives of all four plants said contractors, not full-time staff, had walked off the job, and all said operations were not affected.  But resolving the Lindsey strike may not be the end of the matter. Union leaders say the strike there is only a reflection of problems with the way Britain implements European Union employment directives.  Unite, one of the UK's largest unions, called last week for a national protest in London. The country's main labor groups have all issued statements in support of the striking workers.  \"The government is failing to grasp the fundamental issues. The problem is not workers from other European countries working in the UK, nor is it about foreign contractors winning contracts in the UK. The problem is that employers are excluding UK workers from even applying for work on these contracts,\" Unite General Secretary Derek Simpson said Tuesday.  \"No European worker should be barred from applying for a British job and absolutely no British worker should be barred from applying for a British job.\"  The dispute has reverberated up to the highest levels of government, with the prime minister and the leader of the opposition trading barbs about it in Parliament on Wednesday.  Prime Minister Gordon Brown said he hoped workers would accept the ACAS-moderated deal despite their \"reservations.\"  Brown also rejected accusations by Conservative leader David Cameron that his use of the slogan \"British jobs for British workers\" in a 2007 speech had pandered to \"protectionist fears.\"  \"Can anybody here say that they don't want British workers to get jobs in our country?\" Brown retorted in the House of Commons.", "Q": ["Q: What deal has been agreed?

{"article": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Barack Obama's victory Tuesday over John McCain capped an unprecedented rise in American politics.  Barack Obama, addressing supporters after his victory, was an unlikely nominee not that long ago.

Election Day showed that, in this case at least, you can believe the hype. But Obama did not win the White House on hype, any more than he won it on hope.  He won it with an organization that even opponents called brilliant. He won it with a clear strategy that was stuck to with remarkably little internal drama. He won it with unparalleled fundraising and an overwhelming ground game. And he won it after facing various challenges and turning them to his advantage.  Turning points  Winning Iowa: Obama's victory in the Iowa caucuses knocked almost all of his Democratic competitors out in the first nominating contest, and it pushed the \"inevitable\" Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, back on her heels. He'd built an organization strong enough to haul supporters out of their homes on a frigid January night to debate, harangue and cajole their neighbors into backing him. Tens of thousands of new voters became the key to his Iowa win and revealed the outline of a general election plan: Create a wide coalition to bring new voters to the polls in record numbers.  Ted Kennedy: Within weeks of Iowa, all of Obama's Democratic competitors had dropped out of the race except for Clinton, who split the races with him in the run-up to Super Tuesday. It was then that Ted Kennedy, head of the only Democratic family to outrank the Clintons, came out for Obama, comparing the Illinois senator to his assassinated brother, President John F. Kennedy. The move was deeply symbolic, not just for the public but also the party. The Obama-Clinton battle then hinged on who could sway more superdelegates -- the party leaders who could decide the winner if the primary voters could not -- and few superdelegates had the stature of Ted Kennedy.  Addressing race: Race was always going to be a factor in Obama's campaign, even if he hoped his candidacy would transcend it. Clips of the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, his longtime pastor, making hateful remarks hit the Internet and television and put Obama on defense. He responded with a speech in March hailed by commentators as among the most thoughtful ever delivered on race by an American politician. When Wright went further, so did Obama -- condemning him outright and later quitting his church. All this time, black voters were rallying behind Obama, switching their allegiance from Clinton in such large numbers that party elders, such as civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis of Georgia, had to do the same.  Fundraising: Flush with cash from a nationwide network of small and large contributors, Obama announced in June he would opt out of public financing -- the first presidential candidate to pay for his campaign with donations rather than government money since the system began in 1976. McCain hammered Obama for reneging on a promise to stick with public financing, but the issue failed to resonate with voters. Obama kept raising and spending record amounts of money, using it to send staff across the country -- even to dozens of states Democrats hadn't won in years -- and to swamp the airwaves with advertising.  Working with Clinton: The long and bitter primary battle turned many Clinton supporters off Obama. A CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll a month after Obama sealed the nomination found that nearly 50 percent of Clinton's supporters did not plan to vote for Obama in November. McCain tried to exploit the Democrats' divisions and attract Clinton supporters to his side, but the former rivals came together to stop that. Obama and Clinton worked behind the scenes to create a show of public unity, epitomized by Clinton dramatically marching onto the convention floor in Denver to call for the party to nominate Obama by acclamation.  The debates: Obama won all three debates in the eyes of the public, polling for CNN suggested, even if he came up with few, if any, memorable promises or knockout blows. The debates showed the classic Obama -- thoughtful, deliberate and steady. Critically, Obama made no gaffes, rounding out a campaign that was remarkably free of them.  Barack Obama may have looked an unlikely candidate and an even unlikelier victor only a year ago. But his campaign had a different look. It started small but with big ideas and worked, inexorably, to make them reality. Like any candidate, Obama faced challenges, but he always seemed to take the path that would make him stronger. And, by the end, the campaign and the support was so large, so well organized and so powerful that nothing could prevent Obama's march to victory.

{"article": " -- Sen. John McCain's campaign rebuked Sen. Joe Biden on Tuesday, saying the Democratic vice presidential nominee had \"sunk to a new low\" by raising a debate over who cares more for special needs children.  Sen. Joseph Biden embraces a supporter during a campaign stop in Columbia, Missouri, on Tuesday.  The Republican camp's sharp response came after Biden said GOP advocates for children with birth defects should support stem cell research.  During a campaign event in Columbia, Missouri, Biden did not mention his Republican counterpart by name but said, \"I hear all this talk about how the Republicans are going to work in dealing with parents who have both the joy... and the difficulty of raising a child who has a developmental disability, who were born with a birth defect.\"  Biden's support of stem cell research is at odds with the position taken by the Republicans' vice presidential nominee, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, whose 5-month-old son, Trig, has Down syndrome.  Palin, an evangelical Christian, opposes stem cell research because it involves the use of human embryos, but her running mate, GOP presidential nominee McCain, does support stem cell research.  \"Well, guess what, folks? If you care about it, why don't you support stem cell research?\" asked Biden, the running mate of Democratic presidential nominee Sen. Barack Obama.  Those comments brought a sharp response.  \"Barack Obama's running mate sunk to a new low today, launching an offensive debate over who cares more about special needs children,\" McCain-Palin spokesman Ben Porritt said. \"Playing politics with this issue is disturbing and indicative of a desperate campaign.\"  Biden spokesman David Wade insisted that the Delaware senator's comments were not directed at Palin.  \"This is a clash of policies, not a clash of personalities,\" Wade said. \"We've heard not a dime's worth of difference between the McCain-Palin ticket and the Bush administration on medical breakthroughs that millions of parents and doctors believe could save lives and transform the quality of life for countless Americans.\"  During her acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention last week, Palin told parents of children with disabilities that she would be \"a friend and advocate in the White House.\"  But the Alaska governor's support for the disabled has come under scrutiny since McCain chose Palin to be his running mate nearly two weeks ago.  Before her run for the vice presidency, advocacy for special needs programs had not been a central part of her political campaigns or during her administration, despite her sister's autistic son.  Watch more on Palin's budget priorities \u00bb  Palin signed a bill this year increasing special needs funding but frustrated some of the bill's co-sponsors by stepping in only at the last minute.  Sonya Kerr, an Anchorage attorney specializing in disability rights, filed a lawsuit against the state and Palin, alleging that there are not enough services for kids with special needs, specifically a child with autism.  \"I would say, welcome, Gov. Palin, to our reality and what we've been trying to deal with for a long time,\" Kerr said. \"I hope that it means that there will be support on a bipartisan basis for what people with disabilities need so we are not a bargaining chip in the political process.\"  CNN's Deb Feyerick, Alexander Mooney and Rachel Streitfeld contributed to this report.", "Q": ["Q: What comments were a new low?

{"article": "(AOL Autos) -- The conventional wisdom, among most folks, anyway, is that buying a used car is usually something done out of necessity, by those on a budget -- that is, people who want, or need, to \"move down\" from the new-car market because a new model is simply out of their reach.  Bottom line, the Lexus reputation is for high-end luxury, quality and long-term dependability.  However, there is another category of used cars that appeal to those with a bit more disposable income: used luxury cars.  For some buyers, the used-luxury market is a way of getting into that Lexus, Lincoln, Infiniti or Porsche you always wanted, without laying out $70,000 or $80,000 for something you're not actually going to live in.  For others, scouring the used-luxury-car listings is a way of re-visiting the halcyon years of their youth. At this point, some of these used-luxe models have been around so long that they almost qualify as vintage throwback editions.  Recently, Consumer Reports magazine issued its list of best and worst used cars, and divvied them up by price range. Using CR's recommendations as a guideline, here is a list of some of the best used luxury cars currently on the market in the $24,000-30,000 price range.  2005 & 2006 Acura MDX  A luxury SUV, the MDX is spacious, seats seven, and boasts distinctive styling and Acura's famed attention to detail. Plus, it packs some punch under the hood -- this generation was powered by 3.5-liter, 253-hp V6 matched to a five-speed automatic transmission. AOL Autos: Used Acura  Priced just right as a new vehicle, it included safety features like dual-stage front airbags, three-point seatbelts and adjustable head restraints for all seating positions.  2007 Acura RDX  A crossover vehicle that mixes sedan-like ride with SUV roominess, the '07 RDX offered unibody construction, leather upholstery, heated front seats, power moonroof, 18-inch alloy wheels with all-season tires, xenon HID headlights with foglamps and the 2.3-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine -- plus a five-speed automatic transmission with paddle shifters on the steering wheel, and the patented SH-AWD (SH for Super Handling) system.  2006 & 2007 Acura TL  A mid-size, front-wheel-drive, four-door sedan powered by a 258-hp 3.2-liter V6, the Acura TL is a fine road machine. Actually, it was available for '06-'07 as both a TL and a higher-end TL Type S -- the latter of which sported an upgraded engine, a 286-hp 3.5-liter. Depending on trim level, you can find it with a five-speed automatic with a console-mounted lever or shift paddles on the steering wheel.  2007 Audi A3  Audi designers have always shown a certain flair for dynamics, and that is evident here, in a sharply-engineered, handsomely-appointed vehicle that offers a fine balance between silky ride, nimble handling and zesty performance.  This sporty compact was powered by a 200-hp 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine in '07, and came standard with a six-speed manual and an optional Direct Shift Gearbox. AOL Autos: Used Audi  2005 & 2006 BMW 3-Series  The 3-Series is another winning stable of cars, but Consumer Reports especially liked specific model years/versions/features in the 3-Series family: The 2005 RWD coupe and convertible; the '06 325i RWD sedan; the '06 330i RWD sedan and the '05 Z4. Depending on the model year and version, the standard engine ranged from a 184-hp 2.5-L to a 255-hp 3.0-L. AOL Autos: Used BMW  2005 & 2006 Infiniti FX35  Another of the many crossovers that have hit the market the last several years, the FX35 is one of the sportier editions. During these model years, the FX35 2WD came with a 280-hp 3.5-liter V6 and a five-speed automatic transmission. Rear-wheel-drive was standard, but AWD was also an option.  Some spiffier features included leather seating surfaces, 18-inch wheels, dual-zone climate control with microfiltration and steering-wheel controls. AOL Autos: Used Infiniti  Infiniti G35  The G35 is one of the more svelte sports-sedan beauties on the road, offering Infiniti's typical attention to detail and sporting attitude. Yes, it has four doors, but it handles like a sporty coupe, with its power coming from a finely-tuned 3.5-liter V6. Horsepower output is 280 for the automatic and 298 with the manual.  Luxo amenities include leather upholstery, automatic climate control, steering wheel audio controls, illuminated visor vanity mirrors and high-intensity discharge (HID) xenon headlamps.  Lexus  Any luxury-car aficionado knows that a Lexus is one of the most exquisitely-designed, high-performing chariots on the luxury-car market, and CR saw fit to include more than a half-dozen Lexus models on this list of recommended used luxury cars -- from the '02 SC and LX models, to the '03-'04 GX edition, '03 LS, '04 / '06 IS entries, '04-'05 RX model, '05 GS and '06 ES to... well, you get the picture.  Bottom line, given the Lexus reputation for high-end luxury, quality and long-term dependability, it's hard to go wrong with any of the above-named Lexus entries. And all have plenty of engine oomph and luxo-line amenities. AOL Autos: Used Lexus  2007 Lincoln MKX  This luxury crossover vehicle debuted in '07 as a replacement for the Aviator, and made a big splash. A higher-end and pricier version of the Ford Edge, it seats five and is powered by a 265 hp 3.5-liter V-6 and comes with standard six-speed automatic tranny. Either FWD or AWD is available. One cool option was the glass-paneled roof dubbed the \"Vista Roof.\"  2007 Lincoln MKZ  Also new for the '07 model year, this handsome and fully-loaded mid-size luxury sedan replaced the Zephyr. Under the hood purrs a muscular 263-hp V6 hitched to a six-speed automatic transmission. FWD is standard, but AWD is optional. Standard safety features include side-impact air bags in the front; curtain-style head protection airbags for all outboard positions; plus traction control and antilock brakes with electronic brake-force distribution.  2007 Lincoln Town Car  A venerated luxury car whose heritage goes way back, the Town Car still \"has game\" -- and is a far cry from the floaty boats your granddad drove in the '70s and '80s. It's still cavernous inside, but now boasts a much more refined design. It seats six comfortably and is powered by a 239-hp 4.6-liter V-8 that's linked to a four-speed automatic. The well-appointed cabin is trimmed in premium leather and burl walnut appliques. Available in Signature, Signature Limited, Designer and Signature L trim levels, you can find one to fit any taste.  1998 Porsche 911  No, your eyes don't deceive you -- CR did include a primo, high-line vehicle like a Porsche 911 on its list of recommended used cars under $30,000. But, take note: This is the 1998 edition. But when you're dealing with quality of this level, even an 10-year-old vehicle has a lot of juice left in it.  So, by \"going vintage,\" driving enthusiasts can get into their car of their dreams without breaking the bank. In '98, the 911 was powered by a 3.6L H-6 282 hp engine. So, while it wasn't quite the road-burner it is today, is still packed plenty of thrust.  2007 Volvo S60 (FWD)  Only a year old, the '07 used edition should still be in fine condition, and it boasts top-drawer performance, stylish design and Volvo's all-world safety features. The '07 S60 came in several trim levels, with an array of engine sizes, from the turbocharged 2.5-liter 208 hp job to the 2.3-liter 257-hp inline five-cylinder plant to the 2.5-liter high-pressure turbocharged and intercooled engine that churned out 300 ponies. Depending on the trim line, either a manual or automatic transmission can be had.  2006 & 2007 Volvo XC70  The XC70 is a crossover vehicle, splitting the difference between an SUV and a wagon. And it's one of the finest crossovers on the road. It's all-wheel drive, and the latest used-model-year, the '07, was powered by a 208-hp turbocharged 2.5-liter inline-five-cylinder engine matched to a Geartronic five-speed automatic transmission that also offers manual gear selection.", "Q": ["Q: What was the worst used car?

{"article": " -- An Irish bishop resigned amid a Catholic church sex abuse scandal, apologizing in a statement Wednesday for any abuse that occurred in his diocese.  Bishop John Magee of the diocese of Cloyne said he tendered his resignation to Pope Benedict XVI on March 9.  \"I have been informed today that it has been accepted, and as I depart, I want to offer once again my sincere apologies to any person who has been abused by any priest of the Diocese of Cloyne during my time as bishop or at any time,\" Magee said in a statement posted on the diocese Web site.  \"To those whom I have failed in any way, or through any omission of mine have made suffer, I beg forgiveness and pardon.\"  Child abuse by Catholic clergy in Ireland has become such a widespread scandal that the pope addressed it in an unprecedented pastoral letter to Irish Catholics.  Benedict said he was \"truly sorry\" for the abuse. The pope addressed the crisis that has rocked the Irish Catholic Church in an 18-page pastoral letter, which was made public Saturday.  Critics said the pope did not go far enough in the letter.  The acceptance of Magee's resignation came only days after the pope's letter was published.  The leader of Ireland's Roman Catholics, Cardinal Sean Brady, wished Magee well in a statement, but said he had to focus on the victims of abuse.  \"Foremost in my thoughts in these days are those who have suffered abuse by clergy and those who feel angry and let down by the often inadequate response of leaders in the Church,\" said Brady, who has himself come under fire for failing to report what he learned during an investigation into a priest who became one of Ireland's most notorious child abusers.  Brady was part of an internal Church investigation into Father Brendan Smyth in 1975. He did not report his findings to the police and asked two teenagers who gave him evidence to sign oaths of secrecy.  In the past five years, Ireland's Catholic Church has had three separate outside investigations into child abuse -- both sexual and physical -- by priests, nuns, and staff at Catholic-run institutions such as schools and orphanages.  Four bishops tendered their resignations in the wake of the most recent, the Murphy Report, which found a widespread tendency to cover up child abuse in the archdiocese of Dublin between 1975 and 2004.  Only one of those resignations has been accepted -- that of Bishop Donal Murray on December 17.  The resignation of Bishop Magee is not related to any of the recent statutory reports, said Patsy McGarry, religious affairs correspondent for the Irish Times newspaper.  Instead, it is rooted in an internal church report on child protection practices in his Cloyne diocese in southern Ireland.  In 2008 the Catholic Church's own child protection watchdog, the National Board for Safeguarding Children in the Catholic Church in Ireland conducted an audit of child protection practices in every diocese in Ireland, McGarry explained.  It found those to be \"inadequate, and in some respects dangerous\" in Cloyne diocese.  Its findings were published in December 2008, prompting calls for Magee to resign.  Magee did not resign, but he was effectively stripped of his authority in March 2009, when Archbishop Dermot Clifford of the neighboring diocese of Cashel and Emly was appointed \"apostolic administrator\" of Cloyne diocese.  The Murphy Commission -- which produced the report into the Dublin archdiocese -- is now investigating Cloyne diocese, McGarry said. It is expected to report later this year.  Magee, 73, had been bishop of Cloyne since March 1987, according to the Irish Catholic Bishops Conference. Bishops normally retire at 75.

{"article": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- One revolutionized women's hair in the 1960s. Another brought fear to Middle Earth. Another is a champion golfer who now designs courses all over the world.  Christopher Lee is famous for playing Count Dracula and his roles in \"Lord of the Rings\" and \"Star Wars\" films.  Vidal Sassoon, Christopher Lee and Nick Faldo are among those recognized this year on Queen Elizabeth's birthday honors list.  Lee and Faldo will both receive knighthoods, meaning they can now be known as \"Sir Christopher\" and \"Sir Nick.\"  Lee, 87, is famous for his portrayal of dark villains, starting with Count Dracula in a series of movies from the late 1950s until the 1970s. He gained a new generation of fans in in the past decade through is role as the bad wizard Saruman the White in the the \"Lord of the Rings\" trilogy, and as the evil Count Dooku in two \"Star Wars\" prequels.  World-famous golfer Nick Faldo holds six major championship titles -- three from the British Open and three from the Masters. He has the record for the longest streak of majors played -- 48 -- dating to the 1987 British Open, according to the PGA Tour.  Faldo is now almost as famous for designing golf courses as he is for playing the sport. He also serves as a television commentator.  A knighthood is the highest honor, and recipients may use the title \"Sir\" before their names. The equivalent for women is to be awarded the title of \"Dame.\" They recognize a \"pre-eminent contribution\" in any field.  Next come CBEs, or Commanders of the Order of the British Empire, which recognize contribution to a slightly lesser degree. Recipients may not use the title of sir or dame but may use the initials after their names.  Sassoon will be awarded a CBE for his services to the British hairdressing industry. It recognizes a lifetime of achievement for Sassoon, who as a young boy spent years in a London orphanage after his father left and his mother could not afford to care for him.  Later, after his mother dreamed of her son being in a barber shop, she apprenticed him to a local barber. That began a career that saw him develop two classic hairstyles of the Sixties -- the Bob and the even shorter Five-Point Cut -- along with an eponymous hair care line, range of hair care tools, and chain of salons.  Also receiving a CBE is Jonathan Pryce, a Golden Globe-nominated actor who has had roles in the \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" movies, \"Ronin,\" and the James Bond film \"Tomorrow Never Dies.\" He won a best actor award in 1995 at Cannes for his part in the movie \"Carrington.\"  Actor Alan Cumming will receive an OBE, or Order of the British Empire, awarded for notable achievement in any field. He was recognized for \"services to film, theater and the arts and to activism for equal rights for the gay and lesbian community.\"  A large number of artists and others in creative fields are featured on this year's list.  Andrew Motion, who was Britain's poet laureate until he stepped down this year, will receive a knighthood, and several names in fashion will also receive awards.  Fashion designer Jeff Banks will receive a CBE; Frances Marie Corner, the head of the London College of Fashion, will receive an OBE; and MBEs will go to Christopher Bailey, the creative director at Burberry, and Natalie Massenet, the founder of online designer shopping site Net-a-Porter.

{"article": "SEOUL, South Korea (CNN) -- Kim Jong Un issued his first military orders as leader of North Korea just before the death of his father was announced, a South Korean state-run news agency said Wednesday.  Citing \"a South Korean source,\" Yonhap reported that Kim \"ordered all military units to halt field exercises and training and return to their bases.\"  The source called it a sign that Kim Jong Il's son, believed to be in his late 20s, had taken \"complete control over the military,\" Yonhap reported.  An intelligence official said North Korea may be trying to prevent attempted defections as the country goes through a tumultuous transition, the report said.  In Seoul, questions have been raised over why South Korean intelligence was apparently unaware of Kim Jong Il's death until the official announcement.  Both Won Sei Hoon, who heads South Korea's National Intelligence Service, and Defense Minister Kim Kwan Jim \"came under fire\" after admitting they learned of the death from TV news coverage, Yonhap reported.  Just over the border in Dandong, China, CNN spoke with a defector who was scared of North Korean spies watching him.  \"North Koreans don't speak openly,\" the man said. \"If anyone knows I'm talking, I would be sent to prison and there's no mercy there. I would be shot dead.\"  He painted a grim picture of life in North Korea, where he said people are starving, aid is scarce, and the only operating factories serve the military.  \"Pig feed, that's all we can eat,\" he says, adding, \"There is no food, not even food from China. It's been blocked for three years.\"  His son and daughter remain inside North Korea. He crosses back and forth every six months to keep his family alive.  He told CNN he fears a desperate country with a potential power vacuum that could lash out.  Before Kim Jong Il died, \"he was preparing the country for war and death, and to hand power to Kim Jong Un,\" the man said.  Other North Koreans in Dandong were openly weeping over the death of their \"dear leader,\" as he was called in his country.  North Korean state-run news agency KCNA, meanwhile, carried messages praising Kim Jong Il. The top story on the agency's English language website Wednesday, dated Tuesday, said Kim Jong Il \"dedicated himself to the happiness of the people all his life.\"  \"He had a noble wish,\" the KCNA report said. \"It was to bring the greatest happiness and honor to the people even if he had plucked a star from the sky and grown flowers even on a rock.\"  CNN's Stan Grant, Chi Chi Zhang, and Josh Levs contributed to this report.", "Q": ["Q: Who issued military orders before his father's death?

It seems an unlikely musical style for the Pittsburgh native to pursue. Enka's fan based comes generally from an older generation and is practically unknown outside of Japan, with simple song themes about love and loss.  But Jero, real name Jerome White, with his youth, hip-hop look and fine singing voice has propelled enka into the 21st century and captured a new audience.  It was the influence of his Japanese grandmother that first led him on the path to enka. She ensured that Jero was aware of his connection to the culture of Japan and sang enka songs in Japanese with him when he was young.  He went on to study Japanese at high school and spent time in Japan while on an exchange with the University of Pittsburgh.  After he graduated he moved to Japan, working as a computer scientist and teaching English. His big break came when he appeared on an amateur singer TV show.  On the back of that success he released his first single in early 2008, promoting it with live appearances in record stores and the odd impromptu street performances.  It shot up the Japanese singles chart, reaching No 4, the highest ever position for a first time enka release.

{"article": " -- Golfer Tiger Woods Tuesday addressed a racially-tinged remark made by his former caddy, telling reporters Steve Williams apologized and is not a racist.  \"It was a wrong thing to say, something that we both acknowledge,\" Woods said, speaking at the Lakes Golf Club in Sydney, site of this week's Australian Open, according to his website.  Woods and Williams met earlier in the day, and shook hands after Williams apologized, the website reported.  Williams -- who was fired by Woods in July -- was being presented with a satirical award Friday night at an awards dinner in Shanghai, China, for comments he made after his new boss, golfer Adam Scott, defeated Woods at the Bridgestone Invitational in Ohio in August.  Should Williams be punished for his remarks?  According to media reports, when asked about those comments during his acceptance speech Friday night, Williams said: \"I wanted to shove it up that black a--.\"  Shortly afterward, the New Zealander issued a contrite statement on his website.  \"I apologize for comments I made last night at the Annual Caddy Awards dinner in Shanghai,\" the statement said. \"Players and caddies look forward to this evening all year and the spirit is always joking and fun.  \"I now realize how my comments could be construed as racist,\" Williams' statement said. \"However I assure you that was not my intent. I sincerely apologize to Tiger and anyone else I have offended.\"  Woods said Tuesday that Williams \"did apologize. It was hurtful, certainly, but life goes forward.\"  But he said he does not believe Williams is a racist. \"There's no doubt about that,\" Woods said, according to his website. \"It was a comment that shouldn't have been made and certainly one that he wished he didn't make.\"  Both the PGA Tour and the European Tour condemned Williams' comment, but he will not face sanctions.  Scott said earlier he had discussed the matter with Williams and accepted his apology. \"There is absolutely no room for racial discrimination in any walk of life, including the game of golf,\" Scott said, according to the article on Woods' website.  Williams said in July he was shocked and disappointed that Woods had severed their 12-year relationship, especially after he remained loyal to the golfer during the sex scandal in which he was embroiled for several months.  \"Given the fact of my loyalty and the way that I stood by this guy through thick and thin...\" Williams told CNN affiliate Mediaworks in New Zealand at the time. \"And the timing of it is very poor, from my perspective.\"  Williams said the sex scandal had caused him to lose respect for Woods.  \"Well, I think when you're great friends with somebody and a situation like this occurs, you obviously lose some kind of respect,\" Williams said.  In announcing he would no longer be working with Williams, Woods said it was \"time for a change.\"  \"Stevie is an outstanding caddy and a friend, and has been instrumental in many of my accomplishments,\" Woods said in July. \"I wish him great success in the future.\"", "Q": ["Q: Who did Woods play?

{"article": " -- Inter Milan have won the Italian Serie A title for a fifth successive season -- and the 18th time in their illustrious history -- after Diego Milito's goal gave them a 1-0 win at Siena on Sunday.  Jose Mourinho's side needed nothing less than a victory to secure the Scudetto and they achieved that feat in the 57th-minute when striker Milito collected a pass from fellow-Argentine Javier Zanetti, before firing home a shot with the outside of his right foot.  A draw would have allowed second-placed Roma to snatch the title with a win at Chievo and Claudio Ranieri's side kept up their side of the deal with a 2-0 success.  Mirko Vucinic volleyed home Daniele De Rossi's through-ball in the 39th minute and Italian international De Rossi added a second on the stroke of half-time with a superb long-range strike.  With only 45 minutes remaining of the season, Roma were in pole position to win their first title since 2001 -- but Milito's strike ensured Inter became the first team since Juventus in the 1930's to win five titles on the bounce.  The result, which condemned Siena to relegation to Serie B alongside Atalanta and Livorno, also means Inter Milan will now face Bayern Munich in next weekend's Champions League final in Madrid with both sides bidding for a unique treble.  \"This is an incredible joy, a reward for all the hard work we've put in over the year,\" Milito told reporters. \"From tomorrow we will think about that great Champions Lague final.\"  Like the Bavarian giants, Inter have now added the league title to their domestic cup triumph -- and Saturday's Bernabeu showdown now ensures one of the two teams will secure a rare treble of trophies this season.  For Mourinho, who has overseen Inter's last two Scudetto wins, there is the added incentive of joining a select band of coaches to have won the Champions League with two different clubs, following his success with Porto in 2004.", "Q": ["Q: How many years did he win the title?

{"article": "SODDY-DAISY, Tennessee (CNN) -- Kat Koonce loves her Saturns. She owns three, and has pictures of them on Saturnfans.com, where she is one of almost 2,500 Saturn devotees who've posted photo albums of their vehicles.  Saturn owners show off their Sky roadsters after a Christmas parade in Soddy-Daisy, Tennessee, on Sunday.  Judy Pearson shows off a photo album of her Saturn Sky roadster the way a grandmother might show off one of her grandchildren -- pictures of vacations and happy times together.  The women are exactly the kind of customers General Motors was looking for when it introduced the Saturn brand two decades ago as \"a different kind of car company.\" The brand's slogan is now one word -- \"rethink\" -- but its fate may soon be summed up in another -- \"done.\"  General Motors has raised the prospect of eliminating the nameplate as it tries to restructure to regain profitability.  \"I just can't stand the thought of them doing away with Saturn,\" said Dianne Pollard of Hixson, Tennessee. She created the Sky Club of Chattanooga, dedicated to the sporty two-seater.  General Motors hasn't officially announced the end of Saturn, but in a restructuring plan submitted to Congress, the automaker said it would concentrate resources on four core brands -- Chevrolet, Cadillac, Buick and GMC.  That leaves Saturn, along with GM's Pontiac, Saab and Hummer brands, with a dim future.  See how Saturn owners are devoted to their vehicles \u00c2\u00bb  Pollard drove her black 2008 RedLine (that's Saturn's name for a turbo) Sky in Sunday's Christmas parade in Soddy-Daisy, Tennessee, northeast of Chattanooga. Fellow Hixson residents and Sky devotees Connie Terrell (red 2007 RedLine) and Pearson (dark blue 2007 standard edition) were there, too.  All three have owned other, more sedate Saturns than the Sky, which Edmunds.com praises for \"sharp styling, low price and everyday comfort\" and Car and Driver.com calls a \"mini-Corvette\" at around half the price.  They were joined by George and Brenda Holloway, who drove their 2007 Sky almost 100 miles from their farm in Centre, Alabama, to join in the parade.  \"We thoroughly enjoy the Saturn. Our next vehicle, when we buy one, will be a Saturn,\" Brenda Holloway said.  \"This is the only car I've ever owned that you can be driving down the interstate and people pull up beside you and take a picture of it,\" her husband, a retired 20-year Army veteran, said with amusement-tinged pride.  But it's not just the cars -- including the original S series sedans and coupes -- that turn people into \"Saturnistas\"; it's also the pleasant buying experience and over-the-top customer service.  \"It's a family. It's the Saturn family. And you become part of that family,\" Pearson said.  All three Sky owners from Hixson had stories to tell about a sales consultant who went the extra mile or a service call that exceeded their expectations. Pearson said she has owned many makes of cars, including foreign nameplates, and Saturn's treatment of customers beats them all.  \"The best experience I've ever had was with Saturn, bar none,\" she said.  Koonce, of Dayton, Ohio, used to feel that way, too.  But Koonce now says GM might as well kill off the brand, because that would be preferable to the slow death she sees as inevitable.  Saturn sold slightly more than 8,000 cars in November and has delivered about 175,000 this year. That's a far cry from the half a million GM had hoped to sell each year when it introduced Saturn.  Koonce said she fell in love with Saturn before she was old enough to drive. She became such a familiar figure at her local Saturn dealer and so knowledgeable about its lineup that she was hired as a sales consultant.  She and her husband, Nick, met at a Saturn owners' event, their wedding was a Saturn owners' event, and they have owned six Saturns between them. They have brought numerous relatives and friends \"into the Saturn cult,\" said Nick, whose dream is to own a Saturn dealership.  Saturn was conceived in the early 1980s as a separate-standing division of GM, with then-unheard-of features:  \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 an innovative new plant in Spring Hill, Tennessee;  \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 a separate agreement with the United Auto Workers that embraced more teamwork between union and management;  \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 the use of plastics instead of metal for many body parts;  \u00e2\u20ac\u00a2 and a highly personalized consumer experience, including no-haggle buying and \"Homecomings,\" a sort of family reunion for Saturn owners at the Spring Hill campus.  The first Saturn came off the Spring Hill assembly line on July 30, 1990.  Unfortunately, Kat Koonce said, GM has abandoned what made Saturn different. The cars are now made of metal, and the models all have twins in other GM divisions. Even the original Spring Hill factory has been converted to build Chevrolets instead of Saturns; the Saturn VUE is built in Mexico.  So disillusioned was Koonce that she quit her job at the Saturn dealership and went back to college.  \"It was a success that became a failure,\" she said.  Walter S. McManus, the head of the Automotive Analysis Division of the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute, says he could see it coming.  \"Brand loyalty is overrated,\" McManus stated flatly. \"It is costly to do all the fuzzies, and Saturn's example is clear that it doesn't pay off for what is essentially an economy-car company. Women especially appreciated the Saturn way, but Honda sells more cars to women, despite having a less female-friendly approach.\"  Don't tell that to Charlie Eickmeyer, who runs the Saturnfans Web site and has posted a \"Save Saturn\" petition for the site's 35,000 members to sign. And don't tell the Sky Club of Chattanooga.  \"I think Saturn really is a different kind of car company, and that is what has brought me back to them,\" Pearson said.", "Q": ["Q: What did the auto industry researcher say?

{"article": " -- Earlier this year, Matt Keller sat down with officials in Afghanistan -- not to discuss troop deployments, suicide bombings or opium traffickers. He was there to talk about getting laptop computers into the hands of little girls.  Girls in India take a seat on the floor and get to work on their new laptops.  As Taliban insurgents continue to crack down on girls who go to school and women who dare to teach them, Keller was awestruck by the Afghan government's determination to educate all children, even if it means finding tools that allow them to intellectually grow in the privacy of their own homes.  \"For them to propose this was astounding,\" said Keller, who works for One Laptop per Child, a Cambridge, Massachusetts, nonprofit committed to creating and distributing affordable, durable and solar-powered laptops to the world's poorest children. \"That hunger for knowledge, that desire to learn, is pretty profound.\"  From Uruguay, Haiti and Mexico to Mongolia, Ghana and the small Polynesian island of Niue, at least 750,000 kids -- a number that will double by June, Chairman Nicholas Negroponte said -- are tapping away on One Laptop per Child-produced XO laptop keyboards.  They're exploring mathematics, composing music and art, learning new languages, designing animation, collecting data, collaborating with peers across borders and accessing learning tools (including textbooks) that they would never see otherwise.  Targeting current and historic conflict zones, including Iraq, Rwanda and most recently the Gaza Strip, not only fulfills the group's mission to offer equal-access education to the most isolated children, it may also promote world peace, Keller said.  By putting laptops \"into the hands of kids who would otherwise be indoctrinated,\" he explained, \"we can make the case pretty successfully that doing this is a long-term solution to root causes.\"  When the laptops, which incorporate free wireless Internet connectivity and open-source programming, first rolled out in 2007, they cost $205 each. Now, they're down to $180.  The price is higher than Negroponte's original goal of $100 a pop, but it's a figure he believes will keep going down as One Laptop per Child finds ways to engineer the product with fewer components.  The hope is that with corporate sponsorships and donations, collected through a program called Give One Get One, the computers can be delivered to kids at no cost to the poorest host-country governments.  The laptops allow students to engage in learning differently, enjoy a customized approach and hone critical thinking skills, explained David Cavallo, One Laptop per Child's vice president of learning. And their mere existence, he said, keeps kids coming to school.  Cavallo spoke of a school in Rwanda that lacks electricity and traditionally had a 50 percent attendance rate. It is now drawing 1,000 more students than its previous full capacity, he said, and is even attracting kids -- who in turn are teaching their parents and grandparents -- on weekends.  \"Rwanda is recovering from genocide,\" he said. This is a \"real engagement of a society directing itself to a different future.\"  And the kids, no matter their previous exposure to technology, immediately gravitate to the machines. Keller, the group's director for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, recalled a visit to rural Ethiopia.  As he passed out the laptops, he kept one eye on the children, the other on his watch. Seven seconds was all it took for an 8-year-old boy to flip open the never-seen-before computer, find and then hit the power button.  Within two weeks, that boy and his classmates would be programming. Meanwhile, the nearby adults stared at the oddball objects and flashed the international look of, \"What the hell is this thing?\" Keller said. \"Kids are technology natives, and adults are technology immigrants.\"  Despite its ongoing successes, the downturn in the economy has taken a toll on the nonprofit. The last Give One Get One promotion brought in $2.5 million, while the first incarnation brought in $37.5 million, Negroponte said. And corporate sponsors fell from 11 to three in the span of 30 days, he added. Early this year, the organization laid off half of its staff, bringing the total on payroll to just 32.  These economic realities, though disappointing, won't impede the mission, said Negroponte, who created One Laptop per Child with others from the MIT Media Lab. Thousands of volunteers around the world offer technical support and training, and serve as translators and programmers.  \"If we could get all the children in the world -- 1.2 billion of them between 6 and 12 -- to have a connected laptop, that would be success,\" Negroponte said. \"Roughly half of those children have no electricity at home or school. The poverty is so extreme, and the environmental conditions are so extreme, we have to focus on them.\"  The push has been to reach out to developing nations, but that hasn't precluded the group from serving American communities that can pursue the program at a scale that makes sense financially.  Birmingham City Schools in Alabama, for example, now has 14,000 of the group's laptops in students' hands.  Michael Wilson, principal of Glen Iris Elementary School in Birmingham, opened his building's doors last year as the district's pilot school for the free laptop program.  \"It's been an overwhelming success at our school,\" which has a poverty rate of 83 percent, Wilson said. Through professional development and a summer camp for kids, the school is learning how to best utilize the computers. And the students, who own their laptops, are learning about responsibility.  They're \"totally engaged in what they're doing,\" Wilson said. \"I have kids getting out of cars in the morning with their laptops open.\"  One of those kids might be Amicah Bitten, a fourth-grader who is using the computer on her own time to learn Spanish with her mother, Kamonia Bates.  \"It gets me more interested because she's interested.... She doesn't put it down,\" said Bates, who used to take her daughter to the library when she needed a computer.  \"I like it because people can learn stuff,\" Amicah, 9, said after school. \"You can listen to music. You can take pictures. You can also learn how to make different things. I can learn Spanish. I can learn French. I can learn how to use the keyboard.... Yes ma'am, my laptop can do many things.\"", "Q": ["Q: Who does One Laptop per Child target? A:", "Q: What may be a challenge? A:", "Q: What can laptops do? A:", "Q: When will they be delivered by?

{"article": "(Mashable) -- Congressman Paul Ryan (R-WI) will not support the Stop Online Piracy Act, according to a statement released by his office Monday.  In the statement, Ryan calls the Internet \"one of the most magnificent expressions of freedom and free enterprise in history\" and says \"it should stay that way.\"  According to Ryan, SOPA is an attempted solution to the \"legitimate problem\" of digital piracy, but the bill \"creates the precedent and possibility for undue regulation, censorship and legal abuse.\"  Congressman Ryan, chairman of the House Budget Committee, became a target of the Reddit community last month. Reddit users considered Ryan's previous stance on SOPA too vague -- and took issue with the $288,600 that the Congressman had accepted from pro-SOPA groups.  Mashable: Fears of SOPA unfounded, bill's sponsor says  Redditors began \"Operation Pull Ryan,\" a grassroots campaign to prevent Ryan's re-election in 2012. The community embraced Ryan's opponent, Rob Zerban, who is running for Congress in November of this year. Zerban returned Reddit's affection, hosting an \"AMA,\" or \"Ask Me Anything,\" where he fielded questions directly from Reddit users.  Zerban credited Reddit with influencing Ryan's decision on SOPA. In a statement posted on the social media site, Zerban said: \"Reddit was able to force the House Budget Chair to reverse course -- shock waves will be felt throughout the establishment in Washington today, and other lawmakers will take notice.\"  Mashable: U.S. wanted a Spanish SOPA  In fact, Reddit may not have had an impact on Ryan's SOPA decision. Paul's position on the bill was unclear until now. As a conservative Republican who favors smaller government, it makes sense that Ryan would oppose a bill which gives more authority to the Federal government.  On the other hand, the bill was introduced by Rep. Lamar Smith, a conservative Republican from Texas, so party labels are not a reliable indicator of SOPA support. Congressman Ryan's office did not immediately respond to a request for a comment.  Is the tide turning against SOPA in Congress? Let us know your thoughts in the comments.

{"article": " -- The 19-year-old woman whose hospitalization exposed a shocking Austrian incest case is recovering well and wants to see the ocean and a pop concert, her doctors and a family lawyer said Wednesday.  Dr. Albert Reiter, who treated Kerstin, is confident Kerstin will make a full recovery in time.  She and other children who were held captive for years are slowly adapting to modern life, they said.  Kerstin Fritzl, whom doctors placed in an artificial coma after she was admitted to a hospital in April for multiple organ failure, is now well enough to speak, stand and walk with assistance, her doctors said.  Doctors said that \"little novelties\" such as seeing a cloud go by are now big events for the former captives.  Kerstin has said she wants to see the ocean and go to a concert by British singer Robbie Williams, said Dr. Berhold Kepplinger, director of the clinic where the family is living.  He described how excited Kerstin was to hear Robbie Williams songs in her hospital room and said she was moving around to the music so much that doctors had to quiet her down.  It was then, Kepplinger said, that doctors became confident Kerstin can become fully healthy and develop normally. Her immune system has improved, and she is continuing to have physiotherapy, including strengthening exercises, he said.  Watch doctors describe what happened when the teen opened her eyes \u00bb  The two parts of her family -- those who were locked in a basement, like Kerstin, and those who lived above ground, apparently unaware of the abuse of their mother and siblings -- are getting to know each other again, the doctors and the family's lawyer said.  \"We are so glad that things have turned out so positively so far,\" said lawyer Christoph Herbst, who appeared at a news conference at a hotel near Amstetten, west of Vienna, where Kerstin and her family are recovering.  Kerstin is the oldest daughter of an incestuous relationship between Elisabeth, 43, and Elisabeth's father, Josef Fritzl, 73, according to police. He is awaiting trial.  Police say he confessed to holding Elisabeth captive since 1984 and raping her repeatedly, fathering seven children with her. Six of the children survived.  Kerstin fell unconscious in April, and Elisabeth convinced her father that she needed urgent medical attention. Kerstin was admitted to a hospital in Amstetten, where staff grew suspicious and called police, who opened an investigation and uncovered the abuse.  Kerstin was suffering from kidney, lung, and liver failure when she arrived at the hospital, said Dr. Albert Reiter, director of the hospital. Doctors were able to turn her health around, but they kept her in a coma with artificial respiration for weeks, he said.  Doctors started reducing Kerstin's medication May 12, allowing her to emerge from the coma, he said. Three days later, she opened her eyes and smiled at her carers, he said, and doctors were soon able to take the breathing tube from her throat.  Her mother was at Kerstin's bedside regularly, and doctors credited that with helping Kerstin's health improve.  On Sunday, Kerstin finally met with other family members and was able to say hello to them, he said. Kerstin and the rest of the family were also able to move into an apartment at a regional clinic nearby.  \"It was a special moment where, walking, we were able to support her and cross the threshold into a new house and into a new life,\" Reiter said.  Kerstin and two of her brothers, ages 18 and 5, had spent their entire lives trapped in the cellar with their mother, never seeing daylight. A television was their only contact with the outside world.  The other three children Josef Fritzl fathered with Elisabeth were taken as infants to live above ground with Fritzl and his wife, who says she had no idea her daughter was being held captive.  In recent weeks, the wife and the three children have had several meetings with Kerstin and the others formerly held in the basement. The doctors said that all are receiving therapy and are getting to know each other.  \"It is clear that [the two sides] have a different temper of life,\" Kepplinger said. \"These different ways of living, the two parts of the family, still have to come to some agreement.\"  Still, the entire family is \"very happy\" to be reunited, Herbst said.  \"This is an incredible drawing-near to each other. There is incredible joy among them,\" he said. \"It is wonderful to see the way they are living together.\"  He appealed to the public and the media to give the family privacy.  There continues to be \"big ambivalence\" about the \"grandfather issue,\" as Kepplinger called it, and therapists are helping the family members cope with the complicated relationship they have with each other and with Fritzl, who is now behind bars.", "Q": ["Q: Who is expected to make a full recovery?

{"article": "ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Tuba Sahaab looks nothing like a warrior. She is a slight girl of 11, living in a simple home in a suburb of Islamabad. But in Tuba's case, looks are deceiving.  \"I want to give peace to my nation,\" Tuba Sahaab says, \"I will fight for it.\"  With her pen, Tuba is taking on the swords of the Taliban. She crafts poems telling of the pain and suffering of children just like her; girls banned from school, their books burned, as the hard-core Islamic militants spread their reign of terror across parts of Pakistan.  A stanza of one of her poems reads: \"Tiny drops of tears, their faces like angels, Washed with blood, they sleep forever with anger.\"  Tuba is not afraid to express her views. Of the Taliban forcing young girls out of the classroom, she says: \"This is very shocking to hear that girls can't go to school, they are taking us back to the Stone Age.\"  Less than two hours from Tuba's home, the Taliban have control. The one-time holiday destination of the Swat Valley is now a no-go zone. Curfews are in place at all times. Militants kill with impunity.  Human rights activists and people on the ground in Swat Valley speak of a place called \"slaughter square\" where the Taliban leave the bodies of their victims with notes saying \"do not remove for 24 hours.\" No one touches the corpses out of fear of reprisals.  Watch Tuba recite her poetry \u00c2\u00bb  Tuba Sahaab refuses to be silent. As young as she is, she is wise and brave beyond her years. The young school girl is reaching a bigger audience, regularly appearing in the media.  On the day we spend with her, Tuba and her mother appear on a talk radio program. Back home, she tells me how she would give her life for her country.  \"I want to give peace to my nation,\" she says, \"I will fight for it.\"  And Tuba has an inspiration: U.S. President Barack Obama.  She prayed for his elections, she says. She sees in him the hope of peace in her own country. Tuba Sahaab has a dream to meet her hero. She can hardly contain her excitement.  \"I want to go the White Palace and show him my poems, show him what is happening and ask him to come to Pakistan and control it because he is a super power.\"  Meeting and listening to Tuba Sahaab, it is easy to forget she is still a young girl.  In her playground at school, Tuba dances and laughs with her friends. She loves writing her short stories (she has already published one book) and shows me a cartoon character she has created called \"Tomato Man.\"  Tuba's parents are proud of their daughter. They say they are not afraid even as she speaks out so publicly against the Taliban.  Tuba is their only child but as her mother tells me, she is \"worth more than seven sons and seven daughters.\"  And Tuba has the dreams of any young child. She tells me she wants to be an astronaut and then one day lead her country.  \"I will do anything, if my life goes I don't worry, I just want to do something.\" \"I think you will get the chance,\" I say.  \"Yes, if someone gives me the chance you will see what I can do.\"  Of that, I have no doubt.", "Q": ["Q: What does Sahaab craft?

{"article": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- An increase in the number of suicides among military personnel can be traced, in part, to a \"stressed and tired force\" made vulnerable by multiple deployments, a military leader said Wednesday.  Long troop deployments in Iraq, above, and Afghanistan have been cited in the rise in military suicides.  \"We must find ways to relieve some of this stress,\" said Gen. Peter W. Chiarelli, vice chief of staff of the Army, in testimony before the Senate Armed Services Military Personnel Subcommittee.  \"I think it is the cumulative effect of deployments from 12 to 15 months,\" he said, adding that the longer deployments are scheduled to continue until June.  He cited long deployments, lengthy separations from family and the perceived stigma associated with seeking help as factors contributing to the suicides.  Adm. Patrick M. Walsh, vice chief of naval operations, said suicides are the third leading cause of death in the Navy.  \"We must eliminate the perceived stigma, shame and dishonor of asking for help,\" he said.  Gen. James F. Amos, assistant commandant of the Marine Corps, said his branch of the service has incorporated education and training about suicide prevention \"at all levels.\"  He said four of 55 mental health professionals deployed in the U.S. Central Command were recently embedded with Marines. He expressed optimism that that tactic would pay off, but he said he had no data to support his expectation.  And Gen. William M. Fraser, vice chief of staff of the Air Force, said his branch, too, was taking steps \"to ensure airmen are as mentally prepared for deployment and redeployment as they are physically and professionally.\"  Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, said the efforts have not sufficed. He noted that last year, for the first time, the suicide rate among military personnel has exceeded that of the civilian population. \"What's going on?\" he asked rhetorically.  The panel members made clear that, whatever is going on, it is complex. Chiarelli said the Army tallied 133 confirmed suicides last year and is still investigating another seven possible ones. At least 70 percent of the suicides had \"some kind of relationship problem,\" he said. Often, the situation was worsened by something else, such as a financial or legal problem, he said.  And it wasn't just the trauma of war that appears to heighten the risk. The suicides were about evenly divided among those who had returned from deployment, those who were still deployed -- some on a third or fourth tour -- and those who had never been deployed, Chiarelli said.  All of the military leaders said they had too few mental health professionals in their ranks.  But Walsh said professionals are not the only people who must be trained to intervene, noting that it is often the shipmate or the battle buddy who seeks assistance for someone in need.  And Navy counselors are now asking family members for feedback that often proves more illuminating than what the sailors themselves are willing to impart, he said.  \"If I survey the family, I'm going to get a different set of answers.\"  One reason some service personnel are reluctant to seek help from their chain of command is because they fear they will then be passed over for promotions, the panel members said.  In some cases, they pay out of their own pockets to seek help privately, Rubenstein said.  And others call civilian hotlines, one of which reported getting three calls per day this year from active-duty military personnel.  Representatives of all of the branches of the military said they have seen recent increases in suicides.  At the Pentagon, Defense Secretary William Gates said he believes the 15-month deployments \"were a real strain\" on many, but expressed optimism that beneficial changes are in the works.  \"All the services are are addressing this problem, but the Army in particular, I think, is really going after it in a very aggressive way,\" he said.  But some suicides appear to defy all prevention efforts. Maj. Gen. David A. Rubenstein, deputy surgeon general of the Army, cited the case of a 33-year-old soldier who was living at home with his wife and three children.  He suffered a traumatic brain injury more than two years ago and had been giving weekly motivational speeches to other soldiers in a clinic.  For the past two years, the soldier also had been seeing a psychiatrist. The most recent visit occurred last Friday.  On Monday, he saw his primary care doctor and his nurse case manager, and also had a life-skills appointment.  \"On Tuesday, he apparently committed suicide,\" Rubenstein said. \"This soldier was treated, compliant and supported in every way, and yet he's dead today.\"  The suicide underscores that suicide is \"a complex, very difficult problem that causes all of us to scratch our heads and wonder: how do we stop the next one?\"  Last year, at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, two cadets and two members of the staff and faculty killed themselves, said Brig. Gen. Michael S. Linnington, commandant of the cadets.  He cited stress from broken relationships and, in one case, a pre-existing mental health condition that academy officials had not known about at the time of admission. None of the four had been deployed to a combat zone.  Linnington called the spate of self-directed violence at the school \"troubling and unacceptable\" and said preventive measures there had been beefed up in recent months.", "Q": ["Q: What is to blame for the suicides?

{"article": "GAZA CITY (CNN) -- A radical Muslim sheikh called Friday for the creation of an Islamic emirate in Gaza, sparking clashes with Hamas forces that left 13 people dead, Hamas sources tell CNN.  Armed members of the radical Islamist group Jund Ansar Allah surround a group representative in Rafah on Friday.  The clashes ended after several hours, after Hamas forces blew up the home of Sheikh Abu al-Nour al-Maqdessi, leader of the Salafist jihadist group Jund Ansar Allah, or Soldiers of the Partisans of God, the sources said.  Al-Maqdessi escaped, they said, and Hamas security forces were searching for him.  The clashes were the latest between Gaza's Hamas rulers, who have said they are moderate Muslims pledged to the Palestinian cause, and more radical Islamic groups.  In a televised statement, Hamas ministry spokesman Taher Nunu called al-Maqdessi's group \"outlaws\" and said they have been \"terrorizing the country and attacking civilians.\"  \"We hold the group and its leader fully responsible for what is happening in Gaza, and we offer our condolences to everyone who was killed during the clashes,\" Nunu said. \"No one is above the law, and we urge everyone who is a member of this group to surrender himself to the authorities, or they will be accountable for all of their actions.\"  The gunfighting erupted near a mosque in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, where the cleric delivered his sermon, the sources said. Hamas militants raided the mosque and seized control of it.  Later, the fighting spread to al-Maqdessi's home, the sources said.  The fighting has left at least 13 dead and more than 100 wounded, the sources said.  Al-Maqdessi also called for a public meeting at the mosque, posting on Jund Ansar Allah's Web site an invitation dubbed \"the golden advice to the government of [Hamas leader] Ismail Haniya.\"  The group posted a statement on the site announcing the establishment of the Islamic emirate in Gaza and proclaiming al-Maqdessi \"the commander of the faithful.\" The statement declared that armed forces in Gaza should unite under him.  The statement urged Muslims everywhere to support the \"young emirate\" and provide the group with money, weapons and men because \"this is the hope of the Muslim nation in raising the banner of monotheism in Palestine and to liberate all the lands and purify Al-Aqsa mosque from the filth of the damned Jews.\"  Al-Aqsa mosque is in Jerusalem.  The group accused Hamas of not being Islamic enough, saying Hamas cares more about pleasing \"tyrants\" than \"obeying God.\"  But Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zahri dismissed statements about the establishment of an Islamic emirate as \"theoretical.\"  \"It is not permitted to any party or individual to enforce their own laws, because this is the responsibility of the security forces,\" he said.  Salafi is the term used to describe the radical islamist movement that follows the doctrines of the \"Salaf,\" or the predecessors, referring to the early generations of Muslims. The movement rejects all modern influences such as politics and government.  CNN's Talal Abu-Rahman in Gaza City contributed to this report.", "Q": ["Q: What mosque was raided?

{"article": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- It was an odd collection of vehicles on display on Capitol Hill, ranging from a bucket truck used for repairing power lines to something resembling an enclosed golf cart to a pair of hot-looking, two-seater sports cars.  Lawmakers eyeball one of several alternative-energy vehicles parked this week on Capitol Hill.  What they had in common was alternative energy: The cars run on electricity and biofuels as well as gasoline. Tuesday's display attracted some U.S. senators who couldn't resist taking the vehicles for a spin.  \"I'm about to have claustrophobia!\" laughed Sen. Thomas Carper, D-Delaware, as he folded himself into a yellow, low-slung vehicle known by the initials ENVI, developed by the Chrysler Corporation.  \"Evan Bayh [Democratic senator from Indiana] and I were talking about taking a road trip in the van down there,\" said Carper, pointing to a nearby offering from General Motors. \"That's probably better for a road trip than this!\"  Carper then spotted Democratic colleague Tom Harkin, and joked that the sports car might draw too much attention in the Iowa senator's corn country.  Undeterred, Harkin climbed in next and asked to take a test drive. But instead of starting with a growling engine and a roar of exhaust, the little yellow coupe simply rolled quietly out of its parking space.  It is an electric vehicle.  The display, titled \"The Energy and Environmental Showcase,\" was intended to demonstrate for lawmakers actual production models of vehicles that may cut the nation's reliance on petroleum-based fuels. An unusual aspect of the show was that traditional Detroit nameplates such as General Motors sat next to competitors from other countries.  The event was organized by Bright Automotive, a small carmaker from Anderson, Indiana, to showcase its IDEA, a new, 100-mpg plug-in hybrid electric vehicle that it hopes to market for government and commercial fleets. In a statement, the company said it has applied for funding through the federal Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing Loan Program.  Other manufacturers took advantage of the opportunity to bring their own vehicles to the public display, in a parking lot near the Russell Senate Office Building.  During the Bush administration, Japanese automakers complained they weren't invited to a similar demonstration near the Treasury Department, despite having brought their alternative-energy cars more swiftly to the U.S. market than the Detroit automakers.  But neither the competition nor the threat of bankruptcy held back the enthusiasm of a General Motors product spokesman at Tuesday's display. \"If anything, it's just a little bit of noise in the background,\" said Tony Posawatz, a GM vehicle line director.  He told CNN the automaker places high on its recovery agenda the line of Volt electric cars expected to come to market by November 2010. A silver GM sedan on display nearby uses electric batteries and a self-contained recharging engine powered by a variety of fuels.  \"I would like people to stop talking mpg,\" Posawatz said, leading a reporter toward a van powered by a hydrogen fuel cell. The Chevy Equinox on display is one of 100 now in private hands. Instead of miles per gallon, the energy plant supplies electricity and a calculation of cruising range while driving.  For now, however, drivers might still be impressed by the ZENN, a little car claiming 280 miles per gallon. The car's cruising range of about 40 miles translates to about 280 miles per gallon, according to the Canadian automaker.  \"ZENN\" stands for Zero Emission No Noise, said a worker who was buffing away some tree pollen that had settled on the car during the breezy afternoon. The car's top speed is about that of a strong gust of wind -- 35 mph.  \"It's supposed to be your third car in the driveway,\" explained ZENN spokesman Daniel Stiller. \"Most people drive less than 20 miles from home on streets with speed limits of 35 miles per hour or less.\"  He acknowledged that the car may qualify as street-legal only on local, low-speed roads. But Stiller said the ZENN is a dramatic improvement in both safety and driveability, compared with the golf carts often seen around retirement communities.  Among the other alternative energy vehicles on display were cars from Mercedes-Benz, Toyota, Honda and the Smart car company.  Another brand shown to lawmakers is named after Nikola Tesla, an inventor who helped develop the practical use of electricity a century ago. Tesla's system of alternating current eventually displaced Thomas Edison's use of direct current in the nation's early power grid.  The red, two-seater electric sports car on display might have been a good fit for Tesla, a lifelong bachelor. Carper, the Delaware senator, suggested the two sports cars were classic \"chick magnets.\"  Tesla spokesman Joe Powers told CNN his company now has about 400 of the sleek, aerodynamic cars in private hands. \"We've created a viable car, and we came out with this model first to help draw attention to the Tesla brand,\" he said.  The California-based company also is developing a a sedan that will use the same advanced battery technology as the sports car, which costs about $109,000.  \"It will be the kind of car you can take on a trip, and carry four passengers and their luggage,\" Powers said. It uses 7,000 lithium-ion cells of the same chemistry now powering cell phones and laptop computers.  \"We are working on a battery exchange program that will cut the cost of these vehicles by about $35,000,\" Powers said, describing a leasing program where owners can swap a used-up battery back for a new one.  Most of the vehicles on display qualify for a new $7,500 federal rebate intended to encourage car buyers to consider alternative-energy vehicles.  Perhaps the vehicle that caused the most double-takes Tuesday was a bucket truck from the local electric utility company serving the Washington, D.C., area. The Pepco vehicle, the kind seen repairing downed power lines, runs on biofuels that range from discarded cooking grease to soybean oil. The truck was apparently not for sale, and there were no representatives nearby to answer questions.", "Q": ["Q: Where was eclectic assortment of alternative-energy vehicles seen this week?

{"article": "LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- George Harrison's closest friends and family gathered in Hollywood on Tuesday to dedicate the late Beatle's star on the Walk of Fame.  From left, musicians Tom Petty, Jeff Lynne and Paul McCartney join Harrison's relatives for dedication of his star.  \"There's someone here from every important stage of George's life and career,\" Harrison's widow, Olivia, said.  Harrison, who was 58 when he died of cancer in 2001, becomes the second Beatle with a Hollywood star. John Lennon was the first.  The new star is next to the iconic Hollywood headquarters of Capitol Records, the distributor of much of Harrison's music for the past five decades.  Tuesday's ceremony coincided with the Capitol/EMI announcement that it will release Harrison's first solo greatest hits collection -- \"Let it Roll: Songs by George Harrison\" -- on June 16.  Actor Tom Hanks said the world changed for him in January 1964 when he heard his first Beatles song.  \"That's when we escaped the doldrums and moved on to a brighter, better, more joyful future,\" Hanks said.  Superstar musicians Paul McCartney, Tom Petty, Joe Walsh and Jeff Lynne attended the star's dedication, but they did not address the crowd.  Scores of Harrison fans showed up for the event, with some traveling from as far as Liverpool, England.  \"We all have deep feelings for George, because he was such a deep-feeling person,\" Olivia Harrison said.  \"He was a beautiful, mystical man, living in a material world,\" she said. \"He was funny as the day is long and just as perplexing.\"  His son, Dhani, 30, joked about his father's star.  \"It's good, it's lovely and it's nice and shiny and I'm glad it's not outside of Frederick's of Hollywood,\" he said.  Harrison was just 15 when schoolmate Paul McCartney asked him to join his and John Lennon's band, the Quarrymen. The band evolved into the Beatles and the rest is history.  Harrison played lead guitar and sang for the Beatles. Songs penned by Harrison included \"Taxman,\" \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps,\" \"Something\" and \"Here Comes the Sun.\"  Harrison was a pioneer of what has since become a tradition of rock stars supporting charitable causes with their music. In 1971, he helped organize the star-studded \"Concert for Bangladesh\" at New York's Madison Square Garden.  In addition to his post-Beatles solo career, Harrison played with several groups -- most notably the Traveling Wilburys, alongside Petty, Lynne, Roy Orbison and Bob Dylan.

{"article": "Washington (CNN) -- A new classified directive to coalition forces in Afghanistan puts restrictions on nighttime raids of Afghan homes and compounds, according to a senior U.S. official who has seen the document.  The official declined to be identified because a declassified version of the document has not been made public. The directive is signed by Gen. Stanley McChrystal, the top NATO commander in Afghanistan, the official said.  The directive comes as the coalition seeks to reduce tension between its military forces and Afghan civilians in an effort to maintain Afghan public support.  Nighttime raids in which troops enter private homes have sparked problems for U.S. and NATO forces. The raids are viewed as overly invasive -- a violation of the privacy of the home in Afghan culture -- and they can turn violent.  The document orders forces to use Afghan troops at night \"whenever possible\" to knock on doors of residences and compounds, and to use them if forcible action is required for entry, the official said.  But the directive also orders troops to \"conduct an analysis\" of whether it is militarily essential to conduct a raid at night or whether it can be put off until daylight, the official said. If troops can keep a target under surveillance but wait for daylight, they then can enlist the aid of village elders, perhaps, in determining if a home or compound poses a threat, the official said.  The official emphasized that troops always have the right to defend themselves and are given leeway to use their best judgment on the battlefield.  McChrystal also is updating another directive, first issued last year, on conducting operations to minimize civilian casualties, the official said.  The updated version, which is yet to be published, will include \"more clarity\" for troops on how to operate in \"escalation of force\" incidents, such as when a vehicle approaches a checkpoint in a potentially threatening manner and troops must decide whether, and when, to fire at it. The official declined to offer further details but said the aim is to make sure even the most junior troops have full understanding of rules and procedures.  Some troops and local commanders have expressed concerns that recent rules can inhibit their ability to take action under fire.

{"article": "NEW YORK (CNN) -- An actor who played a wannabe mobster in \"The Sopranos\" was sentenced Friday to 10 years in prison for a botched burglary that left an off-duty New York police officer dead.  Lillo Brancato Jr. appeared on \"The Sopranos\" and played alongside Robert De Niro in \"A Bronx Tale.\"  The Bronx County District Attorneys Office had sought the maximum of 15 years for Lillo Brancato Jr., who was convicted last month of attempted burglary stemming from a fatal encounter with police officer Daniel Enchautegui.  Before the sentencing, Enchautegui's sister addressed the court to deliver a victim impact statement.  Enchautegui, 28, was shot in the chest when he interrupted an alleged break-in at a neighbor's home in the Bronx but managed to shoot both suspects multiple times before dying.  Brancato was cleared in Enchautegui's death, but his accomplice, Steven Armento, 51, was convicted in the shooting and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.  During the trial, lawyers for Brancato argued that there was not a break-in. Brancato testified that he knew the owner of the home, a Vietnam veteran who had given him permission to enter the house and take painkillers or other pills whenever he wanted.  Brancato testified that he and Armento, 51, were drinking at a strip club when they decided to go hunt for valium. He admitted breaking a window at the home but said it was strictly because he was going through intense heroin withdrawal that night and was trying to wake up his friend to get drugs.

{"article": "MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN)  -- A federal judge ordered 10 municipal police officers arrested Saturday in connection with the slayings of 12 off-duty federal agents in southwestern Mexico, the attorney general's office said.  The recent spate of violence was sparked by the arrest of high-ranking drug cartel member Arnoldo Rueda Medina.  The federal officers' bodies were found Tuesday on a remote highway in Michoacan state, where at least 18 federal agents and two soldiers have been killed since July 11 due to drug-related violence.  Video from the scene showed three signs, known as narcomensajes, or narcomessages, left by the killers. They all stated the same thing: \"So that you come for another. We will be waiting for you here.\"  The officers arrested Saturday are on the police force in the city of Arteaga.  Mexican President Felipe Calderon, whose home state is Michoacan, responded to the violence by dispatching 1,000 federal police officers to the area. The infusion, which more than tripled the number of federal police officers patrolling Michoacan, angered Michoacan Gov. Leonel Godoy Rangel. He called it an occupation and said he had not been consulted.  Authorities said Wednesday they were searching for the governor's half-brother, who they say is a top-ranking member of La Familia Michoacana drug cartel. The cartel is blamed for most of the recent violence in the state. The governor's brother, Julio Cesar Godoy Toscano, was elected July 5 to the lower house of Congress.  The governor has publicly urged his brother to surrender. There were no reports of his apprehension as of late Saturday.  The sudden spike in violence followed the arrest July 11 of Arnoldo Rueda Medina, described as a high-ranking member of La Familia.  La Familia members attacked the federal police station in Morelia to try to gain freedom for Rueda shortly after his arrest, authorities said. When that failed, cartel members attacked federal police installations in at least a half-dozen Michoacan cities.

{"article": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Members of the military may get expedited treatment at airport security checkpoints under a law signed Tuesday by President Obama.  The law, authored by Rep. Chip Cravaack, R-Minnesota, requires the Transportation Security Administration to study ways to speed up screening of service members and, to the extent possible, their families, when the service members are in uniform and traveling on orders.  Cravaack, a 24-year Navy veteran and former Northwest Airlines pilot, was inspired to introduce the bill after witnessing a soldier remove his boots while going through security at the Minneapolis-St. Paul airport.  \"It seemed way too excessive for someone who was obviously a patriot serving his country,\" said the congressman's spokesman, Michael Bars.  The new law was signed just days after two incidents involving the same soldier at airports in North Carolina and Texas.  According to court records, Trey Scott Atwater, a 30-year-old Army Green Beret, had a military smoke grenade in his bag when he was leaving Fayetteville, North Carolina, on Christmas Eve headed for Texas. He was allowed to continue on his trip.  On Saturday, he was arrested at Midland International Airport in Texas on his return trip when TSA screeners found an undisclosed amount of C-4 explosives in his bag. Authorities said Atwater did not have a detonator and initiator, that it would not have been possible to detonate the explosives, and that it did not appear he was up to anything nefarious.  It was not immediately clear how any checkpoint changes would impact cases like Atwater's. Bars said the new law is intended to expedite screening, but not reduce security. Currently, the TSA expedites screening for trusted travelers by dedicating a special line for them, and by allowing them to keep their shoes on and keep laptops in their carry-on bags.  The new law says the TSA should establish guidelines for screening travelers in military uniforms and combat boots, and consider incorporating military personnel into trusted traveler programs that give preference to passengers who undergo pre-screening. Nothing in the law prohibits additional screening of the service member if intelligence or law enforcement information indicates that additional screening is necessary.  In November, TSA Administrator John Pistole told CNN that he was already working on ways to expedite screening for service members. The TSA was starting to tests its ability to scan military ID cards, known as \"Common Access Cards,\" at a regional airport in Monterey, CA.  Pistole said the TSA test would not immediately result in quicker screening for service members. But if tests are successful, \"we hope to expand that to airports that would have a large number of military personnel traveling through them,\" he said.  Supporters of the initiative said that by expediting the screening of military personnel, the TSA will have more time to focus on unknown travelers who could present a higher risk.\"", "Q": ["Q: When do President obama sign the Bill?

{"article": "London, England (CNN) -- \"I had to be stitched into those pants,\" Olivia Newton-John recalls of the skin-tight black trousers she worn in the film \"Grease\".  That fact will come as no surprise to the millions of people who have watched the iconic scene at the end of the smash hit film musical.  \"But they were quite comfortable,\" she assured CNN's Max Foster, \"despite what they looked like.\"  But those trousers, \"made of some sort of shark skin material\" she says, plus a string of memorable songs from the film including \"Summer Nights\" and \"You're The One That I Want\" helped propel Olivia Newton-John to superstardom which has continued to this day.  The British-born actress, who was raised in Australia from the age of five, was already an established singing star -- having won three Grammy Awards -- prior to being cast as Sandy Olssen alongside John Travolta's Danny Zuko in the 1978 film.  And many of the songs from that era still rank among her favorites in a recording career which has produced over 30 albums including the 1981 double platinum selling \"Physical\" -- which spawned the single of the same name and a craze for spandex and leg warmers.  \"The songs I did with John Farrar [the Australian producer and songwriter] are among my favorites. And a lot of those songs, 'Magic' and 'Suspended in Time' are on 'Xanadu,'\" [the soundtrack from the 1980 film].  Of her more recent recordings she cites 2006's \"Grace and Gratitude\" as another favorite. \"It was a healing CD that was very personal for me,\" she said.  After the runaway success of the early 1980s Newton-John was preparing for a comeback in 1992 when she was diagnosed with breast cancer. The diagnosis changed the course of her life forever.  After successfully beating the disease, Newton-John talked openly about her experience and became a passionate advocate for early detection and helping other women cope with the disease.  \"I'm so grateful to be here, 17 years after being diagnosed,\" she told CNN. \"I want to empower other women to be really observant of their breast health and do regular breast self-examination.\"  She also has a Website -- http://www.liv.com// -- which provides information on breast self-examination.  \"When I talk to women in my age bracket, they're afraid. I understand the fear but if there is something wrong, the earlier you find it, the better chance you have of a healthy outcome,\" she said.  Cancer awareness isn't the only cause she lends her name to. Along with her second husband John Easterling, who she married in 2008, Newton-John helps promote education about rainforests.  \"We're helping educate the children of the Amazon to realize the importance of the living rainforest so that when the timber and oil companies come in they know to save it.\"  Three decades on from her life-changing appearance in \"Grease\", Newton-John is still finding plenty things in her life to become hopelessly devoted to.", "Q": ["Q: What is Olivia Newton-John's profession?

{"article": " -- After stints as a guard in the jails of Washington, D.C., and on the streets of post-Katrina New Orleans, Stephen Tyrone Johns had settled in to a job he liked at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, family members said.  Security officer Stephen Johns reportedly opened the door for the man police say was his killer.  \"It seemed to be kind of laid-back -- it didn't seem to be that dangerous,\" Leroy Carter, the stepfather who helped raise Johns since he was 3, told CNN affiliate WUSA-TV in Washington. \"He had wanted to be on the Metro Police force or places like that, but I would have rather him been where he was.  \"But it just backfired.\"  Johns, 39, was shot and killed while on duty Wednesday -- allegedly gunned down by an 88-year-old white supremacist who stepped into the museum with a rifle and began firing.  Johns is remembered by friends and family as a \"gentle giant\" -- he stood 6 feet 6 inches, according to Carter. And he lived up to the moniker to the very end.  One of his last acts was reaching out and opening the door for the man who shot him, police said.  Watch museum officials pay tribute \u00bb  James von Brunn, an outspoken Holocaust denier who had served six years in prison for a 1981 kidnapping attempt, was shot and wounded by Johns' fellow officers. He remained in critical condition Thursday at George Washington University Hospital.  Johns, a six-year veteran of the museum's security staff, was a resident and native of Temple Hills, Maryland.  In the hours following the shooting, friends and co-workers repeatedly remembered \"Big John\" for his quiet, friendly nature.  \"To look at him initially he was very intimidating,\" said Alan Burkee, a friend and former co-worker at the museum. \"But he was very shy.... He had a great demeanor -- very pleasant, very courteous to all the visitors that came in and the staff that worked there.\"  Friends said Johns was an avid Washington Redskins fan and loved to travel, but lived just 10 minutes away from where his mother and stepfather raised him.  He had an 11-year-old son, Stephen Jr., and recently had remarried, according to friends.  \"He was a pretty great guy,\" Stephen Johns Jr., known as \"Little Stephen\" to family, told WUSA. \"He was always there for me when I was down or sad.\"  Carter had picked up Stephen after school to tell him the news of the shooting, and the two were on the way to the hospital when Johns died.  Steve Maritas is organizing director with the International Union of Security, Police and Fire Professionals of America -- of which Johns was a member.  He said the way Johns and his fellow officers responded Wednesday saved lives -- and it flies in the face of the stereotype of the run-of-the-mill security guard.  \"If that was the case, there would have been 50 people shot yesterday,\" said Maritas, whose organization represents more than 30,000 officers nationally and about 5,000 in the Washington area.  \"These guys are very highly trained, highly paid officers. It's not like they're just there wearing a uniform.\"  Johns had worked for Wackenhut Security Inc. since 2003.  Maritas said Johns and his colleagues trained for days like Wednesday -- when years of safety and quiet give way to a sudden burst of terror.  \"Hopefully, you'll never have to use your gun,\" he said. \"But you get a situation where you get a crazy guy like this -- it happens within two or three seconds.\"  For Carter, there will always a clear reminder of the stepson he raised as his own. Little Stephen, he said, looks and acts just like his father did at that age.  Carter said he takes comfort knowing that the roughly 2,000 people visiting the Holocaust museum at the time of the attack were able to walk away unharmed.  \"That guy wouldn't have stopped until he was stopped,\" Carter said.", "Q": ["Q: Where did Stephen Johns work?

{"article": "  -- Two people were found dead and a third person is still believed missing in a North Carolina food plant heavily damaged in a morning explosion, police said Tuesday night.  Part of a collapsed ConAgra Foods plant lies atop parked cars Tuesday in Garner, North Carolina.  Four people were in critical condition after the explosion at the ConAgra Foods plant in the town of Garner, CNN affiliate WRAL-TV reported.  The explosion, reported about 11:30 a.m. Tuesday, caused sections of the roof to collapse. Search efforts for those missing were slowed by ammonia leaks and a fire that was not extinguished until afternoon.  \"There was no warnings, no signs,\" Garner Mayor Ronnie Williams said. \"It all happened very abruptly.\"  At least 38 people were transported to area hospitals, said Jeff Hammerstein, district chief for Wake County Emergency Medical Services.  Four burn victims -- two males and two females -- were undergoing critical care at the North Carolina Jaycees Burn Center, said Dr. Charles Cairns, director of emergency medicine for UNC Hospitals. The patients suffered burns that covered from 40 to 60 percent of their bodies, Cairns said.  Police said recovery workers still were trying to get the two bodies out of the plant, which makes Slim Jim food products. The victims' names weren't immediately available.  More than 300 people were in the plant when the explosion happened, authorities said. The cause of the blast was unknown, according to Garner police spokesman Joe Binns.  Rescuers were crawling into the rubble -- sometimes in pockets of space less than 30 inches tall -- in attempts to access the two bodies and find the missing person, officials said at a news conference Tuesday night.  The search crews were moving slowly in part because the building is very unstable, officials said.  Video from the scene showed holes in sections of the roof of the 425,000 square-foot plant. First responders set up a makeshift triage area near the building. A section of the roof was collapsed, and pipes could be seen spewing liquid believed to be ammonia.  Watch liquid spew from building \u00bb  ConAgra Foods' brands include Healthy Choice, Chef Boyardee and Orville Redenbacher, among others.

{"article": " -- Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger said Monday he won't appeal the six-game suspension imposed by the National Football League and apologized to his teammates and fans for a night out that left him under a Georgia prosecutor's microscope.  \"Missing games will be devastating for me,\" Roethlisberger said in a statement issued through the team.  \"I am sorry to let down my teammates and the entire Steelers fan base. I am disappointed that I have reached this point and will not put myself in this situation again.\"  Roethlisberger, who led the Steelers to Super Bowl titles in 2006 and 2009, faced the threat of criminal charges after a woman accused him of raping her in a Milledgeville, Georgia, bar during a night of drinking in March.  The quarterback's lawyer said no sexual assault took place, and prosecutors decided earlier this month that they could not prove a crime had been committed.  But NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell slapped the quarterback with a six-game suspension for \"conduct detrimental to the NFL\" last week, ordering him to undergo a \"comprehensive behavioral evaluation by medical professionals,\" follow their recommendations and \"avoid situations that can cause legal or other problems.\"  If Roethlisberger complies, the suspension could be cut to four games, or it could be extended if he doesn't, the league said.  In his statement, Roethlisberger said the suspension imposed last week \"speaks clearly that more is expected of me,\" and he promised to \"make the necessary improvements\" in his behavior.  \"Though I have committed no crime, I regret that I have fallen short of the values instilled in me by my family,\" he said. \"I will not appeal the suspension and will comply with what is asked of me -- and more.\"  The 28-year-old quarterback owns a home at a lake near Milledgeville, Georgia, about 115 miles southeast of Atlanta.

{"article": "Los Angeles (CNN) -- Michael Jackson's fear that promoters would \"pull the plug\" on his comeback concerts if he missed more rehearsals was unfounded, the head of the promotion company testified Tuesday in Dr. Conrad Murray's involuntary manslaughter trial.  \"No one on our end was ever contemplating pulling the plug,\" said Randy Phillips, the head of AEG Live.  Murray's defense lawyers contend Jackson self-administered the overdose of drugs that killed him in a \"desperate desire to get to sleep,\" because he feared without rest he would miss his next rehearsal and trigger the cancellation of his \"This Is It\" tour.  Jackson's mother, Katherine, sisters Janet and La Toya, and brother Randy Jackson were in court to watch Tuesday's testimony.  Earlier Tuesday, a nurse who tried to treat Jackson's insomnia with natural remedies testified that Jackson told her that doctors assured him using the surgical anesthetic propofol at home to induce sleep was safe as long as he was monitored.  Jackson died two months after that conversation with nurse Cherilyn Lee, from what the coroner ruled was an overdose of the surgical anesthetic propofol, combined with sedatives.  Prosecutors contend Dr. Murray's use of propofol to treat Jackson's insomnia in his home was reckless, in part because he did not have proper equipment to monitor his patient and he abandoned him to make phone calls.  Phillips was the eighth witness called by the defense since the prosecution rested its case against Murray Monday morning.  If the tour was canceled, Jackson would have to pay for all of the production and rehearsal costs, Phillips said, although the judge would not let him tell jurors how much that might have been.  Defense lawyer Ed Chernoff estimated the cost to be about $40 million, leaving him \"a very, very poor man,\" but it was not while the jury was present.  Concert director Kenny Ortega sent Phillips an e-mail five days before Jackson's death referring to Jackson's fear the company would \"pull the plug\" on the tour. The e-mail triggered a meeting with Jackson and Dr. Murray to address Ortega's concerns about Jackson's \"lack of focus\" and missed rehearsals, with the debut of his London shows just three weeks away.  He and Ortega were satisfied when Jackson told them \"You build the house and I will put on the door and paint it,\" suggesting he would be ready, Phillips testified.  Also at the meeting, Phillips told Dr. Murray that he wanted to make sure he knew about Jackson's visits to another doctor, dermatologist Dr. Arnold Klein. \"Because he's his principal physician, I thought he should know,\" he said.  Phillips said he was concerned because Jackson \"seemed a little distracted and not focused\" in a meeting after a visit to Klein's Beverly Hills clinic.  The defense contends Jackson became addicted to the painkiller Demerol in his frequent visits to Klein in the three months before his death. His withdrawal from the Demerol, which Murray was unaware of, would explain why Jackson could not sleep the day he died, the defense contends.  Testimony from nurse Cherilyn Lee's was interrupted for 25 minutes Tuesday as she was overcome with emotion. \"I'm feeling really, really dizzy,\" Lee said. \"This is just very sensitive to me.\"  Lee and a Los Angeles doctor, both called as defense witnesses, testified that Jackson asked them for drugs to help him sleep in April 2009. This was after Dr. Murray had already agreed to work as his personal physician and placed his first orders for propofol.  Lee, who used IV drips loaded with vitamins, \"sophisticated\" vitamin smoothies and bedtime teas, to treat Jackson's insomnia, said Jackson became frustrated with her natural remedies.  \"He said 'I'm telling you the only thing that's going to help me sleep right away is the Diprivan and can you find someone to help me to sleep?'\" Lee said. Diprivan is a brand name for propofol.  After some quick research, the nurse warned Jackson that it was dangerous to use propofol at home, Lee testified.  Jackson was not deterred, she said, even after she asked him \"but what if you don't wake up?\"  Deputy District Attorney David Walgren asked her, \"And he responded, 'I will be OK, I only need someone to monitor me with the equipment while I sleep'?\"  \"Yes, that's exactly what I said,\" Lee said.  Dr. Allan Metzger, who treated Jackson off and on for two decades for \"his profound sleep disorder,\" testified Monday that Jackson called him to his home on April 18, 2009, to ask for \"intravenous sleep medicine\" to help him sleep.  Jackson wanted the anesthetic delivered by IV because \"he did not believe any oral medicine would be helpful,\" Dr. Metzger said.  Metzger declined Jackson's request, instead giving him prescriptions for two oral sedatives to help him sleep.", "Q": ["Q: What are the names of Jackson's sisters?

{"article": "London, England -- Petra Nemcova is a former Victoria's Secret supermodel-turned-philanthropist.  Despite her riches, Nemcova, who grew up with few luxuries in communist Czechoslovakia, told CNN that her most important work is her charity, the Happy Hearts Fund.  The model set up the foundation after her near-death experience in the 2004 Asian tsunami. While Nemcova survived by clinging to a palm tree for eight hours, her long-term partner did not.  Here, Nemcova shows CNN around Prague and tells of her love for the \"Golden City,\" what she learnt from growing up in a communist country and how she keeps smiling -- despite life's setbacks.  CNN: Tell us about the first time you came to Prague.  Petra Nemcova: The first time was to visit my aunt and even if Prague is in the same country as my town, it felt like a real journey. For us it was like going somewhere very special, far away, because under the Communist regime you didn't travel that much and Prague was \"wow.\"  I was overwhelmed and amazed by the beauty of Prague and every time I arrive in Prague, even now, I'm still amazed. The lighting at night; the incredible architecture; the details; the history; there was a lot to learn about and a lot to discover. It was a very special experience.  The following time I went to Prague was during my early career in the fashion industry and I was traveling once, twice a week from my town to Prague. I would wake up at 5.45 in the morning, take the bus for one hour, then a tram to school. After school I would take a five-hour train to Prague. So it was quite intense at that time, but it was a great experience and it taught me a lot about being independent.  CNN: How would you describe Prague, in five words?  Petra Nemcova: Prague is a city of romance, of incredible architecture and history. Some people call it the \"golden city,\" some people say it's the heart of Europe -- although maybe the French don't like that very much! Paris is bigger obviously and a bit more hectic and Prague is smaller and has more of a village-y feeling compared to Paris. Prague has more of a calming vibe. It's not rush-rush-rush.  I think when people come here they are surprised by the beauty of Prague and also the vivid colors. I think they may imagine Prague more in gray colors because of the communist association. But since then a lot of reconstruction has been done. Before Prague was shades of grey and black, which was quite mysterious, but now it's more happy and pretty.  In five words it's historical, inspirational, creative, romantic and beautiful.  CNN: What was your childhood like?  Petra Nemcova: Growing up in the Czech Republic -- at the time Czechoslovakia -- was a beautiful childhood because I didn't understand the whole concept of communism. I was only 11 when communism fell down and when the Velvet Revolution happened. I had a really beautiful childhood... I didn't have the great luxury things, we had very little and we counted every penny. But our parents gave us something more valuable than money -- they gave us so much love and that's priceless.  We didn't get the opportunity to travel all over the world and were able to travel only within the communist countries. So we went around our country to see different castles, little towns and I loved it. So that made us richer. It also made us appreciate nature because we spent every weekend in nature. And the values you learn there are priceless too. You don't step on flowers, kick on mushrooms, you really respect nature.  And the value of appreciation came from not having anything and then having a little bit. Having a clementine for Christmas -- it was an incredible joy and every time I smell a clementine, it brings me back to my childhood.  But it was harder for my parents. Because if you weren't part of the system then you didn't get a job and an apartment and it would be really difficult for you. My parents had these passports where every time they would go to these communist meetings they would get a stamp and if you didn't get enough stamps throughout the year, you would get in trouble.  CNN: What happened to you in the 2004 tsunami?  Petra Nemcova: I lost my partner and physically, my pelvis was broken four times, I was drowning many times throughout the experience. There were hard moments throughout that experience and some sweet ones. Seeing the compassion of other people risking their lives for strangers, there was just a lot of love around in that moment. That's what happens actually if you live through disasters, it brings people together, it shows that we are capable of that compassion, but unfortunately it just goes away after some time.  CNN: Tell us about your foundation, Happy Hearts?  Petra Nemcova: Happy Hearts is a foundation that I established after the tsunami. It helps children improve their lives after natural disasters through educational and sustainable initiatives. We build or rebuild a school, add computer labs inside and then we build businesses to sustain the school. The education is really a key not just for the children to recover faster from the disaster but also to help them, their families and communities get out of poverty. We help over 23,000 children a year. We give them hope and not just for them but for their parents and communities. The schools elevate the whole community.  After the tsunami we went to other countries where disasters happened and one of them was in Indonesia. We work with local partners on the ground and have been able to build 33 kindergartens after the 2005 earthquake and that's something incredible because it really changed so many lives.  Our other project is in Peru, where there was an earthquake in 2007 and we have a commitment to build three schools a year.  CNN: If you only had 24 hours in Prague, what would you do?  Petra Nemcova: First of all I would take my friends and family and I would walk around and go to the Charles Bridge because that is my favorite place. Then I would stop by some exhibitions of some new artist. And then I would go and sit down for some tea perhaps at the Musical House. In the evening I may go to a typical Czech pub and afterwards for a concert because I really love them; they put my mind at ease and inspire me.  CNN: How creative is the city?  Petra Nemcova: Many people know about Kafka and some of the other famous writers. But there is a lot of interest in music here and in different types of art. That's perhaps because art was suppressed during communist times and you were only allowed to read certain authors. That's why there is such a hunger now for everything that was forbidden. Not just Czech authors but also a lot of American authors because especially anything from U.S. was big taboo and you could not see any movies and you could not listen to any music. I discovered Stevie Wonder seven years ago and I'm still working on learning and seeing more of the great movies.  CNN: If Prague were a person, who would it be?  Petra Nemcova: I think Prague would be our former president Vaclav Havel. He is a proud person and Prague is a proud city; he's an artist and Prague is artistic; he's an achiever and Prague has achieved so much. He is someone people admire, as they do Prague.", "Q": ["Q: Who shows CNN around her \"Golden City,\" Prague? A:", "Q: What did the supermodel show CNN around? A:", "Q: Who survived the 2004 tsunami?

{"article": "LONDON, England (CNN)  -- The mysterious disappearance of Flight AF 447 over the Atlantic Ocean has fueled speculation among aviation experts about what caused the state-of-the-art airliner to come down.  An airliner is struck by lightning strike at Washington's Dulles airport last year.  According to Air France CEO Pierre-Henri Gourgeon, the Airbus A330-200 encountered heavy turbulence about 02:15 a.m. local time Monday (10:15 p.m. ET Sunday), three hours after the jet carrying 228 people left Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, for Paris, France.  At that point, the plane's automatic system initiated a four-minute exchange of messages to the company's maintenance computers, indicating \"several pieces of aircraft equipment were at fault or had broken down.\"  The jet, which was flying at 35,000 feet and at 521 mph, also sent a warning that it had lost pressure, the Brazilian air force said. Its last known contact occurred at 02:33 a.m., the Brazilian air force spokesman added.  The assumption is that these electrical problems led to a catastrophic failure of the aircraft's controls.  What brought Flight AF 447 down? \u00bb  Some experts have said that a lightning strike was a possibility, particularly since the plane disappeared in a storm-prone area along the equator known as the Intertropical Convergence zone (ITCZ). This is where the trade winds of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres converge. The intense sun and warm water of the equator heats the air in the ITCZ, raising its humidity and making it buoyant. Aided by the convergence of the trade winds, the buoyant air rises, releasing the accumulated moisture in an almost constant series of thunderstorms.  The airliner's route \u00bb  According to CNN's Mari Ramos, these storms can reach altitudes of 52,000 ft -- way beyond the capacity of commercial airliners to fly over.  Watch more about the weather systems \u00bb  Retired airline pilot John Cox told CNN that modern aircraft receive a constant stream of real time weather data which allows them to plot a course around storms. \"Because safety is the paramount concern, airliners don't fly into storms. They fly around them,\" he said.  \"The ITCZ is no different. Planes fly through it every day.  \"At 8 miles per minute, modern jets can easily fly around storms. Even if they encounter turbulence, they're designed to absorb it.\"  When lightning strikes a plane, the bolt typically hits a sharp part of it, such as a wing tip. Huge amounts of energy surge through the aircraft before exiting out of another sharp point, such as the tail. But sometimes high voltages can cause electrical damage if components are not well-grounded.  Unlike other aircraft where the pilot's controls are manually attached to the flaps and rudders, Airbus 330 airliners are equipped with a \"fly by wire\" system that sends electronic signals from an onboard computer to move key control surfaces.  Experts say that it is possible for this system and its back-up computers to be disabled by lightning. \"If you have a massive electrical problem it's possible that you could cut off all the commands out to the control surfaces,\" said aeronautics expert John Hansman.  However, Kieran Daly, from the online aviation news service Air Transport Intelligence, told CNN that this scenario, while not impossible, is inconceivable. \"It's more likely that lightning would cause a fire or punch a hole through the aircraft structure,\" he said.  \"It could be significant that the jet reported a loss of pressure.\"  He added that the aircraft would be able to continue without the fly-by-wire system. The \"trim tab,\" which enables the pilot to manually manipulate controls such as the rudder, would allow the crew to fly the aircraft safely. \"Pilots are routinely trained for these kinds of events in a simulator,\" he said.  Former Airbus pilot John Wiley said on average every airliner is hit by a strike once a year. \"They don't go down,\" he said.  According to Air France, the captain of Flight AF 447 had a record of 11,000 flight hours and had already flown 1,700 hours on Airbus A330/A340 aircraft. Of the two first officers, one had flown 3,000 flight hours (800 of which on the Airbus A330/A340) and the other 6,600 (2,600 on the Airbus A330/A340).  The aircraft had totaled 18,870 flight hours and went into service on 18 April 2005. Its last maintenance check in the hangar took place on 16 April 2009.", "Q": ["Q: What did tthe CEO say?

{"article": " -- There is a region of the world where the weather is always hot and humid and it rains almost every day of the year. Sounds predictable, right? But weather in the Intertropical Convergence Zone, or ITCZ, can be volatile and dangerous.  Air France Flight 447 went down in a volatile zone along the equator between South America and Africa.  The Intertropical Convergence Zone, which circles the Earth near the equator, is where officials say Air France Flight 447 plunged into the Atlantic Ocean. While weather has not been cited as a reason for the plane's crash, the tragedy does call attention to the region.  The ITCZ is a belt of low pressure that wraps around the planet. Clouds and storms form along it because it is literally where the winds of the world's hemispheres meet.  High pressure in the Northern Hemisphere churns air from the northeast toward the equator. On the flip side, air is steered from the southeast by high pressure in the Southern Hemisphere. The winds that move this air toward the equator are also known as \"trade winds\" and converge in the middle of the tropics. That's where the Intertropical Convergence Zone name comes from.  Here, air and water temperatures are typically in the mid-80s. The warm, moist air is heated further by the blazing tropical sun. Steamy air, coming off the ocean, rises until it hits cooler, drier air aloft, forming clouds and thunderstorms. These gigantic storms contain volatile updrafts and downdrafts that can move at speeds of 100 mph.  The height of these storms also can tower to more than 10 miles in the air. Even if you stacked two dozen of the world's tallest skyscrapers on top of each other, they still wouldn't reach the tops of the biggest thunderstorms of the ITCZ.  Former Air Force meteorologist Tim Vasquez wrote about thunderstorms over the Atlantic at the time of the Air France plane's disappearance on his Web site, weathergraphics.com.  \"Based on the infrared satellite imagery, I was able to...estimate the altitude of the thunderstorms at around 51,000 feet,\" he told CNN in a phone interview.  Vasquez himself has flown through the ITCZ at least half a dozen times.  \"I remember flying from Guam to the Philippines, constantly weaving around the thunderstorms. Sometimes, though, pilots are forced to fly through them,\" he said.  That's because commercial airliners cannot fly above 50,000 feet. In addition, ITCZ thunderstorms can merge with one another to stretch far and wide, covering hundreds of miles.  The crew of Air France Flight 447 reported severe turbulence shortly before the plane disappeared.  How did the plane break into pieces? \u00bb  When it's not storming in the ITCZ, the weather can be completely calm, with little to no wind. This stretch of ocean was particularly dreaded by sailors of the 19th century, who named it \"The Doldrums,\" because its lack of wind could leave them stuck at sea, unable to propel forward.  Despite these challenges and dangers, planes and ships successfully cross the ITZC every day, thanks in part to technology that has made it easier to see where the thunderstorms are.  Here are some commonly asked questions:  Can hurricanes form in the ITCZ?  It's extremely rare for a hurricane to form near the equator. However, the ITCZ doesn't stay in one place all year long. In the summer, for example, it drifts more northward, where it's possible for tropical cyclones to develop from the thunderstorms there.  What does the ITCZ have to do with the \"monsoon season\" in Asia?  Since the position of the ITCZ fluctuates, the location of the heaviest rainfalls varies depending on the time of year. When the zone drifts more northward in May and June, it brings the rainy season to places like Southeast Asia and India. The term \"monsoon\" refers to a seasonal reversal of winds.", "Q": ["Q: What is the weather like in the ITCZ? A:", "Q: Where did the plane crash? A:", "Q: Which airlines plane was involved?

Dilshan made 109 as Sri Lanka, seeking a win to level the series at 1-1, closed on 366 for eight wickets on the opening day.  All-rounder Angelo Mathews was closing on his first Test century with an unbeaten 86 on a wicket offering turn and bounce, but was rapidly running out of partners to the second new ball.  India, who won the second Test in Kanpur last week by a crushing innings and 144 runs, will take over from South Africa as the top-ranked Test team in the world if they can win the series 2-0.  Off-spinner Harbhajan Singh claimed four victims and slow left-armer Pragyan Ojha two but Dilshan proved a formidable opponent.  He continued his superb 2009 with 10 boundaries and two sixes to reach three figures for the 11th time in Tests.  He made 112 in the high-scoring draw in the first Test in Ahmedabad.

Ben Kingsely who stars in \"Teen Patti\" is the first Academy Award-winner ever to take a role in a Bollywood movie.  Bollywood-produced \"Teen Patti\" (\"Card Game\") also marks Kingsley's first return to Indian filmmaking since playing the title role in \"Gandhi,\" the critically-acclaimed biopic of the Indian leader that propelled him to fame in 1982.  He is the first Oscar-winning Hollywood actor ever to star in a Bollywood movie, and Kingsley believes that the future of filmmaking could lie in combining the twin talents of the world's biggest film industries.  \"I think the two talents put together could be extraordinary,\" Kingsley told CNN in Cannes where he was promoting \"Teen Patti.\"  The 65 year-old English actor maintains that western cinema is suffering from a lack of originality and \"heart,\" with many films just ending up as a \"copy of a copy of a copy.\"  He thinks that the Indian approach to filmmaking can give western productions the infusion of originality they need -- and that filmmakers in India can benefit from \"the technology, and the casting opportunities, the directorial opportunities of the west.\"  \"Teen Patti\" is set in India and the UK, where Kingsley shot all of his scenes, and uses English and Hindi dialogue. The drama, which cost a mere $7 million to make, will have its world premiere in Mumbai in August.  Watch CNN The Screening Room producer Neil Curry search for Ben Kingsely in Cannes \u00bb  It tells the story of a university professor, played by Bachchan, who schools five of his most able students in the finer points of high-stakes gambling.

Tell us below in the SoundOff box  Kingsley says he has wanted to be associated with mainstream Indian film ever since he made \"Gandhi\" -- an Indo-British production and so not \"entirely an Indian film\"-- with director Richard Attenborough in India.  The actor who is acclaimed for performances in \"Sexy Beast\" (2000) and \"Schindler's List\" (1993) says he wanted to know what it would be like to work with an Indian director -- Leena Yadav, \"who was amazing\" -- and a huge Indian star like Bachchan.  \"I was very curious about him and he was very curious about me,\" says Kingsley of working with 66 year-old Bachchan, or \"Big B\" as India's most prominent Bollywood star is affectionately known to audiences.  Bachchan's deep voice and brooding persona changed the face of Hindi cinema in the 1970s. Up until then Bollywood screens had been populated by wisecracking loverboys -- the trademark Indian hero in the 1960s. Today, he is best-known for hosting the Indian version of \"Who Wants To Be a Millionaire\" (\"Kaun Banega Crorepati\").  Kingsley says that while on set, he and Bachchan \"circled each other like hunters.\"  Despite his respect for the Godfather of Bollywood, Kingsley refused to socialize with the star: \"Because my character in this film is discovering Bachchan's character and if it's all frittered away in social 'bla-bla' there's nothing left to discover.\"  Kingsley's Indian connection goes back even further than \"Gandhi.\" The British actor was born Krishna Bhanji to an English mother an Indian father and adopted his British name while at drama school.  Apart from his Bollywood work Kingsley has just finished filming a Martin Scorsese directed period drama, \"Shutter Island,\" which is expected to hit cinemas later this year.  He is also busy producing his own films as part of SBK Pictures, the production company he founded in 2007, as he says, \"putting into practice all the things that one has learnt along the way.\"  The company currently has five films in development, one of which is a drama about native Indians called \"Whispers Like Thunder.\"  For Kingsley, producing is a chance to have some control over the filmmaking process that isn't possible as an actor.  \"It's tragic when [a film] just misses,\" he told CNN. \"If you'd made a slight adjustment in your casting, or your writing, or your director of photography or the rhythm of editing, it could have been absolutely perfect.\"  Other Hollywood stars mixing with Bollywood include Sylvester Stallone, who will appear in Sabir Khan's romantic comedy, \"Kambakkht Ishq\" and Mickey Rourke is set to star in Vidhu Vinod Chopra's Hollywood debut, \"Broken Horses.\"", "Q": ["Q: who is amitabh bachman?

{"article": "(MENTAL FLOSS) -- College admissions are competitive, and not just from the student's side. Sure, sometimes it's hard to get into the college of your choice, but the schools are fighting just as hard to lure in top applicants.  Davidson college students don't have to visit laundromats because they enjoy the luxury of a free laundry service.  While some colleges boast about class sizes, graduate fellowships, and endowment growth rates, this sort of info is likely to bore the 17-year-old students they're wooing. Instead, some schools try to come up with unique perks that appeal to students, often in the form of free services.  While the cost of these \"free\" perks is undoubtedly built back into tuition bills, when a family's spending upwards of $40,000 a year for school, it can't hurt to help them feel like they're getting something for nothing. Here are a few you might be jealous of:  1. Free laundry  Nothing's more maddening for a college student than wanting to study, party, or sleep, only to be confronted with a massive mound of laundry. Most of us know that if left unchecked, these piles of dirty clothes can grow until they're on the brink of becoming sentient beings, but students at Davidson, an elite liberal arts college in North Carolina, don't have to worry about it. Their college does the laundry for them.  Since 1919, Davidson has been operating a laundry facility that allows students to drop off their laundry and pick it up once its clean and smelling of dryer sheets. At the Lula Bell Houston Laundry, students' dress shirts and blouses are even pressed and put on hangers for them.  The laundry clears about six tons' worth of dirty clothes and linens a week, but if students prefer to keep their filthy T-shirts to themselves, the school also offers free self-service washers and dryers in the dorms.  As if that's not enough, Davidson was even more generous when its basketball team made a miraculous run to the NCAA's Sweet 16 last March. The school shelled out the cash for free bus transport to the venue in Detroit, two nights' lodging, and a free ticket to the game for any student who wanted to go cheer on their Cinderella in person. Mental Floss: 8 tuition-free colleges  2. Free skiing  Michigan Technological University offers a pretty standard slate of majors for its students, but it also has a real estate holding that might lure in applicants. The school owns Mont Ripley, a ski slope on the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. While normal lift-ticket prices run at around $35 a day, Michigan Tech students can hit the slopes without dropping a dime.  3. Free computers  At my undergrad alma mater, Wake Forest, one of the chief perks is that when you showed up for freshman orientation, the school gives you a fully loaded IBM Thinkpad and a printer. Students keep this laptop for two years, then trade it in for a new model before their junior year. Students then take this one with them when they graduate.  While there was a downside to the system (if profs know everyone has a laptop, they're not the least bit shy about making you tote it to class), it really upped the on-campus computing efficiency. Any program you needed for a class was already loaded on the laptop, and since everyone on campus was operating one of only two types of machines, tech support could diagnose problems and fix them really quickly. Mental Floss: 12 college classes we wish our schools offered  4. Free theater tickets  Nothing irks actors and theater owners quite so much as playing to an empty house, so if tickets are moving slowly, why not fill the seats with college students? NYU's Ticket Central can wrangle Broadway and Off-Broadway tickets for up to 75 percent off their face values, but sometimes, the school can get lucky students into theaters for free to help fill otherwise thin crowds.  Ticket Central also boasts that it can get students into Knicks games for as little as $12 and into Mets games for just $3. Of course, the way those teams have played in the last year or so, that offer might scare off more prospective students than it entices.  5. Personalized birthday cakes  College birthdays are often all sorts of debauched fun, but at least in my experience, they were often sorely lacking in quality cake. Sure, sometimes you'd get a pan full of Betty Crocker-ed good intentions cooked in a dorm oven, which are precisely calibrated to burn cakes' edges while leaving the center liquid, but it was rare to see a real birthday cake.  Ohio University's dining services can fix that, though, by allowing students' parents to join the Birthday Club. For $18, parents can make sure their kid gets a personalize birthday cake and all of the plates, napkins, and forks they'll need to share it with their friends.  6. Cheap golf  College students who want to golf on a tight budget often have to resign themselves to finding the rattiest municipal course they can find and hoping they survive the ordeal. Students at Stanford, though, have access to the Stanford Golf Course, a legendary course that's hosted such greats as Tom Watson and Tiger Woods since it opened in 1930.  Only students, alumni, faculty, and their guests can enjoy the course's picturesque views of San Francisco, and for guests the price is pretty steep, up to $110 a round. Students, though, get a great deal on greens fees; they can get in a full round for just $25.

{"article": " -- Shortly after McDonald's celebrated its 30-year presence in France, the fast-food chain is conquering one of the country's most valued cultural institutions --the Louvre.  McDonalds' burgers and fries will be available under the inverted glass pyramid of the Louvre.  The restaurant will be serving its fast burgers in the Carrousel du Louvre, an underground shopping mall which lies under the main entrance of the museum and which still contains an ancient wall that was discovered during construction works.  McDonald's' plans seem to have caused more media attention abroad than in France, but for some French outlets, the idea of combining fast food and ancient art is stomach churning.  The Parisian Web site \"Louvre pour tous\" (Louvre for everyone) describes McDonald's' decision to open a restaurant in the prestigious museum as \"bad taste\" and blamed the Louvre's directors for failing to prevent what could result in \"fragrances of fries drifting under Mona Lisa's nose\".  A spokeswoman for the museum told CNN it was not their decision and declined to comment further on the issue.  The Carrousel du Louvre mall is managed by Unibail-Rodamco, Europe's largest property company, and not the museum itself.  The mall, which is situated next to the most visited museum in the world, counts 8.3 million visitors a year and enjoyed a total gross sales of $75 million in 2008.  Le Parisien, a daily newspaper described the difference between McDonald's and the Louvre by comparing Ronald McDonald, the restaurant's clown character, to Venus de Milo, the famous ancient Greek statue of Aphrodite, which is on display at the Louvre.  Should McDonald's be in the Louvre? Tell us what you think in the Soundoff box below.  Museum lovers in France are shocked about the news, but not surprised.  \"Museums have to offer services like restaurants and boutiques, it's completely normal,\" Jean-Michel Raingeard, President of the Federation of French Friends of Museums told CNN.  What worries him, however, is the choice of shops.  \"Museum directors seem to care more about the number of people they attract rather than the quality of people. Should a museum be a museum or an amusement park?\" asks Jean Michel Raingeard, who is also the European vice president for The World Federation of Friends of Museums.  McDonald's sees the opening of its new restaurant next to the home of Mona Lisa as something completely normal.  \"There are already many other restaurants in the mall, so we will only be one of the many restaurants that offer visitors their products.\" says a spokeswoman for McDonald's in France. \"There's even a Starbucks,\" she added.  Criticism, though fierce, has not been successful: the construction work will start soon and the restaurant should be open \"by the end of the year.\"  In spite of its location, the menu will very likely stay the same. \"McDonald's functions the same way in all of France, so there will probably be no special menus,\" the spokeswoman said.", "Q": ["Q: What is mcDonald's going to do?

{"article": "NEW DELHI, India -- Police covered up the murder of a British teenage girl in Goa last month to protect the tourist industry, a state minister and local media said Monday.  Scarlett Keeling stands on Anjuna beach in Goa a few days before her death.  Officers had initially said Scarlett Keeling had drowned on Anjuna beach after taking drugs, but changed their story when the 15-year-old's mother protested and a second autopsy suggested she had been raped and murdered.  A suspect in the case was arrested Sunday but Fiona MacKeown said she did not believe he was the man who killed her daughter.  \"This is a clear case of murder and it has gone out of proportion because the police tried to cover it up,\" Francisco X. Pacheco, Goa's Tourism Minister told Reuters.com.  Indian media suggested the cover-up was an attempt to protect Goa's tourism industry.  \"They should have arrested this man a long time ago and this issue would have got diluted, but now because of the tainted image of some police officers in the case, things have gone out of hand,\" Pacheco said.  Police said they were investigating allegations of a cover-up and the actions of junior officers.  \"There are certain things under my scrutiny and I have taken cognizance of all these issues, specially these officers,\" Kishan Kumar, a senior police officer overseeing the probe told Reuters.  Keeling's mother said she also believed police were trying to cover up the truth behind her daughter's murder, and that they had arrested Samson D'Souza, 29, to make it look like they were making progress in the case.  \"We've had an awful lot of contact with people that have been in this situation before, and they've warned us to be careful (that) the police will try and find someone immediately to try and put a front on it that they're actually doing something,\" Fiona MacKeown told BBC radio on Monday.  Kumar described D'Souza as a \"local Anjuna boy\" who was a bartender at Liu's, a beachfront bar. He said police had confirmed D'Souza's role in Keeling's rape and were now trying to find evidence that he killed the teenager.  \"We have sufficient evidence to show that he was involved in rape,\" Kumar told CNN. \"So far as murder is concerned, we are investigating further.\"  Scarlett and her family arrived in November for an extended vacation in Goa, known for its white sandy beaches and dance music scene. Beachfront shacks house the bars that fuel the nightlife.  MacKeown said Scarlett was left in the care of a trusted male friend and his aunts while the rest of the family traveled to an adjoining Indian state, but she told the BBC that she has had no contact with the family since her daughter's death.  The mother said Monday she sent a letter to Goa's chief minister asking for India's Central Bureau of Investigation to look into the case.  Goa is popular with Western tourists but several tourists have died from drug overdoses in recent years while women have been attacked and sexually assaulted.  The Times Of India said 126 foreigners have died in Goa over the last two years and in January this year a 30-year-old British woman was raped.

{"article": "ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Hundreds of militants, believed to be foreign fighters, launched attacks on various military check posts in Pakistan's border with Afghanistan Saturday night and early Sunday morning, military officials said.  A Pakistan soldier on patrol last fall against militants on the border of the Mohmand agency district.  The ensuing fighting left 40 militants and six Pakistan soldiers dead, said military spokesman Gen. Athar Abbas.  \"This is one of the largest attacks we have seen,\" Abbas said.  The attacks occurred at checkposts and military camps in the Mohmand agency, part of the lawless Federally Administered Tribal Areas where U.S. and Pakistani officials have reported a presence of militants.

In recent months, Afghan officials have blamed militants operating from havens in the lawless tribal regions of Pakistan of sneaking into their country and attacking security personnel.

{"article": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- After touring the wreckage Tuesday of two Metro transit trains that crashed the day before, killing nine, Washington Mayor Adrian Fenty said it was a sight that \"no one should have to see.\"  Investigators work Tuesday at the site of a Metro train crash in Washington.  Officials said that all the wreckage has been cleared and that no other bodies have been found in what was the worst subway train accident in the history of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority.  Three bodies discovered Tuesday were lodged behind the driver's compartment of the rear train, an official said at the scene.  The driver of that train, who was among the dead, was Jeanice McMillan, 42, of Springfield, Virginia, Metro spokeswoman Lisa Farbstein said. McMillan had worked at Metro since January 2007.  McMillan's aunt, Venice Foster, said her niece loved her job and \"was just a joy to be around.\"  Retired Maj. Gen. David F. Wherley Jr., former commanding general of the District of Columbia National Guard, and his wife, Ann, also were killed in the collision. Both were 62.  Names of the other casualties were released by authorities Tuesday afternoon: Mary Doolittle, 59; Lavanda King, 23; Veronica Dubose, 26; Cameron Williams, 36; and Dennis Hawkins, 64, all of Washington; and Ana Fernandez, 40, of Hyattsville, Maryland.  Watch what officials know about the crash \u00bb  The Metro's board approved a $250,000 hardship fund to assist the victims' families with funerals and other immediate expenses.  According to Fenty, at least three bodies were trapped in a \"very compressed area.\" It wasn't clear whether those were the bodies found behind the operator's station.  \"It just brings home what an awful tragedy this was,\" the mayor said.  The crash occurred along the Red Line just before 5 p.m. Monday on an above-ground track in the District of Columbia near Takoma Park, Maryland.  See location of crash \u00bb  Both cars were on the same track, traveling in the same direction: southward from the Fort Totten Metrorail station to the Shady Grove station. The train in front had stopped behind another train undergoing service and awaited directions to move ahead.  \"We don't know at this point whether the operator could see the train in front of her in time to stop,\" said Deborah Hersman, who is leading the investigation for the National Transportation Safety Board.  The weather at the time of the crash was good, she said.  See pictures of crash site \u00bb  \"I did have the opportunity to walk the track with our investigators. I can tell you it is a scene of real devastation,\" Hersman said.  Jamie Jiao was sitting in the front car of the second train. He said he suffered injuries to his feet and back.  \"I see the train in front a split second before we crashed. That's all. You don't have time to react or do anything,\" he told CNN's Jeanne Meserve.  He said that after impact, \"You just hear really loud noises, as if there was an explosion. I could see things falling apart, tearing apart.\"  A pole fell on top of him, but he was able to throw it off. The car broke open, and he crawled outside, where he waited for firefighters. He said he didn't notice whether the driver tried to brake before hitting the other train.  Many of the passengers in his car were injured, he said.  \"I'm lucky to be alive,\" Jiao said. \"My injuries aren't too bad.\" iReport.com: Were you there? Share your photos, video  Hersman said there was a telescoping effect when the second car slammed into the first and landed atop it.  \"The first car [of the second train] overrode the rear car [of the front train], and much of the survivable space on that first car of the striking train was compromised,\" she said.  One of the factors the NTSB will examine is the crash-worthiness of the cars.  \"The safety board has long been on record making recommendations about survivability when accidents do happen to make sure that operators and passengers are protected as much as possible,\" Hersman said, but those haven't been implemented. She didn't elaborate.  The safety board has called since 2006 for the transit authority to modernize its fleet of transit cars. The agency has sought more safety features and higher technology, such as data boxes on each car that can provide valuable information in case of a crash, Hersman said.  Citing the most recent federal data, she said the average age of the cars in the fleet was 19.3 years old.  The lead train in the crash contained 5000-Series and 3000-Series cars, which are newer and have better technology than the cars in the rear train, with 1000-Series cars.  Watch woman say she, fellow passengers \"went flying\" \u00bb  The Metro board is \"aggressively seeking\" to replace 300 1000-Series cars purchased between 1974 and 1978, said Jim Graham, chairman of Metro's board of directors.  There should be nine data recorders aboard the first train, which will aid the investigation a great deal if they aren't damaged, Hersman said. The recorders provide data on such things as speed, braking and emergency applications. She said there were no recorders on the rear train.  \"We've recommended for years that WMATA either retrofit those cars or phase them out of the fleet. They have not been able to do that. And our recommendation was not addressed, so it has been closed in an unacceptable status,\" she said.  \"If there are changes we can make to those cars, we will do so,\" said John Catoe Jr., general manager of the transit authority.  Fenty said 76 people were injured, and two remained in critical condition Tuesday. The condition of another critical patient was upgraded. Two of the injured were emergency responders, Washington Fire Chief Dennis Rubin said.  Watch injured passengers limp from the scene \u00bb  All trains were to operate in manual, instead of automatic, mode Tuesday, Catoe said at the briefing. He called the move \"an extra safety precaution\" until there is more information on the crash.  The rear train was operating on \"automatic\" mode, which is routine during rush hour, and preliminary evidence shows that the driver may have employed the brakes, Hersman said.  Hersman addressed reports that the trains may have been two months past due on brake inspections, saying, \"We are very interested in looking at those records, and we're interested in looking at all of the records.\"  She said cell phone and texting records would also be reviewed, which is standard.  \"We've investigated a number of accidents where there were distractions,\" she said, adding that it's unknown whether cell phone use was a factor in this crash.  Nine safety board teams will examine aspects such as train operations and communications, signals, tracks, crash-worthiness of equipment, maintenance and survivability -- ease of fleeing the trains after the crash and other survivability factors, Hersman said.  The transit authority gave Red Line riders several options for commuting Tuesday morning and was providing free shuttle buses to drive people around the accident scene.  The only other time in Metrorail's 33-year history that there were customer fatalities was in January 1982, when three people died as a result of a derailment between the Federal Triangle and Smithsonian Metrorail stations.

Watch an oil drilling bonanza \u00bb  Spears' church and thousands of residents around the Fort Worth area are cashing in on a unique urban drilling bonanza.  With the development of horizontal drilling technology and with gas prices sky-high, energy companies are racing to tap into the Barnett Shale natural gas field.  The Barnett Shale is the most-productive natural gas field in such a highly populated area spanning 5,000 square miles. The drilling here is being watched closely in Louisiana and Pennsylvania, which also have natural gas fields under urban areas.  See where the Barnett Shale is located \u00bb  Energy companies in the Fort Worth area are going door-to-door, negotiating with people for access to mineral rights under their homes. That means residents are offered a bonus check and future monthly royalty checks.  Spears' church received a $32,000 bonus and receives between $3,000 and $10,000 a month in royalty checks. The money is helping pay for a multimillion-dollar expansion and a new sanctuary.  \"We're making a lot of millionaires up here in the Barnett Shale area,\" said Julie Wilson, vice president of Chesapeake Energy, one of the energy companies drilling wells in the Fort Worth area.  The Fort Worth Chamber of Commerce says the urban drilling craze has created more than 50,000 jobs and will pump nearly $1 billion in tax revenue into the city's economy.  But opponents of this urban drilling say that it shouldn't be done in populated areas and that the promises of many people getting rich aren't true. They say that for most people, the payouts are modest.  How much money residents get depends on how much property they own and how much gas -- if any -- is found. The dollar figure also depends on each resident's negotiating skills with energy companies, experts say. The money can range from a few hundred dollars to tens of thousands.  \"It's a divide and conquer strategy by going around and giving everybody enough money to keep them quiet. Hush money is what I call it,\" said Don Young, a community activist who operates a blog called FWCanDo.org. \"Gas drilling is very dirty; it's very dangerous.\"  To 72-year-old Jerry Horton, the drilling is a threat to her cherished front yard. To move the natural gas through the city, Chesapeake Energy needs to bury a pipeline in her yard. She's been offered almost $13,000, up from the $3,000 she was initially offered.  \"I wouldn't sell my front yard for a million dollars,\" said Horton, a retired artist who has lived in the same house for 53 years.  Chesapeake Energy recently sued Horton for access to her front yard, claiming eminent domain. The company says pipelines are crucial to keep the natural gas flowing and allow people to cash in the profits under the ground.  \"I understand we need to pump our own oil, our own gas,\" Horton said. \"But we don't need to destroy our homes, all of our trees and blow ourselves up. Who's going to be here to enjoy the gas then?\"  Energy companies say that drilling for natural gas is safe and done in an environmentally friendly way. But opponents say the drilling is dangerous and a threat to the environment.  \"Gas drilling... has no business in an urban area. So I don't want to contribute to a company that's doing that to my community,\" said Young, who refused to let his property be used.  While energy companies maintain the drilling is not a threat to homes, some question the impact of drilling beneath neighborhoods. Young and other activists also are concerned about air and water pollution, soil contamination, health and safety issues and the loss of green space and wildlife.  \"We're guinea pigs,\" Young said. \"We're the first large metropolitan area ever to have intense natural gas drilling going on in our neighborhood, right in the heart of the city.\"", "Q": ["Q: What has become widespread across Forth Worth A:", "Q: What does opponent say?

{"article": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- The sole survivor of the crash that killed Princess Diana has told a court he still cannot remember the incident but does not support the conspiracy theories surrounding it.  Bodyguard Trevor Rees and the back of Princess Diana's head are seen shortly before the car crash.  Bodyguard Trevor Rees, formerly known as Trevor Rees-Jones, was the front-seat passenger in the Mercedes that carried Diana, her boyfriend, Dodi Fayed, and their driver, Henri Paul.  He sustained serious injuries in the August 31, 1997 crash and testified that he received anonymous phone calls and letters after the accident, threatening him to keep quiet.  He said the caller told him to keep quiet, saying, \"We know who you are, we know where you are, and we know where you live.\"  Rees said he didn't take the calls or letters seriously.  A lawyer also asked Rees about a supposed encounter with a woman in which he told her, \"If I remember, they're going to kill me.\" Rees said he didn't recall the conversation and found it unlikely he ever made the remark.  Rees, who still has a visible scar from the accident over his left eye, told the court he remembers nothing new about the crash, which, he has said, was an accident.  He has said the last thing he remembers that night was leaving the Ritz Hotel in Paris, and that his next memory is more than a week later, in his hospital bed, when his parents told him everyone else in the car was dead.  Rees suffered major injuries to his lower jaw, the base of his brain, and his pulmonary system and has had several surgeries and hospitalizations, some of which al Fayed paid for.  Rees also testified that he did not support the allegations by Dodi Fayed's father, Mohamed al Fayed, that British security services were behind the crash. He denied the security services paid him to change his story.  At the time of the crash, Rees was working for al Fayed's security team and was assigned to guard Dodi Fayed. He was also protecting the princess because she was Fayed's companion on the trip.  He no longer works on al Fayed's security team. Rees has said what was once a good relationship with his former employer has broken down, largely because he does into support al Fayed's conspiracy theories about the crash.  \"I am not a part of any conspiracy to suppress the truth at all,\" Rees testified. \"All I have ever done is given the truth as I see it.\"  In 2000, Rees published a book, \"The Bodyguard's Story: Diana, the Crash, and the Sole Survivor,\" offering his account of the events surrounding the crash. He said al Fayed tried unsuccessfully to stop the book's publication in England.  Rees told CNN he wrote the book to give a definitive account of what he remembered and knew, but also to counter al Fayed's accusations that his unprofessionalism caused the accident. Rees also said proceeds from the book helped pay his legal bills.  During the morning session, Rees testified that he had two flashbacks in the months after the crash, but his psychiatrist told him they were false memories.  In the first, Rees said, he recalled hearing the voice of a woman -- apparently Diana -- calling out, \"Dodi\" from the back seat of the car. In the second flashback, Rees said he recalled seeing a paparazzi motorbike next to the car.  Lawyer Ian Burnett then read from a letter written by Al Fayed to Lord Stevens, who investigated the crash for the British police. In the letter, Al Fayed says Rees is lying about losing his memory.  \"He knows the detail which the security services are so eager to suppress,\" Al Fayed wrote, alluding to his belief that the crash was part of a murder plot.  Rees testified that he was not lying about his memory loss: \"I have no memory of -- after leaving the back of the hotel, that's my last true memory.\"  Rees also said claims the couple visited a jeweler's in Monte Carlo to buy an engagement ring in late August 1997 were untrue.  British authorities hold an inquest whenever someone dies in suspicious circumstances. A judge, who is also called a coroner, holds hearings to determine how the person died, but he will not determine blame or apportion guilt.  Although Diana and Dodi Fayed died in Paris, a British coroner must still investigate because their bodies were returned to Britain. The inquest does not involve driver Henri Paul because his body remained in France.  British authorities had to wait to begin the inquest until after French authorities concluded their investigation, which lasted from August 1997 to late 2003. The inquest then began but immediately adjourned so that British police could do their own report, which was needed for the British inquest.  The British police inquiry took almost three years and concluded in December 2006. The inquest then resumed in October 2007 and is expected to last four to six months.

{"article": "London (CNN) -- Singer Amy Winehouse's death this summer was the result of alcohol poisoning, an inquest ruled Wednesday, as it reached a verdict of \"death by misadventure.\"  A pathologist told a coroner's court in north London that alcohol toxicity was the cause of the 27-year-old's death, with her blood-alcohol levels measured at more than five times the legal limit for driving.  The Grammy award-winning artist, who had battled with alcohol and drug abuse over several years, was found dead at her north London home July 23.  Testimony at her inquest showed no traces of illegal drugs in Winehouse's system -- but more details emerged about her losing battle with alcohol.  Winehouse's physician, Dr. Christina Romete, said she saw Winehouse at 7 p.m. the day before she died, when the singer was tipsy but still able to hold a conversation.  Asked when she was going to stop drinking, Winehouse replied that she would call Romete over the weekend to discuss it, the physician said.  Winehouse was determined to do things her own way, including therapy, Romete said, but was aware of the risks of alcohol abuse.  The singer's personal security guard, Andrew Morris, said he last spoke to her at 2 a.m. on July 23. He said he looked in on her at 10 a.m. and saw her lying on her bed, but figured she was sleeping in, which wasn't unusual, the court heard.  Morris said he realized something was wrong when he checked in again at 3 p.m. and saw Winehouse had not moved. She wasn't breathing and had no pulse, he said.  Morris said the singer didn't \"drink to get drunk,\" but that he noticed she had started drinking alcohol again that week.  Police who searched the flat after her death found three empty vodka bottles, the inquest heard.  The pathologist's tests revealed that Winehouse's blood-alcohol level was 416 milligrams per 100 milliliters of blood. The level considered lethal is 350 milligrams per 100 milliliters of blood, and the legal limit to drive in Britain is 80 milligrams of alcohol.  The pathologist found no traces of tablets in Winehouse's stomach and said her organs appeared to be normal.  The verdict of misadventure means that it is judged to be an accidental death in which no law was broken or criminal negligence involved.  A family statement, given by spokesman Chris Goodman, said: \"It is (with) some relief we finally found out what happened to Amy.  \"We understand there was alcohol in her system when she passed away. It is likely a buildup of alcohol in her system over a number of days.  \"The court heard that Amy was battling hard to conquer her problems with alcohol and it is a source of great pain that she could not win in time. She had started drinking again that week after a period of abstinence,\" Goodman said.  Winehouse's father Mitch and mother Janet were among those who packed the small courtroom at St. Pancras Coroners Court to hear the evidence from key witnesses.  Her family set up the Amy Winehouse Foundation last month to raise money to help young people in Britain and elsewhere, especially those suffering the effects of ill health, disability, poverty and addiction.  Goodman said the ruling \"underlines how important our work with the Amy Winehouse Foundation is to us to help as many young people and children we can in her name.\"  Winehouse's family said in August that toxicology tests had found that \"no illegal substances\" were in her system at the time of her death but alcohol was present.  The singer's soulful, throaty vocals brought her stardom in 2007, but her troubled off-stage life -- chronicled in her top 10 hit \"Rehab\" -- won her notoriety.  Her death came less than two months after her latest release from a rehabilitation program and weeks after she was booed offstage by disappointed fans in Serbia.  The tattooed London-born singer-songwriter's first album, \"Frank,\" debuted in 2003, when she was 19.  International success came with her 2007 album \"Back to Black.\" She dominated the 2008 Grammys, winning five awards that night and delivering, via satellite from London, a strong performance of \"Rehab.\"  Mitch Winehouse has said he plans to write a memoir, called \"Amy: My Daughter,\" to be released next summer, which he said would tell the story of the Amy that the public never got to know.", "Q": ["Q: Who recounted details of Winehouse's last hours?

{"article": "ARBIL, Iraq (CNN) -- Two United Arab Emirates based companies announced on Tuesday that they will be investing in the Iraq's autonomous region of Kurdistan.  Nechirvan Barzani, Prime Minister of the Kurdish Regional Government, called the project \"a significant contribution to the Iraqi economy.\"  Four hundred and sixty one million square feet have been officially assigned to \"Gas Cities LLC,\" a joint venture between Dana Gas and Crescent Petroleum, both Sharjah-based companies, to establish a new venture: \"Kurdistan Gas City.\"  Kurdistan Gas City will include industrial, residential and commercial buildings in an integrated city. The expected initial investment in basic infrastructure is estimated at $3 billion, with further foreign direct investment exceeding $40 billion during the operations phase.  Work will start on the project, which is designed to promote private sector investment in a variety of gas-related industries, on September 21.  Gas City is structured to hold over 20 varieties of world scale petrochemical and heavy manufacturing plants, and hundreds of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), served by state-of-the-art facilities.  Mr Nechirvan Barzani, Prime Minister of the Kurdistan Regional Government, said: \"Dana Gas and Crescent Petroleum have made a significant contribution to the Iraqi economy through their work in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq thus far, we are making significant progress in spurring on economic growth and creating opportunity for our people.\"  Hamid Jafar, Executive Chairman of Dana Gas, explained the importance of this achievement saying: \"The Kurdistan Gas City is an enormous step forward in Dana Gas' strategy across the Middle East, North Africa and South Asia.\"  The Kurdistan Gas City is projected to generate job opportunities for nearly 200,000 Iraqi citizens in infrastructure, industrial projects, support services and other business activities.  This is not the first project for Dana Gas and Crescent Petroleum in Iraq's Kurdistan Region, the two companies are committed to a service agreement signed in April 2007 with the Kurdistan Regional Government to build 180 kilometers of natural gas pipeline and two liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) plants, which are 80 percent complete.  The project is on track and will start pumping 150 million cubic feet of gas per day in the coming weeks, rising to 300 million cubic feet by early 2009.

{"article": " -- When animal rights activist Jasmin Singer found herself face to face with a scientist who conducts animal testing, a cupcake was exchanged instead of harsh words.  \"A good vegan cupcake has the power to transform everything for the better,\" Singer said. \"It's almost like a political statement with icing.\"  Singer was co-hosting a vegan bake sale in New York last week as part of the second annual Worldwide Vegan Bake Sale. More than 120 groups across six continents are holding vegan bake sales from April 24 through May 2.  Bake sale participants see the sweet treats as a way to introduce those unfamiliar with a vegan diet to some of the flavorful foods they can eat.  While vegetarians stay away from meat but may consume dairy and eggs, vegans give up all animal products.  Some people become vegan for animal welfare reasons. Others view it as a way to reduce their carbon footprint. Still others choose the plant-based diet as part of a healthier lifestyle.  Ruxandra Costescu, of Bucharest, Romania, said most attendees at the bake sales she helped organize weren't vegan.  One person who showed up couldn't decide what he wanted, so he took one of everything, she said, adding that he came back later to buy more of his favorites for his family.  \"It's really nice to have people who eat anything really appreciate the vegan treats,\" Costescu said. \"Usually people are amazed that they're so tasty.\"  In Sydney, Australia, Amanda Salles was inspired to start regularly holding vegan bake sales after joining the first worldwide bake sale last year.  She has never gone to an animal rights rally, but she tries to make a difference by baking vegan desserts like gingerbread cookies.  \"I know a lot of people probably think it's not enough or that you should be going to protests or demonstrations,\" she said. \"But it's a good way to participate. It's not very aggressive.\"  Some approaches to vegan outreach are less subtle. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals has had half-naked activists campaign against meat consumption by covering themselves in fake blood and lying in human-sized meat packages.  PETA's theatrics may seem a far cry from a bake sale, but the organization sees the sales and protests as means of reaching the same goal.  \"Even if [people] don't like the medium that we're using to get things across, we really just try to make sure they understand why we're doing it,\" said PETA senior campaigner Ashley Byrne.  Gary Loewenthal, director of the Worldwide Vegan Bake Sale, said he believes bake sales can be a nice change of pace for people used to more confrontational forms of activism.  \"I liked it because it combined this time-honored, well-liked tradition with vegan outreach,\" he said.  He started planning last year's event from his home in Falls Church, Virginia, after brainstorming fundraising opportunities with Compassion for Animals, the animal advocacy group he helps run.  Loewenthal sent invitations to cities all over the world and soon generated a buzz online. In 2009, the event had close to 100 participants and raised more than $25,000.  Each group decides where to direct the proceeds of its own bake sale. While the money is not required to go to any specific type of organization, many opt to donate to nonprofit groups.  Two events in Seattle, Washington, last week raised $1,770 for Pigs Peace Sanctuary, where Edgar, a potbellied pig, is being treated for a broken leg.  Funds from a vegan bake sale in California on Sunday will benefit breast cancer research and education through the Avon Foundation. A group in Louisiana will send its proceeds to Food For Life, a vegan hunger-relief organization.  When Loewenthal started researching vegan bake sales in 2008, a Google search yielded few results. Now, he says, one can find at least a handful of them taking place in any given month.  In late January, more than 25 U.S. cities held vegan bake sales to raise money for Haiti hurricane relief. They were able to donate more than $75,000, according to organizer Isa Moskowitz, author of a number of vegan cookbooks.  The growing popularity of vegan bake sales makes Loewenthal think about the future of the Worldwide Vegan Bake Sale.  \"We've got some ideas going forward about how to keep it fresh,\" he said. \"But we're also prepared for it to be obsolete.... We can call it a success and go on to something else.\"", "Q": ["Q: What the activist animal rights says? A:", "Q: When does the sale run? A:", "Q: How many groups there are about?

{"article": " -- Around 204,000 people have fled their homes in the Somali capital of Mogadishu as a result of a militant offensive against government forces, the U.N. refugee agency said on Tuesday.  Islamist fighters exchange gunfire with government forces in Mogadishu on July 3.  The eight-week long push by Al-Shaabab and Hisb-ul-Islam militias has prompted what the agency calls \"the biggest exodus from the troubled Somali capital since the Ethiopian intervention in 2007.\"  \"The escalating conflict in Mogadishu is having a devastating impact on the city's population causing enormous suffering and massive displacement,\" the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said.  The agency said its local partners in the capital reported that fighting over the past week \"has killed some 105 people and injured 382.\"  \"Neighborhoods affected by the fighting include Kaaran, Shibis, Shangaani and Boondheere in North Mogadishu. These areas have hitherto been islands of peace, escaping much of the conflict and destruction. Many residents are fleeing their homes for the first time since the start of the Somali civil war in 1991,\" the agency said.  The agency said the number of internally displaced people in Somalia amounts to more than 1.2 million people.  There has been growing concern that Somalia, in the Horn of Africa, could be the next base for al Qaeda as U.S. forces pound their positions in Afghanistan and Pakistan.  Last month, a U.S. State Department spokesman said the United States is providing weapons and ammunition to Somalia's transitional government as it fights al Qaeda-linked Islamist militants.  CIA Director Leon Panetta recently said that the intelligence agency is keeping tabs on the region as a possible destination for fleeing al Qaeda operatives.  \"Our concern right now is that likely safe havens are areas in the Horn of Africa, like Somalia and Yemen, that are countries that because of their political status can be attractive to al Qaeda in order to operate there,\" Panetta said earlier this month.  Al-Shaabab, also known as the Mujahideen Youth Movement, was officially designated as a terrorist organization by the United States in March 2008.

{"article": " -- A family friend of a U.S. soldier captured by the Taliban said his friends and family want Pfc. Bowe Bergdahl to \"stand tall, stand firm.\"  Pfc. Bowe Bergdahl in a video made by his captors, members of the Taliban.  \"Bowe, if you see this, know that we love you and we are praying fervently for you and prayers are going up for you from all over the world,\" Tim Baker told CNN affiliate KTVB-TV in the soldier's hometown of Ketchum, Idaho.  \"To all of our valiant men and women, know that the American people believe in you, support you and are 100 percent behind you, and we thank God every day that you have our back.\"  In a video released Sunday, apparently made by his captors, Bergdahl spoke of being \"scared I won't be able to go home.\"  \"It breaks our heart,\" Baker said. \"It's like having one of our own kids in this situation.\"  Watch friend's comments about Taliban captive \u00bb  The Bergdahl family is not speaking with media, but Baker said prayer is helping. \"Prayer means that we are extremely powerful because God is not limited by where we are when we pray. He is there with Bowe, and so we know that he is protecting him and is with him, so we don't feel powerless against these people,\" Baker said. \"We feel very empowered.\"  Bergdahl, 23, was captured June 30 from Paktika province in southeastern Afghanistan, according to the Department of Defense.  The Taliban has threatened to kill Bergdahl if foreign troops continue targeting civilians in the name of search operations in Ghazni and Paktika provinces, Taliban commander Mulvi Sangeen said by telephone Friday after being contacted by CNN at an undisclosed location.  NATO-led forces in Afghanistan and the U.S. military have repeatedly denied targeting civilians.  U.S. forces in Afghanistan are doing everything possible to free Bergdahl, Defense Secretary Robert Gates said Monday.  Gates and Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told a news conference they were disgusted at the video that Bergdahl's captors released.  \"My personal reaction was one of disgust at the exploitation of this young soldier,\" Gates said.  In the 28-minute video, Bergdahl becomes emotional when he speaks of his family -- his parents, siblings, nieces and nephew -- and the girlfriend he hopes to marry.  \"I have a very, very good family that I love back home in America, and I miss them every day that I'm gone,\" he says. \"I miss them, and I'm afraid I might never see them again and that I'll never be able to tell them I love them again. I'll never be able to hug them.  \"I'm scared I won't be able to go home. It is very unnerving to be a prisoner,\" he said. However, his captors are treating him \"like a guest,\" he said.  Asked by his captors if he had any message for Americans, the soldier said, \"To my fellow Americans who have loved ones over here, who know what it's like to miss them, you have the power to make our government bring them home. Please, please bring us home so we can be back where we belong and not over here.\"  It was not clear whether some or all of Bergdahl's remarks were scripted by his captors.  Watch excerpt from the video \u00bb  The last few minutes of the video show him eating a meal.  The Bergdahl family expressed how they are feeling to Blaine County Sheriff Walt Femling. \"We've been overwhelmed with the outpouring of support and concern towards Bowe and our family. As you know, the situation is extremely difficult for everyone involved. We'd like to remind all of you our sole focus is seeing our beloved son Bowe safely home.  \"Please continue to keep Bowe in your thoughts and prayers, and we ask for your continued acceptance of our need for privacy in this difficult situation. Thank you.\"  A reporter asked Femling if the military has restricted anything he has said and he answered that it has not.  The Taliban earlier claimed responsibility for Bergdahl's kidnapping, the military said. Last week, the U.S. military distributed pamphlets in eastern Afghanistan in an effort to locate him.  \"As you can see, the American soldier is in good shape and good health, and he is being treated well based on the guidelines of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan regarding war prisoners,\" said a statement on Islamist Web sites accompanying the video. \"Any decision regarding the American soldier will be the specialty of the high order of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, may God protect him.\"  The U.S. military said it believed Bergdahl may have been moved to various locations. In the video, Bergdahl's captor makes reference to his being moved from Paktika to Khandahar, saying the move was accomplished \"very easily.\" The claim could not be independently verified. Asked the date by his captor, Bergdahl says it is July 14.  Two versions of the pamphlets were distributed in Afghanistan, written in the Pashto language. They were made available to CNN by U.S. forces in Afghanistan.  One shows the image of an American soldier shaking hands with a group of kids with the message, \"One of our American guests is missing. Return the guest to his home. Call us at\" -- and lists a phone number.  The other shows a U.S. soldier kicking down a door, and then an outstretched hand with the superimposed image of a soldier, his head and arms drooping, and the words, \"If you do not release the U.S. soldier then... you will be hunted.\"  The goal of the pamphlets was to balance the effort to get Bergdahl back with how U.S. forces interact with the local population, Gates and Mullen said Monday. Mullen said the message of the second pamphlet was \"not threatening, but to express that we will do what we have to do to find this individual.\"  Days after Bergdahl went missing, a senior U.S. military official said Bergdahl was captured by low-level militants and then quickly \"sold\" to the clan and network led by warlord Siraj Haqqani, who is believed to be deeply involved in the action.  The Haqqani clan operates on both sides of the Afghan-Pakistani border and is well known to the U.S. military.  Bergdahl apparently left his small outpost on his own on June 30 with no apparent means of defending himself, the official said. Taliban commander Mulvi Sangeen said he visited a military post in the Yousaf Khel district in the Paktika province, got drunk and was ambushed while returning to his car.  Sangeen said the soldier was taken to a safe place. CNN could not independently verify Sangeen's claims.  A source with the U.S. military denied the claim that Bergdahl was drunk. \"The Taliban are known for lying and what they are claiming [is] not true,\" the source said.  In the video, Bergdahl says he was captured as he was lagging behind a patrol.  Bergdahl is not a National Guardsman, according to the Idaho National Guard statement, but the organization said it was coordinating with the Department of Defense to provide public affairs duties and other assistance to the Bergdahl family. The family has requested privacy, the statement said.  On Monday, four U.S. troops with the International Security Assistance Force were killed in eastern Afghanistan, according to a senior U.S. official there. The deaths would raise the total of U.S. military fatalities in Afghanistan to 30 in July, the highest monthly toll since the war began in October 2001. According to the security force, the four were killed in a roadside bombing.

{"article": "MADRID, Spain (CNN)  -- Unemployment in Spain has reached 20 percent, meaning 4.6 million people are out of work, the Spanish government announced Friday.  The figure, from the first quarter, is up from 19 percent and 4.3 million people in the previous quarter. It represents the second-highest unemployment rate in the European Union, after Latvia, according to figures Friday from Eurostat, the EU's statistics service.  Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero told Parliament on Wednesday he believes the jobless rate has peaked and will now start to decline.  The first quarter of the year is traditionally poor for Spain because of a drop in labor-intensive activity like construction, agriculture and tourism.  This week, Standard & Poor's downgraded Spain's long-term credit rating and said the outlook is negative.  \"We now believe that the Spanish economy's shift away from credit-fuelled economic growth is likely to result in a more protracted period of sluggish activity than we previously assumed,\" Standard & Poor's credit analyst Marko Mrsnik said.  Gross domestic product growth in Spain is expected to average 0.7 percent annually through 2016, compared with previous expectations of 1 percent annually, he said.  Spain's economic problems are closely tied to the housing bust there, according to The Economist magazine. Many of the newly unemployed worked in construction, it said.  The recession revealed how dependent public finances were on housing-related tax revenues, it said.  Another problem in Spain is that wages are set centrally and most jobs are protected, making it hard to shift skilled workers from one industry to another, the magazine said.  Average unemployment for the 27-member European Union stayed stable in March at 9.6 percent, Eurostat said Friday. That percentage represents 23 million people, it said.  The lowest national unemployment rates were in the Netherlands and Austria, which had 4.1 and 4.9 percent respectively, Eurostat said.  -- CNN's Al Goodman contributed to this report.", "Q": ["Q: What country's unemployment rate is highest in Europe?

{"article": "  -- Former Argentina international defender Fernando Caceres is fighting for his life in a Buenos Aires hospital after being shot in the head during an armed robbery.  The 40-year-old Caceres, who played for Argentina in the 1994 World Cup, was gunned down as a gang tried to steal his BMW car in the early hours of Sunday morning.  A bullet has reportedly entered his head through his right eye, and he remains in a coma in a grave condition.  Caceres was visited by his former Boca Juniors teammate and national coach Diego Maradona, who clearly distressed, told reporters outside the hospital that crime was rife in the Argentine capital.  \"This is a time bomb, going out is a constant danger,\" Maradona told television station TyCSports.  \"This happens every day, nobody does anything and something must be done.  \"Caceres is in the hands of God and I hope it helps,\" Maradona added.  The attack happened in the Fort Apache area of Buenos Aires, which is where Manchester City star Carlos Tevez grew up, and is notorious for high crime levels.  Players from two of his former clubs, Argentinos Juniors and Independiente displayed a banner of support for him ahead of their later match in the Argentine league on Sunday.  Caceres won the league title with River Plate in 1991 and the European Cup Winners Cup with Spanish side Real Zaragoza in 1995.  He played 24 games for Argentina, helping them to the Copa America in 1993 before appearing at the World Cup finals in the United States a year later.

{"article": "(The Frisky) -- Don't you just hate the type of person who smugly informs you, \"I don't watch TV,\" like that's something to be proud of? They think they're so great with all their fancy book learning.  What they don't realize is that TV isn't for dummies -- there's tons of educational programming available -- you just need to know what to watch. I mean, you can learn your ABCs with \"Sesame Street's\" Grover, how to make gnocchi with Mario Batali, and the ins and outs of prettying up your home with any number of programs on HGTV.  Television is also a great romance resource. Think of all the great TV twosomes we've seen over the years -- Lucy & Ricky Ricardo, Judy & George Jetson, Spencer Pratt and Heidi Montag... but not all TV personalities set such a sincerely loving example. It's also a good place to learn which type of guy you should avoid.  Here are a few examples:  Chuck Bass (\"Gossip Girl\"): Few men can pull off lavender argyle, but Chuck Bass is definitely one of them. Moody and sinister, when Chuck Bass Types (CBTs) like you, it's as though you've been inducted into a secret society of two.  It's you against the world and the CBT will bring out a dark side you might not have even realized you possessed. Whip smart with a caustic wit, he'll charm you all the while tucking away your secrets for use at a later date. And use them he will. Because when a CBT tires of you, he won't just say \"see ya,\" he'll decimate you.  Hank Moody (\"Californication\"): Some boys take longer than usual to grow out of their Charles Bukowski-wannabe phase. Exhibit A is Hank Moody. Actor David Duchovny, playing what the tabloids would have you believe is an autobiographical role, has managed to hang onto his Bukowski-phase well into his forties. Drinking, partying, and resisting monogamy, Hank still manages to attract more ladies than hotter men half his age.  Of course the only women drawn to Hank are either damaged girls with daddy issues or the type of dame who doesn't feel complete unless she has some mess to clean up after. If you see yourself dating a Hank Moody type, do not walk -- run -- to your nearest mental health professional.  Vince Chase (\"Entourage\"): Those big blue eyes and that floppy mop o' hair...  you can forgive him for making a stinker like \"Medellin,\" can't you? Sure, but do you really want to deal with someone who lives in a dude cocoon? Not only does he live with his brother and two best friends, he can't make any decisions without polling the group.  On the upside, he's rich! On the downside, he's famous, which means other women are throwing themselves at him constantly. Vince might be fun for a fling, but forget about bringing him home to mama.  Don Draper (\"Mad Men\"): Why is it when unattractive people are quiet we just assume they're stupid and/or boring, but verbally challenged hot people get pegged as mysterious and smoldering?  Mad Men's smokin' hot Don Draper actually is mysterious (and smoldering!), so I don't know what point I was trying to make (because I'm all distracted from the photos on his IMDB page)... oh, wait! The point I'm trying to make is that while Draper is indeed mysterious, he's also a liar, a cheat and a cad. So if a DDT tries to slip you his number, just say no and send it to me. What?

{"article": " -- Two Russian bombers have landed at a Venezuelan airfield, from which they will carry out training flights for several days, the Russian Defense Ministry said Wednesday.  Russia's Tupolev TU-160, pictured here in 2003, is a long-range strategic bomber.  The Tupolev Tu-160 strategic bombers landed at Venezuela's Libertador military airfield and \"will spend several days carrying out training flights over neutral waters, after which they will return to the base,\" Interfax reported, citing the Russian Defense Ministry.  Col. Alexander Drobyshevsky, a ministry spokesman, told Interfax that NATO fighters followed the bombers on their 13-hour flight over the Arctic Ocean and the Atlantic.  \"All flights by air force aircraft have been and are marked by strict conformity to the international rules on the use of air space over neutral waters,\" Drobyshevsky told Interfax.  The U.S. will monitor the Russian training, said Pentagon officials who asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak on the information.  On Monday, Russia announced it might hold joint naval maneuvers with Venezuela in the Caribbean. The declaration came in the wake of increased tension between Russia and the United States over Russia's invasion last month of the former Soviet republic of Georgia, a U.S. ally that aspires to join NATO.  Russia on Monday denied any link between that announcement and the conflict in Georgia, although Russia has criticized U.S. support for Georgia, and Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has long antagonized Washington.  Earlier this month, Chavez said Venezuela would welcome the Russian air force, according to Russian news agency Novosti.  \"If Russian long-range bombers should need to land in Venezuela, we would not object to that either. We will also welcome them,\" Chavez said on September 1, according to Novosti.  CNN's Mike Mount contributed to this story.", "Q": ["Q: Who followed the bombers? A:", "Q: What did Interfax report?

{"article": "(Entertainment Weekly) -- After all the anticipation and hubbub, the weekend is coming to an end and the box office results are here: \"Watchmen\" (No. 1) grossed $55.7 million during its first frame, according to early estimates from Media by Numbers.  \"Watchmen\" led the weekend box office, grossing $55.7 million during its first weekend.  That's a solid sum, to be sure, although it's certainly on the low end of most projections. \"Watchmen\" premiered in more theaters (3,611) than any other R-rated movie in history, and it averaged an impressive $15,413 per venue, despite a potentially problematic long running time.  It also scored the biggest debut of 2009 so far. Nonetheless, the movie's $55.7 million take (including $5.5 million from 124 IMAX screens) is substantially smaller than the $70.9 million that 300, the last R-rated graphic-novel movie from director Zack Snyder, earned on its opening weekend two years ago.  And aside from that theater-count statistic (which almost any film could break at any time, really), there will be no major records to report on this weekend (for example, \"Watchmen's\" debut was just the fifth-best opening ever for an R-rated movie).  I'd argue, in fact, that this opening is a bit soft, considering the great expectations that came with Snyder's adaptation of Alan Moore's landmark comic book -- not to mention \"Watchmen's\" hefty grosses from screenings at midnight on Friday and throughout its first day. After attracting some major initial interest, banking $25.1 million on Friday, the film's audience dropped off dramatically during the weekend: It grossed $19 million on Saturday and is expected to bring in just $11.5 million on Sunday.  These are all big numbers, don't get me wrong, but, when combined with the fact that the film got a lukewarm CinemaScore grade of B from an audience that was largely comprised of older men, it all points to a rapid downward trend that may be difficult to reverse in the weeks to come.  Elsewhere -- yes, there were other movies playing at the multiplex this weekend! -- a number of films continued to do what \"Watchmen\" must now aspire to, perhaps in vain: They stayed strong deep into their long runs.  Tyler Perry's \"Madea Goes to Jail\" (No. 2) grossed $8.8 million on its third weekend; the film, Perry's biggest yet at the box office, has banked $76.5 million to date.  \"Taken\" (No. 3) also moved along like the unstoppable force it has been for more than a month now, earning $7.5 million and bringing its six-week sum to $118 million.  Best Picture winner \"Slumdog Millionaire\" (No. 4) was next with $6.9 million, which boosted its domestic haul to $125.4 million. And \"Paul Blart: Mall Cop\" (No. 5) took its eight-week total to $133.6 million thanks to another $4.2 million gross. iReport.com: What did you think of 'Watchmen'?  Meanwhile, \"Jonas Brothers: The 3D Concert Experience\" (No. 9) completely fell off the map, dropping a staggering 78 percent to gross just $2.8 million. According to Box Office Mojo, that's the 15th biggest second-weekend decline of all time.  Overall, the cumulative box office was up nearly 8 percent over the same frame a year ago, when 10,000 B.C. opened big, making this the fifth consecutive \"up\" weekend at the multiplex.

{"article": "Washington (CNN) -- The Federal Aviation Administration is changing a generations-old policy banning pilots from taking antidepressants, saying the new policy will improve safety by bringing to the surface pilots who either ignore signs of depression or lie about their use of medication for fear of losing their licenses to fly.  Beginning Monday, pilots with mild to moderate depression will be allowed to fly while taking antidepressants if they can demonstrate they have been satisfactorily treated for at least 12 months.  The FAA also will begin a six-month amnesty period, during which pilots who use antidepressants can step forward without fear of penalties. The pilots will be grounded until they can demonstrate they have been stable for a year, although those who can prove a history of successful medical treatment should be able to fly \"within a few months,\" the FAA said.  The new policy will \"absolutely\" improve safety, said Randy Babbitt, head of the FAA and a former airline pilot and union chief.  \"The concern that we have today is we have people who are either self-medicating or not seeking a diagnosis. Either of those is unacceptable,\" Babbitt said. \"This change... will allow those people to get the treatment, allow us to monitor and return them to the cockpit [as] safer, better pilots.\"  FAA officials said that they do not know the extent of depression among pilots but that pilots are probably representative of the larger population, in which 10 percent are believed to suffer from depression.  Nor does the FAA know how many pilots have removed themselves from flying status because they suffer from depression, a condition that now bars them from flying. Nor do they know how many take antidepressants in violation of FAA policy.  Commercial pilots under the age of 40 are required to undergo a medical exam by an FAA-certified physician every year; those over 40, every six months. But the examination focuses largely on the pilots' physical health, and there is no formal assessment of the pilots' mental health.  The FAA says pilots have a regulatory duty and professional responsibility to not fly if they know they have a physical or mental condition that makes them unsafe to fly.  But the FAA concedes pilots aren't always forthcoming, especially if honesty could cost them their job.  \"We know that there are people out there who are not taking antidepressants because they know they would be grounded if they are. We know there are people out there who are taking them and lying to us about that,\" said Dr. Fred Tilton, the FAA's federal air surgeon.  \"We think it's safer to [make sure pilots are treated for depression] than to continue to drive it underground,\" he said.  Under the new policy, the FAA will, on a case-by-case basis, issue special medical certificates to pilots who take one of four antidepressants: fluoxetine (Prozac), sertraline (Zoloft), citalopram (Celexa) and escitalopram (Lexapro).  All four drugs can be used safely without side effects, the FAA said, and other medications will be considered as the agency gains experience and data under its new policy.  FAA officials say that they have been studying the issue for a decade, and that the change comes with improvements in medication and as the stigma of depression has diminished.  One of the concerns is the risk of suicide by airplane.  Between 1993 and 2002, there were 16 \"aircraft-assisted suicides,\" according to a National Transportation Safety Board report, as recounted in a recent FAA medical bulletin. All involved smaller aircraft.  In addition, the NTSB ruled that in 1999, the pilot caused the crash of EgyptAir Flight 990 by forcing the plane into the Atlantic Ocean, although the board could not determine the pilot's motives and did not use the term \"suicide.\"  The pilot's medical certificate had been renewed 10 days before the crash. All 217 on board were killed.  \"Depression is a disease, and it's treatable just like any other disease. And there is a stigma out there that we want to remove. We want to make the skies safer, and we believe that this change in the policy will benefit that and achieve that,\" Babbitt said.  Said Tilton: \"We believe it's the right thing to do. We also have support from all of the scientific organizations that understand the treatment of depression and the safety of the airspace.\"  The new policy is consistent with recommendations from a host of aviation and medical organizations, including the Aerospace Medical Association, the International Civil Aviation Organization, the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association and the Air Line Pilots Association, the FAA said.  Babbitt acknowledged that pilots face some risk by stepping forward, but he said they also face risk if they don't.  \"If it [unauthorized use of medication] was ever discovered, it would be the end of their license and their career, period,\" he said.  The FAA said the policy is being posted on the Federal Register, where the public can make comments until May 3. Officials said because it is changing a policy, and not a rule, pre-publication in the Federal Register was not necessary.", "Q": ["Q: length of time pilots to be treated A:", "Q: how long is the treatment A:", "Q: what does faa say A:", "Q: pilots must have been treated for at least 12 months for what reason?

{"article": " -- Stratfor, a global intelligence company, has been hacked but it was unclear Monday whether the breach and apparent release of credit card information was the work of the activist hacking group Anonymous.  A posting on the website Pastebin said that Stratfor subscriber data, including information on 4,000 credit cards and the company's \"private client\" list, had been released. The posting cited AntiSec, a Web-based collaboration with the activist hacking groups Anonymous and LulzSec.  U.S.-based Stratfor, which provides independent analysis of international affairs and security threats and describes itself as a publisher of geopolitical analysis, sent an e-mail Sunday to subscribers.  \"On December 24th an unauthorized party disclosed personally identifiable information and related credit card data of some of our members,\" it said. \"We have reason to believe that your personal and credit card data could have been included in the information that was illegally obtained and disclosed.\"  Allen Barr of Austin, Texas, told CNN he was victimized by the misuse of his private information that was hacked from the website before it was posted on websites on the 24th.  A week ago, unauthorized charges totaling $700 were billed to his Visa debit card, he said. The total was charged in increments to a number of charities over the course of about 30 minutes, he said.  But the company quickly identified the transactions as suspicious and called Barr's house, he said. In short order, he had canceled the card, but not before his credit union checking account had been debited, he said. Rectifying that required half a day spent filing police reports and affidavits, he said.  \"Two days later, they said that they would credit back my funds, pending completion of the investigation,\" he added.  Stratfor said the claim that the data included the firm's \"private clients\" was wrong.  \"Contrary to this assertion the disclosure was merely a list of some of the members that have purchased our publications and does not comprise a list of individuals or entities that have a relationship with Stratfor beyond their purchase of our subscription-based publications,\" CEO George Friedman said in an e-mail to members.  The firm provides intelligence reports to subscribers. A recent e-mail discussed political prospects for Iraq.  The information-sharing website Pastebin posted a news release it said was from Anonymous that said the group had nothing to do with the cyberattack on Stratfor.  \"Stratfor is an open-source intelligence agency, publishing daily reports on data collected from the open Internet,\" the posting said. \"Hackers claiming to be Anonymous have distorted this truth in order to further their hidden agenda, and some Anons have taken the bait.\"  \"The leaked client list represents subscribers to a daily publication which is the primary service of Stratfor,\" it continued. \"Stratfor analysts are widely considered to be extremely unbiased. Anonymous does not attack media sources.\"  Stratfor's Friedman said the company is working closely with law enforcement.  \"Stratfor's relationship with its members and, in particular, the confidentiality of their subscriber information, are very important to Stratfor and me,\" he wrote on the firm's Facebook page.  \"We have reason to believe that the names of our corporate subscribers have been posted on other web sites,\" the Austin, Texas, company said. \"We are diligently investigating the extent to which subscriber information may have been obtained.\"  Asked about the hacking, Pentagon spokesman George Little said Sunday that \"Initial indications suggest that there has been no impact\" to the Department of Defense grid.  Stratfor's website was not functioning Monday. A banner read, \"Site is currently undergoing maintenance. Please check back soon.\"  Weekend online postings regarding the Stratfor situation mentioned Army Pfc. Bradley Manning, who served as an intelligence analyst in Iraq. He faces 22 charges related to the leak of nearly 750,000 U.S. military and State Department documents. Most of them ended up on the WikiLeaks website.  \"While the rich and powerful are enjoying themselves with all their bourgeois gifts and lavish meals, our comrade Bradley Manning is not having that great of a time in federal custody,\" said a Pastebin posting. \"Instead of being heralded as a fighter for free information and government transparency, he is criminalized, marginalized, and incarcerated, threatened with life imprisonment.\"  CNN's Barbara Starr contributed to this report.", "Q": ["Q: which of the companies is targeted A:", "Q: Which company is targeted?

{"article": "Belfast, Northern Ireland (CNN) -- Pop superstar Rihanna has been ordered to cover up by a Christian farmer who took exception to her \"inappropriate behavior\" while filming a music video on his land.  The controversy has erupted in Northern Ireland and was even discussed Tuesday by lawmakers in the province's elected Assembly in Belfast.  Rihanna, who was born in Barbados but has Irish ancestry, is in Northern Ireland this week for sold-out shows at Belfast's Odyssey Arena.  The 23-year-old had been given permission to film a video for the song \"We Found Love\" in a muddy barley field owned by farmer Alan Graham outside Bangor, about 10 miles from Belfast.  Graham explained Tuesday, \"I didn't know who was coming. If the name 'Rihanna' had been mentioned, well, no disrespect, but it wouldn't have meant anything.\"  However, he says that when he went to get his tractor Monday and saw the singer stripping down to a bikini top, he stepped in to end the shoot.  The local political representative said he \"asked the film crew to stop, and they did.\"  Graham insisted that \"there were no hard feelings.\"  He added: \"I had a conversation with Rihanna; we shook hands; we parted company on good terms. I found her very gracious, and I hope she understands where I'm coming from. I wish her well.\"  Word had quickly spread of Rihanna's surprise appearance in the Northern Irish countryside, and traffic came to a standstill as fans attempted to catch a glimpse of the star.  Graham's wife shed more light on the incident Tuesday, revealing that Rihanna had gone topless.  Said Mrs. Graham, who declined to give her first name, \"What she was doing became more inappropriate. When she started to go topless, that's what Alan was particularly objecting to -- things were getting out of hand. There was a man as well, and the behavior was getting more inappropriate.... It wasn't the sort of thing Alan wanted young people (those watching) to see on his land. We are Christians.\"  However, Mrs. Graham added: \"The girl was very nice; she shook hands with Alan several times\" after he asked for the filming to stop.  Not to be deterred, Rihanna was back filming again in Belfast on Tuesday.  But the controversy of the sexy shoot in the barley field rumbled on -- and even made it onto the agenda at the Northern Ireland Assembly.  Graham is a local representative with the pro-British Democratic Unionist Party (formerly led by Protestant preacher the Rev. Ian Paisley), and the Rihanna row led to a light-hearted exchange between lawmakers in the Northern Ireland Assembly on Tuesday.  Mike Nesbitt, of rival pro-British party the Ulster Unionists, addressed Democratic Unionist leader Peter Robinson, Northern Ireland's first minister.  Nesbitt said, \"I wonder if the first minister has had an opportunity to assess the potential damage from the news that the pop icon Rihanna was foiled in her filming ambitions yesterday, which I believe were no more sinister than appearing in a field in red, white and blue.\" (The latter are the colors of the British flag as well as the American one).  Robinson replied, \"I'm pretty sure there was no problem with the colors involved!\"  Robinson had just been telling the Assembly of his recent trade mission to the United States to encourage Hollywood studios to make more movies in Northern Ireland.", "Q": ["Q: What does the farmers wife say Rihanna did?

{"article": "London (CNN) -- A Claude Monet pastel drawing of London's Waterloo Bridge has gone on display in the Savoy hotel room where it was created 110 years ago.  Monet drew the bridge across the Thames during a stay in room 618 at the hotel -- now known as the Monet Suite -- in January 1901.  He had intended to paint the view from his balcony in oils, but his art supplies and canvases were delayed on their way from his home in France.  On Monday, the picture -- one of 26 pastel views of the river created by the impressionist -- returned, albeit temporarily. It will be exhibited at the hotel until December 16.  \"Since opening in 1889, the Savoy has played host to numerous artists, such as Whistler and Picasso,\" said manager Kiaran MacDonald.  \"However Monet's views of the Thames are without doubt the most celebrated works of art associated with the hotel.\"  The picture is the only one of Monet's pastels of the river not in a museum collection. It is currently owned by a private gallery, Trinity House, and is for sale for a reported $2.32m.  Monet (1840-1926) lived in London during the Franco-Prussian War in 1870-71, and visited the city on several other occasions, in order to depict its buildings through the then-famous fog.  \"London would be quite ugly if it was not for the fog,\" he wrote in a letter from the Savoy on an earlier stay in 1900.", "Q": ["Q: what bridge did Monet draw?

{"article": "KILLEEN, Texas (CNN)  -- Spc. Logan Burnette arrived at Fort Hood, Texas, a week ago Wednesday to prepare for an upcoming tour of Iraq. The following day, he, like all deploying soldiers, reported to the \"ready room\" on post to fill out final paperwork.  However, what was to be another day of the mundane erupted into hell on Earth.  Burnette heard shots, though that's a sound to which soldiers grow accustomed. He had been hearing blanks for many months of training.  But on November 5 at Fort Hood, he quickly understood that something was terribly wrong when he saw the blood -- crimson everywhere.  \"Seeing bullet wounds in the back of a friend's head, seeing friends grabbing their arms, and blood just everywhere. It's a pretty hard thing to see,\" Burnette recalled.  \"And not having any way to defend yourself.\"  The gunman had been in the room for a while and had perfectly blended in with his Army combat uniform, his gold major rank emblazoned on his chest. No one had reason to pay him heed, Burnette said.  When the madness began, the gunman popped up like a target at a shooting range. He just stood up and started firing methodically and with precision.  He reloaded. And fired. Reloaded. And fired again.  \"He was very swift, very tactical,\" said Burnette, sitting in a wheelchair at the Metroplex Adventist Hospital near Fort Hood, his left arm and hand bandaged.  The mass shooting last week was the deadliest ever on a U.S. military base. Twelve soldiers and one civilian were killed; more than 40 others were wounded.  Fifteen soldiers remained hospitalized on Wednesday, four in intensive care, according to Fort Hood spokesman Col. James Rossi.  They were victims of a soldier who turned on his own, authorities say.  Burnette saw the laser sights on the gunman's weapon. The shooter looked serious, intent. He screamed at the top of his lungs, \"Allahu akbar,\" which means 'God is great' in Arabic.  Burnette dropped to the floor, hugging the ground for dear life. His mind was spinning. What insanity was this?  \"Once I saw the blood, I realized I had to move,\" he said. \"I had to get out of there.\"  Burnette began to stand up and noticed the gunman was pointing in his direction. He picked up a folding table next to him -- it was the heaviest object he could see -- and hurled it toward the shooter. He knew it would draw the gunman's attention and divert his line of sight from others.  Burnette said he wasn't trying to play a hero.  \"There are guys overseas doing more than what I did,\" he said. \"I just happened to be at a certain place at a certain time in the world and hopefully I made a difference.\"  But that's when he got hit. He took a round that pierced his hip on the left side and tore through his abdomen.  \"After the hit, I fell down, not even realizing I had been hit,\" he said. \"As I tried to get back up, I was shot in the elbow on the left arm and... the knuckle on the left pinky finger.\"  He was like a wounded animal desperate to escape the hunter's aim.  \"He wanted to kill all of us,\" Burnette said. \"We were all unarmed.\"  Burnette's gut felt like a knife slicing through it. He couldn't feel his leg. His left arm was numb, too. He stared at it and thought of those dummy arms that people buy at Halloween.  \"Oh my God,\" he thought. \"This guy shot me.\"  Burnette began moving with every ounce of strength he could muster and hid in a nearby cubicle. The gunman had started moving to the other side of the building, reloading and shooting. Reloading and shooting.  Burnette knew he had to get out of that building.  \"As I started to run, I fell again, not realizing I couldn't use my left leg.\"  After falling, Burnette said, he \"threw all of my body weight... towards that door as hard and as fast as possible.\"  \"Once I hit that front door, I began to low crawl, about five meters up a hill just, you know, pushing my body forward with everything I had,\" he said.  A staff sergeant grabbed him by his uniform collar and dragged him into an office and locked the door.  \"Everything is going to be all right,\" the sergeant told him, as he began administering first aid. Burnette said he doesn't know the sergeant's name, but he will recognize him instantly if their paths ever cross again.  \"Our Father who art in heaven... hallowed be thy name.\"  Burnette, a practicing Catholic, lie on the ground, repeating the prayer over and over again. He didn't know whether he would see his wife again.  A week later, Burnette has undergone two operations and still has a bullet lodged in his right hip. On Wednesday, he was making his way to the Army's Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, Texas, for further treatment.  He knows that's where Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, the accused shooter, is also being treated.  \"I can't really think about it,\" Burnette said. \"I have a lot of faith in our military, our judicial system -- and God.\"  Soldiers are taught from day one that you help the wounded, even when they are enemies in combat, even the guy who shot you.  \"Don't get me wrong,\" he said, \"Everything in your heart wants to [unleash] anger at this person, but we have to trust that our system works somehow.  \"By no means am I happy that he is in better shape than a lot of my comrades,\" Burnette said about the suspect. \"But I'm not here to play God, either.\"  Ultimately, Burnette said, he is sorry for a man who feels the need to execute unarmed personnel, his comrades, in the name of God.  Does he pity the Fort Hood shooter? \"Yeah,\" he said, pausing. \"To an extent.\"  CNN's Sanjay Gupta and Danielle Dellorto contributed to this report.", "Q": ["Q: What did Burnette say he threw at the shotter?

Authorities hired translators to eavesdrop on a series of conversations in Arabic, Russian and Mandarin that led police to 86 suspects in a series of raids that started Tuesday, Brown said.

Twenty-five others remain at large, Brown added.  All of the 111 suspects were indicted in the theft case, while nearly two dozen of them were also charged in six indictments related to burglaries and robberies.

{"article": " -- Bayern Munich inflicted a record defeat on Sporting Lisbon to book their place in the quarterfinals of the Champions League by a staggering 12-1 on aggregate.  Bayern Munich players react to the crowd after their staggering 12-1 aggregate victory over Sporting.  Leading 5-0 from the first leg, a double from Lukas Podolski and Anderson Polga's own goal put them 3-0 up on the night within 40 minutes before Joao Moutinho pulled one back in stunning fashion.  It was the briefest respite for Sporting, though, Bastian Schweinsteiger hitting an immediate reply, before Mark van Bommel, Miroslav Klose (pen) and Thomas Muller netted in the second half for a 7-1 triumph on the night.  The result was a record aggregate winning margin for a post-group stage Champions League game, surpassing Lyon's 10-2 demolition of Werder Bremen in 2005.  The scoring began in the eighth minute, Podolski combining well with Ze Roberto on the edge of the box after Bayern took advantage of a poor defensive clearance before hammering home from the edge of the box.  Bayern were rampant and the second finally came after 34 minutes when a long kick from the Bayern keeper Jorg Butt sailed through to the edge of the Sporting area.  It should have been simple for the visiting defense, but a horrible mix-up between Polga and and Patricio allowed Podolski to flick the ball over his head and into the empty net.  Polga's night got even worse 39 later when he scored an own goal, volleying Schweinsteiger's cross into his own net.  There was a brief hiatus in Sporting's embarrassment when Moutinho's classy strike arrowed into the far left corner three minutes before the break to reduce the arrears.  But barely a minute later, Christian Lell pulled the ball back for Schweinsteiger to sweep home, making it 9-1 on aggregate.  Bayern coach Jurgen Klinsmann made two changes at half-time, bringing on Jose Sosa and Breno for Ze Roberto and Lucio as the pace dropped.  A fifth did arrive, though, in the 74th minute, substitute Muller's cross headed across goal by Klose for Van Bommel to control and fire home.  And Klose continued to pile on the woe for Sporting in the 82nd minute, picking himself up from a foul by Pedro Silva to convert the subsequent penalty.  Teenager Muller, making his Champions League debut, rounded things off in the final minute, poking home from Sosa's corner.", "Q": ["Q: What team bead Werder Bremen? A:", "Q: What team set a record?

{"article": "BERLIN. Germany -- Germany striker Kevin Kuranyi fired Schalke up to joint second in the Bundesliga, while Bayern Munich have a golden chance to put one hand on the league title if they beat Stuttgart on Sunday.  Kuranyi's early goal was enough to give Schalke a vital victory over Champions League rivals Hamburg.  Kuranyi's 15th league goal of the season -- after just two minutes -- gave Schalke the three points with a 1-0 win in Hamburg to go level on 54 points with Werder Bremen, who shared a thrilling 3-3 draw at Karlsruhe.  After Schalke sacked coach Mirko Slomka a fortnight ago, caretaker coach Mike Bueskens was delighted with the victory over their rivals.  \"I am very, very pleased with the win,\" he said. \"We beat a direct competitor for a Champions League place and the early goal worked very well for us. Hamburg played well, but they didn't take their chances.\"  Schalke and Bremen, who remain second on goal difference, are now nine points behind Bayern with four games left.  A Bayern win will send them 12-points clear with a vastly superior goal difference and only a mathematical miracle would prevent them being crowned German champions for the 21st time.  But Bayern are without internationals Miroslav Klose and Philipp Lahm against Stuttgart, while Oliver Kahn is a huge injury doubt for the clash against Stuttgart who welcome back Mario Gomez back from injury.  The draw in Karlsruhe was a blow to Bremen, who were shocked by an early goal when home striker Sebastian Freis drilled home his 15th minute shot.  Werder hit back when midfielder Diego equalised eight minutes later and former Schalke midfielder Mesut Oezil scored his first goal of the season to put Bremen 2-1 ahead on 29 minutes.  But Freis added his second on 59 minutes before Kapllani put Karlsruhe ahead only for Bremen striker Boubacar Sanogo to level the scores in the 86th minute.  \"It was a very entertaining game and the fans got their money's worth,\" said Bremen coach Thomas Schaaf. \"But we can't be happy with the result, because it was possible for us to keep the pressure on.\"  Further down the table, striker Mike Hanke gave Hanover an early goal at home to Hertha Berlin before Czech striker Jiri Stajner enjoyed the simplest of tap-ins to make it 2-0 after 26 minutes.  But Berlin clawed a goal back with a second-half penalty to make it 2-1 before Lukasz Piszczek equalised in the 66th minute to make it 2-2.  At the bottom of the table, Slovakian striker Marek Mintal netted a first-half goal for Nuremberg and Russian striker Ivan Saenko made it 2-0 against Arminia Bielefeld after 39 minutes with a superb strike.

{"article": "Vancouver, British Columbia (CNN)  -- Holding the Olympic medal she and her mom always wanted, Joannie Rochette finally smiled and talked about when she was a young skater and desperately wanted to make her mother proud.  Her mom, Therese, was her biggest supporter and sometimes her biggest critic, she said.  She wasn't the best \"coach,\" and she was kind of picky, but she had such a good eye, Rochette said. She was always encouraging, too, even when she was finding fault.  \"And even though she's not here anymore, I'm not afraid to say it, sometimes she was a pain in the ass,\" Rochette said laughing, probably for the first time in days.  Rochette made her mom very proud Thursday night, winning a bronze medal in the women's figure skating final, just four days after Therese Rochette died of a heart attack.  Without her mother to support her, Joannie Rochette skated into Canada's collective heart by relying on all those years of training, all those years of committing jumps and spins to muscle memory. And when she needed it most, she relied on the memory of how her mom would always convince her that she was going to be on the Olympic medals podium.  \"It feels good for me to talk about her,\" she said, joyfully recounting the many times her mom took her to practice and stay when the other moms left. She laughed when she told how her mom would assess a school test score of 98 with a \"What about those other two points?\"  \"She was my biggest fan, my best friend. She was with me every step of the way,\" she said.  When things weren't going so well in the first week Rochette was here for Olympics training, she called her mom, seeking her advice on what to do about her triple Lutz. Her mom assured her it would be all right, that she just needed to visualize doing it well in her head, that this was something she had done for years.  But doing what she did this week was something no person can ever be prepared for. To compete in the spotlight of the Olympics' marquee event, in front of an expectant and hopeful home crowd, with the heartache of her mother's death so present would take strength most of us cannot imagine. But the people closest to her knew she had that strength.  Her coach, Manon Perron, said there was never any doubt that Rochette would skate and never a doubt that she wouldn't be standing on the medals podium.  \"Never... because she was so ready and the goal was so strong,\" Perron said, just like a proud mom. \"I've been with her since she was 12 so we just have to look into each other's eyes and we know right away. It was really hard on her because her mom was the biggest thing in her life, but she's not a quitter.\"  Rochette said she struggled more than she showed during Tuesday night's short program that captivated the skating world. When she stepped on the ice, her legs were shaking, she said.  With mom in 'heart and soul,' Rochette goes for medal  \"I don't know how I ever got through this whole program. I'm sure my mom was there with me,\" she said.  Rochette was third after the short program -- 7.14 points behind Kim Yu-Na of South Korea and 2.42 points behind Mao Asada of Japan -- who skated just before her. The free skate scores are weighted more and account for roughly two-thirds of a skater's total.  Kim made it impossible for Rochette to dream of gold with an amazing free skate that was the best ever under the 6-year-old scoring system -- 150.06. The score was so high it would have beaten seven skaters' combined marks on its own. Her total of 228.56 is also a record.  Asada then put up a 131.72, virtually clinching silver.  Rochette came on the ice, looking determined, to the hockey-like cheers of the 14,000 at Pacific Coliseum. She needed a perfect skate for silver but on a triple flip, she stumbled and her chance for second place slipped away.  Later in the program she had a bit of a shaky landing after another jump, but she stayed on her feet.  After she finished she blew a kiss into the air, and came to the waiting area where she, in French, covered her heart with her right hand and spoke to her mother.  Joannie Rochette opted to stay in the games, and two days later stirred a crowd with a courageous performance.  \"Her mother is inside her heart and soul, so she'll be there for her,\" her agent Dave Baden told CNN on Wednesday, \"and [Joannie] will draw from that strength.\"  Therese Rochette herself wrote of the bond she had with her daughter in an e-mail interview with The Christian Science Monitor in January. She said that she was the first person her daughter called whenever a problem occurred, though Joannie didn't need a great amount of support, the Monitor reported this week.  \"The hurdles she faces motivate her to rise above them,\" Therese Rochette wrote to the Monitor. \"Joannie has always been naturally determined and persevering.\"  Joannie Rochette rose through the ranks of Canadian skaters, winning junior national titles before winning six straight senior national championships from 2005 to 2010. In 2006, she placed fifth at the Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy, and last year she finished second at the World Figure Skating Championships in Los Angeles, California.

{"article": " -- What's it really like to be a new member of the world's most powerful legislature? Two new U.S. representatives are teaming up with CNN.com to report their \"Freshman Year\" experience through videos and commentaries.  Jason Chaffetz and Jared Polis are taking video cameras with them as they negotiate their way in the 111th Congress, both inside and outside Washington.  They both won convincing victories in November in neighboring states, yet they are world's apart. Utah's Chaffetz is a conservative Republican married father of three who is sleeping on a cot in his congressional office to save money. Democrat Polis from Colorado is a former Internet entrepreneur who is one of the wealthiest members of Congress and the first openly gay male to be elected to the House of Representatives as a freshman.  You can follow their stories regularly on CNN.com.  Watch the action in Congress from the point of view of the Congressmen \u00bb  Here are their biographies:  \u2022 Jason Chaffetz  Rep. Jason Chaffetz is a freshman Republican congressman representing the 3rd District of Utah. He was elected in November, winning two-thirds of the vote against a Democratic challenger.  Chaffetz, 41, got the Republican nomination in an upset victory over Rep. Chris Cannon. He ousted the six-term incumbent in a low-budget campaign in which he said Cannon was not conservative enough for the district, particularly in fighting illegal immigration.  Chaffetz grew up in California, Arizona and Colorado and was recruited to Brigham Young University to be a placekicker by football coach LaVell Edwards. He set two school records as the starting placekicker and earned a degree in communications.  After college, Chaffetz joined the local business community and worked as a spokesman for Nu Skin International. Chaffetz stayed at Nu Skin for nearly 11 years, as managing director of marketing and product development and general manager for Australia and New Zealand.  Watch the reports from Week One \u00bb  Chaffetz managed Jon Huntsman Jr.'s campaign for governor of Utah and after Huntsman took office in 2005, he became his chief of staff.  He has been married to Julie Johnson for 18 years and they have three children.  \u2022 Jared Polis  Rep. Jared Polis is a freshman Democratic congressman representing the 2nd District of Colorado. He was elected in November to the seat held by Mark Udall, who ran and won for U.S. Senate. Polis defeated his Republican opponent, gaining 62 percent of the vote.  His campaign stressed environmental issues, education reform, withdrawing troops from Iraq and repealing Bush administration tax cuts for the highest-income earners. He is the first openly gay male to be elected to Congress as a freshman.  Polis, 33, was born in Boulder, Colorado, and grew up in Colorado and Southern California. He was a student at Princeton University when he co-founded a company providing Internet access and Web hosting. Growing up in his family's Boulder-based greeting card and publishing business, Blue Mountain Arts, he succeeded his grandmother as sales manager in 1996 and helped start bluemountainarts.com, an online greeting card Web site.  In 1998, he launched ProFlowers.com, a Web company to sell flowers direct from growers to consumers; its parent company was sold to Liberty Media Corporation in 2006.  Jared won statewide election in 2000 to the Colorado Board of Education and served for six years. He started a foundation and two charter schools to support improvements in education and received numerous awards for his philanthropic work.  Immediately before running for Congress, Polis served as superintendent of New America School, a charter school he founded to help 16-21-year-old new immigrants learn English and gain a high school diploma.", "Q": ["Q: Who is the Republican representative A:", "Q: Who documented their experince A:", "Q: what is the name or the Democrat representig Colorado's Second district?

{"article": " -- On February 12, 2009, Christopher Savoie received an e-mail from his ex-wife that he had feared would come.  Christopher Savoie is in jail in Japan after trying to get back his son, Isaac, and daughter, Rebecca.  About a month after their bitter divorce, in which Noriko Savoie promised as part of the agreement she wouldn't return to Japan with their children to live, she threatened to do just that.  \"It's very difficult to watch kids becoming American and losing Japanese identity,'' Noriko Savoie wrote her ex-husband in the e-mail, according to Tennessee court documents. \"I am at the edge of the cliff. I cannot hold it anymore if you keep bothering me.''  Now she is in Japan with the children. Christopher Savoie sits in a Japanese jail accused of trying to kidnap them.  He practically predicted it would end this way.  The couple, citizens of the United States and Japan, were married for 14 years and lived in Japan. But they came to the United States with 8-year-old Isaac and 6-year-old Rebecca. They divorced in January 2009 after Christopher Savoie was unfaithful. Noriko Savoie was given custody of the children and agreed to remain in the United States.  During the divorce, Christopher Savoie was concerned that his ex-wife would move to Japan with the children. After receiving the threatening e-mail, he went to court to try to prevent that.  He pleaded with a judge in March to stop Noriko Savoie from being able to travel to Japan for summer vacation.  He knew if she took the children to Japan to live the deck would be stacked against him. Japanese law would recognize Noriko Savoie as the primary custodian and he might never see his children again.  Noriko Savoie told a judge the words in her e-mail were in the heat of the moment; she was angry that her ex-husband had just married the woman who caused their marriage to end.  \"I was very, very -- at the peak of my frustration...\" Noriko Savoie told a judge, according to court transcripts. \"He actually married three days before that e-mail. He remarried the person -- a woman whom he was having affair [with], so I was very depressed and -- but also angry.\"  Noriko Savoie was asked repeatedly in court if she would try to take the children and flee to Japan. Her answer was always no.  \"I have never thought about taking children away from their father, never,\" she told the judge.  Christopher Savoie didn't believe her.  Their divorce had been rocky, both of them said. The court documents reveal bitter fights and mediations during the divorce. The two accused each other of sending harassing e-mails. They also fought over sending the kids to baseball, Scouts and other activities. Noriko Savoie accused him of not giving her enough money to take English language lessons or go to school so she could get a job. He accused her of not trying hard enough to enroll or find a place to live.  Dad paid ex-wife $800K in divorce \u00bb  Despite those issues, Christopher Savoie said his only concern was making sure he wouldn't be separated from his children.  He knew trying to get the kids back would be \"a futile effort\" if Noriko Savoie did flee with the children, according to court documents.  He laid out in court a scenario similar to what he is facing.  \"If she were to go to Japan with the children and with primary custodial rights, there's pretty much no doubt that I would have a very difficult time enforcing my rights to visitation should Noriko decide not to let the children see me,\" he said.  He said he'd have a hard time paying expensive legal fees because most of his money was tied up in his house, car and 401(k) after he gave Noriko Savoie more than $700,000 as part of the divorce settlement. With that money, he feared she'd be able to move and hide the children from him.  When appointed parental coordinators asked her if she planned to take the children to Japan, she hesitated and simply answered \"I think the kids will be happy if I'm happy.\" The judge asked Noriko Savoie rhetorically whether she would be willing to put up money, essentially a bond, to ensure she'd return from Japan. She agreed, but was never asked to do so.  Judge James G. Martin III warned Noriko Savoie she would lose her alimony, education funds and other money if she fled with the children, before ruling that he believed she wouldn't abscond with them and allowed her to travel to Japan.  Noriko Savoie followed the court's rules and took the children on vacation and returned during the required time to the United States. But days later, she took the children back to Japan.  The court in the United States granted Christopher Savoie full custody after Noriko Savoie fled the country. But that court order means nothing in Japan, where courts generally favor mothers in custody disputes.  The couple is also still considered married in Japan, because they never divorced there, Japanese police said Wednesday. And, police said, the children are Japanese and have Japanese passports.  A 1980 Hague Convention standardized laws on international child abduction, but Japan is not a party to that agreement.  Christopher Savoie knew all this when he decided this week to go to Japan to get his children back.  He took the children as Noriko Savoie walked them to school Monday in Yanagawa, a rural town in southern Japan. He headed for the nearest U.S. consulate, in the city of Fukuoka on the Southern island of Kyushu, to try to obtain passports for the children, screaming at the guards to let him in the compound. He was steps away from the front gate but still standing on Japanese soil when he was arrested.  Christopher Savoie, who will be in jail for the next 10 days while Japanese officials sort out the situation, told CNN's Kyung Lah that he was scared and just wanted to see his children.  \"I love you, Isaac, Rebecca,\" he said. \"Your daddy loves you forever. I'll be patient and strong until the day comes that I can see you both again. I am very sorry that I can't be with you.\"  Though he had warned everyone this was going to happen, this time he could speak in certainties.  He said that though he knows it might be a tough battle, it's one he will continue to vocalize.  \"I want Americans to know what's happening to me,\" Christopher Savoie said in Japanese. \"I didn't do anything wrong.\"", "Q": ["Q: The dad asked what of the judge?

{"article": "Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- The lawyer trying to get two American hikers freed from prison in Iran was not able to get a signature on bail paperwork because a judge is on vacation until Tuesday, he told CNN Sunday.  Bail has been paid for Josh Fattal and Shane Bauer, lawyer Masoud Shafiee said, but he needs the signatures of two judges to prove it.  He went to a judge's office Sunday, when he was in court on a separate case, to see if he could get the second signature, but was told that the judge is on vacation until Tuesday and that Shafiee will have to return then, the lawyer said.  Separately, a delegation of American Muslim and Christian leaders asked Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to release the hikers, his office said Sunday.  The four leaders who met with him in Tehran included Nihad Awad, the executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a photo of the meeting showed.  The head of the human rights department of the Iranian judiciary, Mohammad Javad Larijani, linked the case of Fattal and Bauer to America's treatment of detainees.  \"If the U.S. is so sensitive about two of its spies and tries to free them, it should look at the way it treats other nationalities,\" he said in an interview Sunday with the semi-official Fars news agency.  Fattal and Bauer have been held as spies for more than two years, after they apparently crossed an unmarked border between Iran and Iraq in July 2009.  The two men and a third hiker, Sarah Shourd, were seized while hiking in the Kurdish region of northern Iraq.  Iranian authorities arrested them, claiming they were spies and had entered the country illegally. Shourd, who is Bauer's fiancee, was released last year for medical reasons, although authorities said her case remains open.  Fattal and Bauer were convicted last month of spying and entering Iran illegally, and each was sentenced to eight years in prison.  Ahmadinejad recently said they could be freed, raising hopes that have been dashed and raised again several times since then.  He said in an interview with NBC's \"Today\" show that they will be released on humanitarian grounds \"in a couple of days.\"  But the judiciary shot back that only it could make decisions about their release.  Shafiee then announced that all the paperwork had been filed for them to be freed on bail, but their release was delayed.  He said he was \"very hopeful\" they would be released on Saturday, but the process is being held up by the lack of a judge's signature.  Shafiee said he would not know for sure the amount of the bail or who paid it until he sees the signed document. Earlier reports put it at $500,000 for each American.  An Omani official flew to Iran on Wednesday to help work on any negotiation, a Western diplomat told CNN at the time.  Oman helped secure the release of Shourd, posting her bail last September, a senior Obama administration official said at the time.  Ahmadinejad is slated to travel to New York for the U.N. General Assembly on Monday, the semi-official Mehr News Agency reported. He is expected to give a speech and meet with several other presidents and Iranians living in the United States.  But his visit is not linked to moves to release the Americans, said Larijani of the Iranian judiciary.

{"article": "(Mother Nature Network) -- Mother's Day poems come in all shapes and sizes.  Many address the poet's memories of his mother. Others describe the poet's gratitude for his mother. Some are very short. Some are very long.  Sometimes the mother-child relationship is complicated and the poet discusses the good times along with the bad. Other times, it's a straightforward message of love and gratitude. If nothing else, the poet almost always acknowledges the significant role a mother plays in the lives of her children.  Needless-to-say, with Mom being portrayed so many different ways in poetry, there are several avenues for approaching a selection of poems appropriate for Mother's Day.  Well, we're here to help you. Here's a list of selected works to get you started with Mother's Day poems:  Mother Nature Network: Mother's Day song guide  \"To My Mother\" by Robert Louis Stevenson  The Scottish poet evokes childhood memories in this four-line ode to Mom. It appeared \"A Child's Garden of Verses,\" a collection of 65 poems by Stevenson first published in 1885 under the title \"Penny Whistles.\"  You too, my mother, read my rhymes For love of unforgotten times, And you may chance to hear once more The little feet along the floor.  \"Kaddish\" by Allen Ginsberg  Ginsberg, one of the leading voices of the Beat Generation, wrote this lengthy poem following the 1956 death of his mother. It was published as part of a collection, \"Kaddish and Other Poems: 1958-1960.\" Its title refers to the traditional Jewish prayer recited during times of mourning.  \"To My Mother\" by Christina Rosetti  Rosetti, a 19th century English poet best known for her lengthy poem called \"Goblin's Market,\" wrote this short piece about her mother in 1842:  To-day's your natal day; Sweet flowers I bring: Mother, accept, I pray My offering. And may you happy live, And long us bless; Receiving as you give Great happiness.  Mother Nature Network: Kids' Mother's Day crafts projects  \"Thanking My Mother for Piano Lessons\" by Diane Wakoski  Wakoski, a contemporary poet who counts Allen Ginsberg among her influences, writes of the \"beauty that can come from even an ugly past\" in this poem that recounts, among other things, the financial struggles her mother accepted in order to make sure she could pay for her child's piano lessons.  \"Mother o' Mine\" by Rudyard Kipling  The Nobel laureate, who lived from 1865 to 1936, wrote about the undying love of a mother in this 11-line poem:  If I were hanged on the highest hill, Mother o' mine, O mother o' mine! I know whose love would follow me still, Mother o' mine, O mother o' mine! If I were drowned in the deepest sea, Mother o' mine, O mother o' mine! I know whose tears would come down to me, Mother o' mine, O mother o' mine! If I were damned of body and soul, I know whose prayers would make me whole, Mother o' mine, O mother o' mine!  \"Mother to Son\" by Langston Hughes  This lesser-known piece by the Harlem Renaissance writer takes the perspective of the mother speaking to her son and telling him that \"Life for me ain't been no crystal stair.\" It can be found in \"The Collected Poems of Langston Hughes.\"  \"What I Learned From My Mother\" by Julia Kasdorf  Kasdorf is the second contemporary poet on our list. She talks about how her mother taught her to comfort those in mourning, to offer healing and \"the blessing of your voice, your chaste touch.\"  Do you have a favorite Mother's Day poem?

{"article": " -- The number of deaths linked to cantaloupes contaminated with the Listeria monocytogenes bacteria has risen to 28, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Tuesday.  A total of 133 people in 26 states have been infected, according to the CDC. Additionally, a woman who was pregnant at the time of her illness had a miscarriage.  Although health officials have said it is too early to declare the outbreak over, the number of new cases is falling.  \"The peak in illnesses appears to have occurred from late August until the middle of September,\" Dr. Barbara Mahon of the CDC said last week, adding that additional monitoring will be needed for at least another two weeks.  The grower, Jensen Farms of Granada, Colorado, issued a voluntary recall of its Rocky Ford brand cantaloupes on September 14. The tainted cantaloupes should be off store shelves, the CDC has said.  Unsanitary conditions at the Colorado cantaloupe farm's packing facility are a possible contributing cause of one of the nation's worst outbreaks of listeria contamination in food, health officials have said.  The listeria outbreak is the deadliest food-borne illness outbreak in the United States since 1998.  Groups at high risk for listeria include older adults, people with weakened immune systems and pregnant women.  Cantaloupes from Jensen Farms should be disposed of immediately, even if some of them have been partially eaten, the agency recommended. If consumers are uncertain about the source of a cantaloupe, they are urged to ask their supermarket. If the source remains unknown, the fruit should be thrown out.  Refrigerating a cantaloupe will not kill the bacteria, which can grow at low temperatures, and consumers should not try to wash off the bacteria.", "Q": ["Q: How many cases have been reported in 26 states A:", "Q: The outbreak has been deadliest since when A:", "Q: The outbreak is the deadliest food-borne A:", "Q: What was recalled?

{"article": "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (CNN) -- Federal officials said Monday they are probing allegations by a former investigator into the deadliest terrorist attack in Argentine history that he was kidnapped and tortured by men who said they were national intelligence agents.  Claudio Lifschitz shows off the scars he says kidnappers carved on his back.  Claudio Lifschitz, 43, said three hooded men threw him into the back of a truck on Friday night and put a plastic bag over his head.  They then questioned him on details of the probe into the bombing of the Argentine Jewish Mutual Association (AMIA) building in Buenos Aires on July 18, 1994, he said.  Eighty-five people died and more than 200 were injured in one of the bloodiest anti-Semitic attacks in the world since World War II.  \"The police are investigating [the alleged kidnapping] as we speak,\" said Miguel Ambrosio, legal secretary in the office of federal Judge Rodolfo Canicoba Corral. \"Once the judge heard the details of the alleged incident, he ordered an investigation to the police via telephone.\"  Lifschitz said his abductors tortured him while asking about the AMIA investigation.  \"I heard the noise of a blowtorch, and that's when the worst started, and I started to feel a burn on my left arm, and I could smell my hair on my arm burning,\" Lifschitz told CNN. \"Then I felt them slicing my back with a knife.\"  Images of Lifschitz taken after the alleged kidnapping showed bloody marks on his back where the letters 'AMIA' had been scratched.  The assailants also carved numbers into his arm; the significance of the digits is unclear. Lifschitz said he was released a few hours after being abducted. He was treated for injuries in a hospital.  \"They told me that I wouldn't die unless they wanted me to,\" he said Sunday.  Lifschitz, who has also worked as a lawyer for Argentine Federal Police, is the former legal secretary for Judge Juan Jose Galeano, who headed the investigation into local connections to the AMIA bombing until he was removed from the case.  Lifschitz has testified that Galeano mishandled the investigation, including allegedly making a $400,000 bribe to a key witness. Galeano was taken off the AMIA investigation in 2003 and was removed from his position as a judge in 2005.  The investigation in the AMIA bombing has dragged on for nearly 15 years, with no indictments and a series of accusations of cover-ups and corruption.  Argentina, Israel and the United States have blamed the Mideast-based Hezbollah terrorist organization for the attack.  In March 2007, Interpol issued arrest warrants for five Iranian officials and a Lebanese national in connection with the bombing. Tehran has repeatedly denied any involvement.  Former Argentine President Carlos Menem also has been investigated to see whether he was involved in a cover-up.  Menem appeared in federal court Monday on an issue related to the AMIA attack investigation but declined to testify. He did submit a written statement denying that he had any involvement in a cover-up.  Lifschitz said his alleged abductors were interested in the possible Iranian connection.  \"They started to ask about information about the SIDE (State Intelligence Secretariat) related to the AMIA attack,\" Lifschitz told CNN.  \"And then they asked me about cassettes of conversations between the Iranians. That shows that the SIDE doesn't deny that they had intercepted some phone lines with the help of some judges.  \"They were afraid that I had copies of these tapes and I would present them to a judge, but I told them that I don't have any copies of the tapes.\"  Lifschitz, who said he is a non-practicing Jew, also told CNN the men were interested in his religion.  \"I always wear a rosary around my neck, and they grabbed me by the neck and said, 'Why are you wearing this if you're a Jew?'\"  In addition to the AMIA attack, a similar deadly anti-Semitic terrorist attack took place on March 17, 1992, when 29 people died and more than 250 were injured in a bombing at the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires. No one has been prosecuted in that case.  Argentina has one of the world's largest Jewish populations, estimated around 250,000.  Jewish leaders from around the world called for an investigation into the attack on Lifschitz.  \"We trust Argentine authorities will quickly find those who carried out this brutal attack on Mr. Lifschitz,\" said David Harris, executive director of the American Jewish Committee. \"This awful incident undermines Argentina's important progress to bring to justice those responsible for the murderous attack on AMIA's headquarters.\"  Earlier this month, an Argentine court ordered the seizure of property owned by a former Iranian diplomat in Buenos Aires sought for his role in the 1994 AMIA attack.", "Q": ["Q: What the police investigating?

{"article": " -- Allies of Philippines President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo on Wednesday defeated an attempt by opposition leaders to impeach her on large-scale corruption charges -- the fourth such attempt in four years.  Protesters display slogans in front of the House of Representatives in Manila on Tuesday.  The House Justice Committee dismissed the impeachment complaint by 42-8 votes, saying that it was \"insufficient in substance,\" the state-run Philippines News Agency reported.  The complaint alleged that Arroyo and her husband were directly involved in an Internet broadband deal with a Chinese firm. The deal was ultimately scrapped amid allegations of corruption.  \"I'm not saying that there is no substance (to the complaint), but it was insufficient,\" Deputy House Speaker Pablo Garcia told the committee before the vote.  \"The allegations are not allegations of fact. They are conclusions, opinion, inferences, and even arguments,\" Garcia said, according to the news agency.  Arroyo first took office in 2001. Since then, she has survived four impeachment attempts and periodic rumors of coup.  She won re-election in 2004, but opposition parties called into question the legitimacy of that race.  During the vote count, Arroyo was tape-recorded talking to a senior election official, which opposition leaders charge is evidence she manipulated the outcome. The president has denied any wrongdoing.  The first of the impeachment charges were brought against Arroyo in 2005 for vote-tampering. Congress rejected the charges.  The opposition then tried to impeach Arroyo in 2006 and 2007 -- and Congress dismissed those attempts as well.

{"article": "  -- A study published Monday in the journal Pediatrics indicates about 1 percent of children ages 3 to 17 have autism or a related disorder, an increase over previous estimates.  Children at the Marcus Autism Center in Atlanta, Georgia, receive instruction on March 5, 2009.  \"This is a significant issue that needs immediate attention,\" Dr. Ileana Arias, deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday. \"A concerted effort and substantial national response is warranted.\"  The study used data from the federal government's 2007 national survey of children's health. The survey of parents was conducted by the Health Resources and Services Administration, and by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  The results are based on a national telephone survey of more than 78,000 parents of children ages 3 to 17.iReport.com: How has autism affected your family?  In the study, parents were asked whether a health care provider had ever told them their child had an autism spectrum disorder. ASD is a group of brain disorders comprising autism and two less severe disorders: Asperger's disorder and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified.  Children with the disorder show impairment in social interaction and in their ability to communicate. They often display repetitive behavior.  Watch families discuss autism \u00bb  The investigators also asked a follow-up question: Were the children considered to have ASD now? Nearly 40 percent of the parents and guardians said no.  That finding led the authors to question whether some of the children originally diagnosed as having ASD may have been improperly diagnosed, since the disorders are not considered curable.  But Kogan said the two surveys cannot be compared because the earlier investigators did not ask the follow-up question about whether the children were still considered to have the disorder.  Still, based on the findings, lead author Dr. Michael D. Kogan of HRSA's maternal and child health bureau estimated the prevalence of ASD among U.S. children ages 3 to 17 at 110 per 10,000 -- slightly more than 1 percent.  Boys were four times as likely as girls to have ASD, and non-Hispanic black and multiracial children were less likely than non-Hispanic white children.  He estimated that 673,000 children have ASD in the United States.  Monday's findings of nearly 1 in 100 appear to indicate an increase from the average of 1 in 150 that was reported in 2003, the researchers said.  The researchers urged caution in interpreting the change, noting that an increase in diagnoses does not necessarily mean that more children have the disorder. It could simply reflect a heightened awareness of the disorder.  \"We don't know whether the change in the number over time is a result of the change in the actual condition, in the actual number of conditions or in part due to the fact that the condition is being recognized differently,\" Arias said.  She said that preliminary results from a separate, CDC-funded study she is working on also indicate that about 1 percent of children in the United States are affected by ASD. That study is to be published later this year, she said.  \"This is a behavioral diagnosis, and it's difficult to make, and it's difficult to make at young ages,\" said Dr. Peter van Dyck, HRSA's associate administrator for maternal and child health.  Half of the cases were considered mild by their parents, the study reported.  The results underscore the importance of creating policies that will result in early identification and intervention, the officials said.  The reports raise \"a lot of questions about how we are preparing in terms of housing, employment, social support -- all the issues that many of these people are going to need,\" said Dr. Tom Insel, director of the National Institute of Mental Health.  \"It also raises questions about how well we're prepared in the educational system to provide for the special needs of many of these kids.\"  Insel said the federal government is beefing up the resources it is mobilizing to address autism and related disorders, with $85 million being appropriated by the National Institutes of Health and $48 million for next year by the HRSA.", "Q": ["Q: what are the results based on A:", "Q: What will the awareness help to do?

{"article": " -- Last Wednesday, a Twitter fight erupted between technology experts Michael Arrington, founder and former editor of TechCrunch, and Vivek Wadhwa, a technology researcher and writer, after a screening of CNN's documentary, \"The New Promised Land: Silicon Valley.\"  Arrington said a few very clear things about his view of the state of diversity in Silicon Valley. Among them: There may be very few African-Americans in Silicon Valley, but despite this Silicon Valley is a pure meritocracy, and one becomes successful because he or she has a \"big brain.\" Vivek disagreed. As an Indian-American entrepreneur, he said he sees significant bias in Silicon Valley, and even recounted a specific instance where he was told, \"You people don't make good CEOs.\"  First, let me say, I think Arrington truly believes everything he has said about the tech world being a meritocracy. Lots of people believe it.  But not me. I would more properly say that tech markets are a meritocracy. There are very few businesses where an individual in his or her bedroom can create a piece of software that can potentially touch millions of people, and do this without seeking any additional capital. No matter how talented you are, if you want to open a hot new restaurant or a shoe factory, you need lots of money before you start. Not necessarily so with software.  Consumers and businesses, for the most part, don't care about the ethnicity of their software or Internet service vendor. Users want solutions. So if an entrepreneur can get a great product completed cheaply, he or she can often compete on a totally even footing with anyone else. Even if the entrepreneur ultimately needs capital, explosive initial success knocks down all known barriers.  But the market makers operate in a world that is not particularly evenhanded. The market makers are the folks who help new young companies and entrepreneurs by providing insight, mentoring, capital and relationships. This part of the tech world is driven by all the same biases that exist in the nontech world. And it is much harder for even the most talented African-Americans in the tech world to gain access to influential, insightful, connected mentors, let alone investors.  Why is this? For the most part, people want to work with people who are \"like them\" or who fit a pattern that appeals to them. There is an actual term for this among tech investors called \"pattern matching.\" It's the idea that, without objective facts, one can decide whether someone is likely to be successful based on indirect criteria. In other words, when they see a particular pattern of \"personhood,\" they are excited.  Watch trailer for CNN documentary \"The New Promised Land: Silicon Valley\"  These patterns are discussed openly in the tech industry around issues like age. Since it is only moderately politically incorrect to suggest that younger entrepreneurs are \"better,\" it is done all the time. The best example of this might be Mike Moritz from Sequoia Capital, perhaps the most influential of all venture funds, admitting in a Building 43 interview that they have a strong bias toward very young entrepreneurs.  But if you believe that age is the only criteria that venture capitalists use for pattern matching, I wanna smoke some of what you've got.  To be clear, I am not saying any venture capitalist says at a partner meeting, \"You know I really like this company's product, but did you notice he's a Negro?\"  Never happens.  But I firmly believe, based on my 25 years in this industry, that market makers, both investors and the people who help you get ready to approach them, seek out entrepreneurs who appeal to them on some less than objective, visceral level, who feel \"comfortable\" to them. They don't need to actively filter out undesirable profiles. They just focus on what does appeal to them.  Soledad O'Brien: Michael Arrington is right (about one thing)  They focus on the \"patterns\" they find appealing -- age is arguably a part of many investors' ideal pattern, but so are perhaps unacknowledged criteria like race, gender, cultural affinity, etc. On some level this should not be shocking, as it reflects socialization that all of us must work hard and consciously not to act on.  Is this racist/sexist/ageist? Well, in this context, using incendiary labels is only likely to make people more defensive. The bigger question is, is it a problem? Absolutely.  It's not just a personal impression. In a recent study, industry analyst CB Insights found that less than 1% of all venture capital money went to digital start-ups with African-American founders in 2010.  Is it possible to overcome these barriers? I have. I have developed successful, best-selling, award-winning products and I have raised tens of millions of dollars. But it is only by a sheer persistence and focus that few other people -- white, black, or otherwise -- have. I would never suggest that I am smarter than anyone else, but my Arnold-Schwarzenegger-in-\"Terminator\"-like determination has made my successes possible. Yes, I have definitely had help and support, but compared to some, not so much.  In fact, some people get far more support than others. For example, when a top tier venture capitalist writes a $5 million check to a 19-year-old with a barely beyond napkin stage idea, no customers and a fragile technology because they \"present well,\" then clearly something else is at work beyond merit. This exact scenario may not be common, but it does happen. But it does not happen for African-American, or for that matter, Latino or female entrepreneurs.  So the bottom line is, if the level of determination that I have was required from everyone, no matter their race, on some kind of moderately equal basis, it would indeed be a level playing field -- a meritocracy. But it's not.  The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Hank Williams.", "Q": ["Q: What percentage of venture capital went to blacks in 2010?

{"article": "LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Actor Derek Mears has a big hockey mask to fill.  Derek Mears arrives on the red carpet at the Hollywood premiere of the new \"Friday the 13th\" movie.  Mears was cast as the iconic boogeyman Jason Voorhees in the new \"Friday the 13th\" movie.  A remake of the original 1980 film, the new movie aims to breathe life into the former franchise about a psychopathic killer who preys on a group of young people at the fictitious Camp Crystal Lake.  Mears is no stranger to the horror genre, having co-starred in \"The Hills Have Eyes II.\" His career is extensive and includes stints as a stuntman in two of the popular \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" films.  He recently spoke to CNN about taking a turn as the ultimate evil, the thrill of continuing a slasher legacy and why he's really not that bloody nice.  CNN: You aren't that scary in person, so what made you think you could be that scary on camera?  Derek Mears: I've got a lot of issues. I've got a whole lot of daddy issues.  No, I sound like a basket case. It's funny with acting -- we all wear masks in our normal life. Not to sound like a weirdo in the hockey mask, but like right now I'm really excited about the film and excited about playing the character, and I will start to speak faster.  That's kind of what's coming over me: \"Oh you're, you're really nice,\" but... on the other side of me there are other Dereks that are angry, and like I said before, have a little bit of issues.  CNN: Tell me a little bit about how you were approached. Did you know they were making it before they came to you? Was it kind of a shock?  Mears: It's so weird. There's two different versions. There's my version of how it went about, and there's the producer's version.  I'll tell the producer's version because my version is really, really long. The short version of my version was I heard they were doing a new \"Friday the 13th,\" and I've never tried to pursue a role before and I went, I really want to do this.  So when I heard they were doing it, before I even had an audition, I started training for it. I found out a little about what they wanted for the character -- that he wasn't going to be super, you know bulky or big, that he's more functional. He's still big, but he's lean. So I started training that way and trying to do what I could just to get an audition.  On the other end, on the producer's end, they asked a bunch of different industry professionals. They said, \"Hey, were doing a new 'Friday the 13th.' Who do you think would be a great new Jason?\" And my name kept popping up, which I'm blown away by.  They brought me in for an audition, and I met with them. and they called me the next day and went, \"OK, you're the guy.\" And I still don't believe it till this day. I'm blown away.  CNN: How did you keep it light on the set?  Mears: Believe it or not, all the actors... got along so well. I have never been so close to a cast before on set. We were just goofing around and playing, but then when it's time to work and get serious with certain scenes, we'd all switch over and do our job and get to the point where we needed to.  CNN: Had you seen any of the original \"Friday the 13th\" movies?  Mears: Oh yeah. I mean, I'm a fan. I consider myself a fan of the series.  I already knew all of the originals. I had them all on DVD, and when I first met with Platinum Dunes [the production company behind the new movie], I told them, \"Hey look, I'm a fan of the series first and foremost. If I'm right for the part, fantastic. If I'm not right for the part, that's OK, too. I, just as a fan, want to see a good 'Friday the 13th' film. I want to see the series continue so if I can help it, awesome, but I just want to see something good.\"  CNN: Did you try to model your character after previous Jasons, or did you try to kind of take it and make it your own?  Mears: Definitely make it my own.  I used the script that Mark Swift and Damian Shannon wrote as a blueprint -- like you would for any acting role where I knew the other guys who've played \"Jason\" before, and what they've done, but you kind of shove that away somewhere deep in your brain and build your character from the new script.  And there are times in the film here and there where I would do little tips of the hats or little homage for the guys who have played him before.  CNN: It's kind of a dream come true.  Mears: Yeah, that's why I keep saying the words this whole interview like \"unbelievable,\" unbelievable because I don't believe it.  CNN: Which is funny. You don't usually think of such happiness and glee [on a horror movie set].  Mears: And trust me, you won't see that in the final product.

{"article": " -- Carl Edwards, one of NASCAR's elite, makes a living traveling at speeds upwards of 200 mph and is on the road more than 200 days a year. So when he wants to slow down, he heads to his hometown of Columbia, Missouri.  NASCAR driver Carl Edwards grew up in Columbia, Missouri.  He grew up in Columbia and couldn't wait to get out of town, but after living in North Carolina for three years, he was ready to come back.  \"I realized after being away, there just aren't many places cooler than this,\" Edwards said. \"So I moved back, and now I live here and I'm really proud to live here.\"  He competes in both the Nationwide Series and the Sprint Cup Series for NASCAR. He won a Busch Series Cup in 2007, finished last year's Sprint Cup Series in second, and is fiercely fighting for Sprint Cup honors this year.  Edwards has recovered from a frightening crash-ending to his last race in Talladega, Alabama, and is looking forward to racing in Richmond, Virginia, this week, hoping for his first trip of the season to victory lane. His fans are eagerly awaiting that trademark victory back flip. But through all of the excitement and acclaim, Edwards remains grounded and true to his Missouri roots.  He took CNN home with him to Columbia -- which is between Kansas City and St. Louis -- to share some of his favorite spots.  The day started at Rock Bridge State Park, 2,273 acres of natural beauty and serenity that is hard to believe is only 10 minutes from the bustling center of this college town.  \"This park is one of Columbia's best secrets. It's a beautiful place to come mountain biking, hiking. There's a cave that runs under this ground that goes for over 50 miles.\"  The park boasts 15 miles of trails and endless possibilities for adventure, from hiking and biking to canoeing and even cave exploration.  When Edwards gets the need for speed at home, he opts for two wheels instead of four. He grabs his bicycle and heads to the Katy Trail, just up the road from Rock Bridge Park.  \"This used to be an old railroad, and now it's a state park. It's 10 feet wide, it's over 200 miles long, and all of this is open to the public.\"  Edwards also showed us one of his favorite trail features: a beautiful giant bur oak tree simply referred to by Missouri natives as \"the big bur oak.\" Edwards says it's one of the oldest in the state and thinks that it is one of the coolest spots along the trail.  All that exercise and fresh air can certainly rev up an appetite, and Edwards has two favorite places to cure that. For what he calls the best burger in the world, he heads to Booches Billiard Hall, one of his high school hangouts.  \"We used to come here in high school when we probably should have been in school. We'd shoot pool, eat booch burgers and just have a good time,\" he said.  We were greeted by one of the owners, Charlie Kurry, who poked a little fun at Edwards' trademark backflip celebration.  \"The only thing flipping in here is the burgers,\" Kurry said. Booches has been in operation in Columbia since 1884.  Next up is Shakespeare's Pizza, which has been serving slices in Columbia for more than 35 years.  \"They can make you anything you want. They've got whole wheat crust if you're into the health stuff like I am. And it's so good, they even catered my wedding.\"  These are just some of the hidden gems of Carl Edwards' Columbia, but this town has much more to offer.  There are museums, festivals and parades, and the University of Missouri has provided a lot of athletic excitement with its football and basketball teams over the past few years. It's a perfect weekend getaway from its larger surrounding cities. And if you live farther away than that, it's worth the trip!", "Q": ["Q: Who shares his favourite spots?

{"article": "In our Behind the Scenes series, CNN correspondents share their experiences in covering news and analyze the stories behind the events. CNN's Christiane Amanpour meets the Dalai Lama and some of his unruly flock in \"Buddha's Warriors\" airing Saturday and Sunday, 8 and 11 p.m. ET  The Dalai Lama cracked jokes and chatted when a storm knocked out power during his interview with CNN.  DHARAMSALA, India (CNN) -- I never knew much about Buddhism, and was not expecting much, spiritually, from covering the Dalai Lama. But what happened just goes to show how the unlikeliest events can affect you at the unlikeliest times.  I flew from covering the historic visit of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra in North Korea to Dharamsala, India. This is the home-in-exile of the Dalai Lama and his government, as well as thousands of Tibetan monks and supporters.  Our visit coincided with the events that commemorate each March 10, the date the Dalai Lama fled Tibet on horseback in 1959. He managed to evade the Chinese Communist forces, disguised as a soldier and escaping at night. The somber remembrance is a little like what the Palestinians do every year. They call it al-Nakba, or \"catastrophe,\" which marks 1948 when they lost much of their land as the state of Israel was founded.  This year, however, the March 10 anniversary took on a more ominous tone. It was the first time the growing split among Tibetan exiles burst into the open. Some of the younger generation of exiles are losing faith in the Dalai Lama's abandonment of the dream of Tibetan independence. Some want action, even if it might mean abandoning their peaceful Buddhist way.  I wanted to ask the Dalai Lama about this and where he thought it would lead.  The day we visited, we attended a \"Long Life Ceremony\" in which thousands of Tibetans come from all over India and across the Himalayas from Tibet to catch a glimpse of their spiritual leader, to pray for his continued health and long life and to bestow their most precious gifts upon him, including cubes of dried cheese wrapped in muslin, textiles and tapestries.  It went on for more than two hours. I never thought I would sit through the whole thing, but something about the chanting, the incense and the vital connection between the Dalai Lama and his adoring flock was mesmerizing.  Watch: Amanpour investigates new breed of Buddhists \u00bb  As a journalist and an observer, I was transfixed.  Even though the Dalai Lama has spent nearly 60 years in exile, people are still so faithful to him, so respectful, weeping, bowing low as they pass him sitting high above on his throne-like dais. He towers over them, and yet there is nothing removed or dictatorial about him.  See behind-the-scenes photos from Buddha's Warriors \u00bb  Afterwards we prepared for our interview. He gives many, and I wondered what we could elicit from him that would be new or noteworthy. As our cameramen were setting up, I hung around outside to quietly watch as he received the first of many visitors that day: dignitaries, ordinary tourists, prayer groups and school groups.  I've found you can tell almost everything about a person by observing the way they deal with others. He was kind, witty, warm, laugh-out-loud funny and deeply moved by some of the personal tales he heard from those visitors seeking his advice and blessing. I thought about how he must do this so many hundreds of thousands of times and yet he had time for everyone, treating each one like a VIP.  Once we sat down, I was immediately slightly thrown off by his style. He told us very clearly that what the Chinese are doing in Tibet amounts to \"cultural genocide.\" And then he burst into his trademark giggles. I couldn't fully understand why, but it is apparently the Buddhist way to laugh off life's horrors, and thus survive.  Learn about Tibet's history of conflict \u00bb  He went on to tell us, with great earnestness, how he approves of the Olympic Games being held in Beijing and how he is not trying to seek full independence from China, just what he calls cultural autonomy.  This man, who is lionized for his quiet spirituality and for being a one-man movement of conscience, who had won a Nobel Peace Prize, calls himself a simple Buddhist monk. As we sat there, suddenly a thunderstorm broke and all our lights went out and we were plunged into darkness. Any other important interviewee would have swept out to rest while we dealt with it. Not the Dalai Lama. He sat there with us in the dark, cracking jokes and chatting, as we waited for the generator to kick in.  The Chinese government says the Dalai Lama is lying when he says he does not want independence from China. They call him a wolf in sheep's clothing. So why, I wondered, would he not overtly support the young generation of Tibetans who want a more proactive policy of confronting China?  Over and again I asked him about the split among his ranks. He said he would not condemn them as he believed in democracy and free speech. But nor would he support their tactics or their goals. He just kept asking (rhetorically) a simple question: With what are we going to fight them? Are we 6 million Tibetans going to confront the army of 1.2 billion people? How?  The Chinese government refused repeatedly to talk to us and accused us of trying to \"beatify\" the Dalai Lama. I couldn't help wondering why they won't talk to him or meet him halfway.  They may be trying to wait out the 74-year-old Dalai Lama. But they must know they'll have much more trouble on their hands once he is gone and the angry younger generation takes over.", "Q": ["Q: what was the reason for the visit A:", "Q: where was he exiled A:", "Q: Who traveled to India?

{"article": " -- Somali President Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed said Saturday he will give in to a rebel demand that he impose Islamic law, or sharia, in an effort to halt fighting between Somali forces and Islamic insurgents.  President Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed  says sharia law in Somalia will not be strict.  However, Ahmed told a news conference he won't agree to a strict interpretation of the law, which forbids girls from attending school, requires veils for women and beards for men, and bans music and television.  The president, speaking at his palace in the capital, Mogadishu, said local elders and religious leaders, acting as liaisons with the militants, brought him a message saying the rebels wanted a truce in the two-year-old fighting. He also asked African peacekeepers to stand down.  Ahmed, who was elected January 31, said he would ask the AU contingent to leave once there is a solid political solution to the conflict.  More than 40,000 Somalis have returned to abandoned neighborhoods in Mogadishu over the past six weeks, despite some of the heaviest fighting in months, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said Friday.  They are part of the more than a million residents who have been displaced by fighting in Somalia, including 100,000 who fled to neighboring countries last year alone, according to the United Nations.  Ethiopian troops entered the country at its request in December 2006. The Ethiopians ousted the Islamic Courts Union, an Islamic movement that had claimed control of Mogadishu earlier that year.  Ethiopia's action had the blessing of the United States, which accused the Islamic Courts Union of harboring fugitives from al Qaeda. But various Islamist groups -- including al-Shabab, which the United States has designated a terror organization -- rejected the presence of Ethiopian forces and mounted an insurgent campaign against the Ethiopians and the transitional government.

Visitors used to spend only an hour or so at his house, then leave still thinking of George Washington as that grim, old man on the dollar bill. Now, visitors meet him face-to-face in three life-sized statues, and they can't get enough of America's first action hero.  At the museum at Mount Vernon, the 45-year-old future president is depicted riding in Valley Forge.  \"He's tall! He's strong! He's handsome!\" they may exclaim when seeing him for the first time. Today's first President is a well-rounded figure at the expanded visitors center, museum, and education facility at Mount Vernon Estate & Gardens in Virginia.  A new face for George  Washington now startles visitors. As they walk through the Donald W.

Southeast Flooding - Witness the impact of severe flooding across the southeastern U.S.  Troops in Afghanistan - Consider different opinions on how to fight the war in Afghanistan.  Transcript  THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.  CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: The U.N. General Assembly is in session, and so is this edition of CNN Student News. Bringing you today's commercial-free headlines, I'm Carl Azuz.  First Up: Leaders Talk Climate Change  AZUZ: First up, representatives from nearly 200 countries come together in New York to talk about global issues. This is called the United Nations General Assembly, and the decisions and resolutions that it makes set the agenda for a lot of what the U.N. works on throughout the year. One of the biggest focuses for this gathering is climate change. Secretary General Ban ki Moon calls it one of the most important issues of the 21st century. He's hoping that countries will work on ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which many scientists believe contribute to climate change.  During speeches yesterday, President Obama and Chinese President Hu Jintao, who lead the countries that give off the most greenhouse gases, pledged to try to reduce them. Neither leader offered a specific timeframe for this, but both said they plan to cut greenhouse gases and increase the use of clean energy sources.  President Obama also touched on another controversial issue yesterday: the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Peace talks between the two groups have fizzled out recently, but Obama is urging both sides to come back to the negotiating table and work on a permanent solution. He met with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu yesterday in an effort to restart discussions between these two.  U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Despite all the mistrust, we have to find a way forward. We have to summon the will to break the deadlock that has trapped generations of Israelis and Palestinians in an endless cycle of conflict and suffering.  Spoken Word  SONNY PERDUE, GOVERNOR OF GEORGIA: This has been a 48-hour ordeal that people had been, stayed here and to care for the safety of people. I just want to thank them. I want to thank those firefighters and first responders all across Georgia, from the east and Stevens county, to the west in Paulding and Carroll and Douglas, and in Cherokee in northwest Georgia. This has been a huge effort.  Southeast Flooding  AZUZ: Okay, that was Georgia's Gov. Sonny Perdue there, talking about severe flooding that has led to at least eight deaths. Noting that nearly all of those were from drivers and passengers who were swept away by floodwaters, Gov. Perdue pleaded with residents to stay off the roads until the waters recede. Yesterday, he planned to ask President Obama to declare a federal emergency in order to free up money that would help with the relief efforts. With flash flood watches stretching across parts of the southeastern U.S., Rob Marciano examines the impact of this severe weather.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  ROB MARCIANO, CNN METEOROLOGIST: It's a cruel irony. After months of drought, heavy rains spawning deadly floods. Across much of the southeast, streets are covered. Homes are destroyed. Tranquil creeks now on a rampage. In some places near Atlanta, nearly two feet of rain fell.  UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is the highest water that I've seen, and I've been living around here all my life.  MARCIANO: This couple was rescued by boat in the pitch black. They had to use flashlights to see. And the only thing they could bring with them: their dog and a few family treasures.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: These are my wedding pictures.  MARCIANO: But they were luckier than others, others who lost something so much more dear. In Georgia, right now, 17 counties under a state of emergency. Officials say they're in rescue and recovery mode, but those rescues, especially around Atlanta, have been slow and difficult.  Pictures showing just how crippled some areas of the city are. In the western suburb of Powder Springs, a house is left to burn. Next to it, a fire truck stranded, helpless in the rising floodwaters. These two men had to get around on inflatable mattresses, and so many people are stunned by what they're seeing.  UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Right now, shock. I don't think it's really set in that this is real. This is, we're flooded out. We don't have a home.  MARCIANO: Rob Marciano, CNN, Austell, Georgia.  (END VIDEO CLIP)  AZUZ: For another perspective, look at this! This is the amusement park, Six Flags over Georgia and under water. It's located west of Atlanta, and what you're seeing here is a coaster called the Scream Machine. I think I've ridden this thing every time I've been to Six Flags. From the looks of it, I won't be doing that again anytime soon. Amazing pictures.  Impact Your World  AZUZ: Obviously, the relief efforts are going to be going on for a while. Several organizations are already at work. To find out how you can take part, head to the Spotlight section on our home page and click on the \"Impact Your World\" link.  I.D. Me  MICHELLE WRIGHT, CNN STUDENT NEWS: See if you can I.D. Me! I'm a Central American nation located between Guatemala and Nicaragua. I gained my independence from Spain in 1821. My capital city is Tegucigalpa. I'm Honduras, and I'm home to about 7.8 million people.  Ousted President  AZUZ: Political turmoil has led to clashes in that capital city, all based around Honduran President Jose Manuel Zelaya. He was actually removed from office back in June and faces charges of violating the country's constitution. Zelaya, who's in the white hat in the middle of your screen here, returned to Honduras Monday. He took up refuge in the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa. If he leaves, the Honduran government says it will arrest him. The Brazilian embassy isn't considered part of Honduras, so Zelaya can't be arrested as long as he stays inside. Police and soldiers positioned outside the embassy clashed with Zelaya's supporters before clearing the area yesterday. The situation has led the U.S. to close its embassy in the Honduran capital.  Troops in Afghanistan  AZUZ: Meantime, the president of Afghanistan says he supports a top U.S. commander's call to increase the number of U.S. troops in the Asian country. President Hamid Karzai called it \"the right approach.\" But it's certainly not the only one. As Barbara Starr explains, there are several ideas on how to fight the war in Afghanistan, and who that war should be against.  (BEGIN VIDEO)  BARBARA STARR, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT: As violence increases daily in Afghanistan, some are calling for a major troop build-up. The president signaling when he ordered a review of the Afghan war, he wasn't anxious to quickly send tens of thousands of additional troops to Afghanistan to fight the Taliban insurgency.  OBAMA: Let's do a soup-to-nuts re-evaluation, focusing on what our original goal was, which was to get al Qaeda, the people who killed 3,000 Americans.  STARR: Attacking al Qaeda is fundamentally a counter-terrorism strategy, requiring a limited number of new troops. It's the \"Plan B\" advocated by some in the White House, according to a senior Pentagon official. But Gen. Stanley McChrystal, the top commander, is still calling for a counterinsurgency strategy to strengthen Afghanistan to the point the Taliban have no safe haven there. That could take tens of thousands of more troops beyond the 68,000 now planned. Retired Gen. Montgomery Meigs says it's a must.  GEN. MONTGOMERY MEIGS (RET.), U.S. ARMY: If you're going to get the tribes over on your side and the side of government, you have to have enough people there to make things happen for them, economically, socially and in terms of security.  STARR: Could the Pentagon put U.S. firepower, such as fighter jets and drones, in neighboring countries to reduce the U.S. presence inside Afghanistan?  MEIGS: My point is, if you don't have the kind of intelligence you need to make those systems effective, you are going to swing and miss a lot.  STARR: The powerful chairman of the Senate Armed Service committee says more U.S. troops right away are not the answer for another reason.  SEN. CARL LEVIN (D-MI), CHAIRMAN, ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE: I've been recommending to the president that, first of all, before any consideration is made of additional combat forces, that we get the Afghan army bigger, better equipped.  STARR: The new bottom line? Support for the war in Afghanistan is declining, and the president and his commanders will have to make the case for whatever comes next. Barbara Starr, CNN, the Pentagon.  (END VIDEO)  Promo  AZUZ: Afghanistan, Honduras, the southeastern U.S.: Today's show is all over the map.

At the end of a recent high school game in Missouri, Matt Ziesel took a handoff and hightailed it all the way to the end zone, scoring his team's only touchdown of the day. So, why is this noteworthy? Well, Matt has Down Syndrome, a genetic disorder. He's always dreamed of scoring a TD. So, with the clock winding down and his team down 46-0, Matt's coach wanted to give him that chance. He talked to the other team's coach, who agreed to give up the shutout and let Matt score.  Goodbye  AZUZ: Great story. We'd love to hear your thoughts on it. Would you give up a shutout to help someone out? Would you have done it for Matt Ziesel?

Robert Park told relatives before Christmas that he was trying to sneak into the isolated communist state to bring a message of \"Christ's love and forgiveness\" to North Korean leader Kim Jong Il. In a written statement issued Tuesday on the family's behalf, his brother, Paul Park, said Park's well-being \"has been a source of ongoing concern and anxiety\" since they received reports he had entered North Korea.  \"He is a very special member of our family. We miss having his love and compassion in our home,\" the family statement said. \"I don't know where he's being held, but if he can receive this message, we want him to know we love him, we miss him and we are waiting anxiously for the opportunity to be reunited with him.\"  Paul Park said his San Diego, California-area family is working with the U.S. State Department and members of Congress to bring about his \"eventual safe return.\"  North Korea announced Tuesday that it was holding an American who entered the country illegally from China on Christmas Eve. The state-run Korea Central News Agency did not identify the man, who it said was \"now under investigation by a relevant organ.\"  Monday, State Department spokesman Ian Kelly said Washington was concerned by reports that Park had gone into North Korea but could not confirm them. Washington and Pyongyang have no diplomatic relations, but Kelly said the Swedish Embassy -- which looks after U.S. interests in North Korea -- has offered to try to find out more.  A South Korean Web site last week posted a copy of the letter it said Park was trying to deliver to Kim, which urged the North Korean leader in the name of Jesus Christ to free political prisoners and \"open your borders so that we may bring food, provisions, medicine, necessities, and assistance to those who are struggling to survive.\"  North Korean authorities take a dim view of people who enter the country without authorization. Two American journalists who were arrested along the North Korean-Chinese border in March faced a 12-year sentence at hard labor, but were released after a meeting between Kim and former U.S. President Bill Clinton in Pyongyang.  But Park's parents told CNN affiliate KFMB that their son was willing to risk his life to deliver his message to Kim.", "Q": ["Q: The American was taken into custody after entering from where?

{"article": "FARGO, North Dakota (CNN)  -- Forecasters issued flash flood warnings for Bismarck and surrounding areas Wednesday, as volunteers rushed to fill sandbags ahead of expected record floods in the flat state of North Dakota.  Explosives are set off in the Missouri River on Wednesday to break up ice jams.  Areas of three counties -- Morton, Emmons and Burleigh, which includes the North Dakota capital of Bismarck -- were under a flash flood warning until 12:30 p.m. CT (1:30 p.m. ET), the National Weather Service said.  In an effort to alleviate the flooding, demolition crews blew up an ice jam Wednesday evening south of  Bismarck, according to CNN affiliate KXMB.  Mayor John Warford said that water appeared to be moving more freely in the Missouri River after the explosives were set off, KXMB reported. The plan is make sure water continues flow through the river channel and not spread out over land. Ice jams in rivers have been a major factor in the flooding there.  Most of the state, which endured a particularly harsh winter, remained under a flood warning Wednesday, with forecasters predicting possibly record flood levels on several rivers.  Snow, which continued to fall Wednesday, complicated preparations, city officials said. \"I woke up this morning and looked outside, I guess I thought of the same thing everybody else did.... [What] came to mind is what a revolting development this is,\" said Mark Voxland, the mayor of Moorhead, Minnesota, a city just outside of Fargo.  Watch flooded fields of snow \u00bb  More than 1,000 people were evacuated from an area near Bismarck on Tuesday night as the Missouri River flooded, Rick Robinson of the North Dakota Department of Emergency Services said Wednesday.  See a map of the affected area \u00bb  Emergency officials said they were particularly concerned about the Red River, which snakes through eastern portions of North and South Dakota and western Minnesota.  The river is expected to crest between 39 and 41 feet in Fargo on Friday, according to Cecily Fong of the North Dakota Department of Emergency Services. The record for the Red River at Fargo was set in 1897 at 40.1 feet, according to Pat Slattery of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.  The threat of flooding prompted authorities to ask for volunteers to fill sandbags either to build temporary dikes or to bolster existing ones. In some areas, even at 3:30 a.m., hundreds of volunteers packed into individual sandbagging centers, an organizer said.  See images of flooding, preparation \u00bb  \"There have been so many volunteers that we had to turn people away,\" said Ryan McEwan, a supervisor at one volunteer coordinating center. \"It is very busy. They are filling sandbags as fast as they can.\"  As of late Tuesday, Fargo residents and out-of-town volunteers had filled more than 1 million sandbags out of the needed 2 million. Fargo Deputy Mayor Tim Mahoney said he hoped that goal would be met by Thursday.  Fargo's mayor, Dennis Walaker, said Wednesday that his city was about 95 percent prepared for the flooding, which is expected later in the week.  \"I went and looked at the dikes this morning, and they're significant, absolutely significant,\" he said in a briefing Wednesday morning.  However, he said, \"We have some areas we need to shore up.\"  Just south of Fargo, authorities said they had rescued several people in Oxbow, a town of about 238 people, after a residential dike gave way.  In some places, water had reached halfway up residents' basement stairs, and in others, it had reached the main level of homes, Sgt. Gail Wichmann said.

{"article": "Fort Lauderdale, Florida (CNN) -- Just taking a sip of water or walking to the bathroom is excruciatingly painful for 15-year-old Michael Brewer, who was burned over 65 percent of his body after being set on fire, allegedly by a group of teenagers.  \"It hurts my heart to see him in pain, but it enlightens at the same time to know my son is strong enough to make it through on a daily basis,\" his mother, Valerie Brewer, told CNN on Wednesday.  Brewer and her husband, Michael Brewer, Sr., spoke to CNN's Tony Harris, a day after a 13-year-old boy who witnessed last month's attack publicly read a written statement:  \"I want to express my deepest sympathy to Mikey and his family,\" Jeremy Jarvis said. \"I will pray for Mikey to grow stronger every day and for Mikey's speedy recovery.\"  Jarvis' older brother has been charged in the October 12 attack in Deerfield Beach, Florida.  When asked about the teen's statement, Valerie Brewer -- who knows the Jarvis family -- said she \"can't focus on that.\"  \"I would really like to stay away from that because that brings negative energy to me and I don't need that right now,\" she said.  Her son remains in guarded condition at the University of Miami's Jackson Memorial Hospital Burn Center. He suffered second- and third-degree burns over about two-thirds of his body, according to the hospital's associate director, Dr. Carl Schulman.  The teen faces a lifelong recovery from his injuries, Schulman told CNN's Harris.  \"Michael's still got a lot of major surgery ahead of him, a lot of rehabilitation and therapy,\" Schulman said. \"He's doing about as well as could be expected at this point in his recovery, but he's got a period of probably several weeks to a couple of months still left in the hospital if everything goes well, but the recovery is lifelong. This is truly a life-changing event.\"  Valerie Brewer said her son's treatment is excruciating at times. Physical therapy, she said, is \"incredibly painful. He almost cries because it's so painful. He's burned badly on the backs of his knees and every time he moves his knee, it pulls, and if it's healing, it pulls the scab and it cracks, and it starts to bleed.\"  The boy must undergo hour-and-a-half showers, she said, where \"they take a piece of gauze, and they wipe off all the dead skin. They give him painkillers for that, but it's incredibly painful and it breaks my heart every time they have to do it.... That's what we call the torture hour.\"  Heavy metal musician Ozzy Osbourne sent Brewer a CD, and he plays it on a boom box during the showers, she said. \"He focuses on Ozzy, and he gets through his torture hour.\"  Police were able to interview Brewer on Monday for the first time since the incident. Hospital officials have said Brewer can communicate only in one- or two-word answers.  Valerie Brewer would not go into details about what her son told investigators, but said that \"he answered the questions they asked.\"  The interview was emotional for both the teen and the investigators, according to Maria Schneider, a prosecutor with the state attorney's office in Broward County.  \"It was difficult for him to talk about. Difficult for us to listen to,\" she said of the interview. \"Just difficult all around, heart-wrenching. He's doing so much better, but it's such a terrible situation.\"  Denver Jarvis and Matthew Bent, both 15, are accused along with a third teen, Jesus Mendez, 16, of being in a group that poured alcohol over Brewer and set him ablaze in a dispute over $40, a video game and a bicycle. All three pleaded not guilty in an appearance last week in Broward County Circuit Court. If convicted, they would face a sentence of up to 30 years in prison.  Detectives say eyewitnesses told them that Mendez used a lighter to set fire to Brewer after Jarvis allegedly poured alcohol over him. Bent allegedly encouraged the attack, police said. Brewer jumped into a pool at his apartment complex to put out the flames.  Authorities have said Mendez admitted setting Brewer on fire. According to an arrest transcript, the boy said he made a \"bad decision.\"  Jeremy Jarvis was arrested as a juvenile after Brewer was burned and spent about 30 days in juvenile detention. However, prosecutors have not filed charges against him and are still determining how to proceed. He still could be charged, as prosecutors have 90 days from his arrest to decide whether to move forward with the case.  He has not been interviewed by police or prosecutors, Schneider said. \"He has invoked his rights to counsel and has invoked his rights to silence,\" she said.  The boy's attorney, Stephen Melnick, said it appears the younger Jarvis was only a witness to the attack. Broward County schools expelled the seventh-grader after his arrest and he is currently being home-schooled, Melnick said. He described his client was a good friend of Brewer, and said the boy is troubled by Brewer's injuries as well as by his brother facing criminal charges that could land him in an adult prison if convicted.  Valerie Brewer said it was \"heartbreaking\" when she and her husband learned that her son's attackers may have included kids that they knew.  \"But we don't focus on that,\" she added. \"We focus strictly on Michael and his recovery. We don't need any negative energy coming into the recovery so we just stay away from it, period. We don't watch the news because we're living this nightmare and we don't need to see it on the TV. So we just stay away from it and stay positive for Michael.\"  Her son's recovery has been filled with ups and downs, she said.  \"It's been a roller coaster ride, the fear of the unknown,\" she said. \"The first time he spoke to us was joyous but watching him struggle every single day...  \"I'm proud of him, I'm very, very proud of him, 'cause I don't think I could do what he's doing.\"  CNN's Rich Phillips contributed to this report.", "Q": ["Q: Have the teens charged pled guilty?

{"article": "  -- North Korea qualified for the 2010 World Cup finals for the first time since 1966 by battling to a 0-0 draw away to Saudi Arabia on Wednesday night.  North Korea have qualified for the World Cup for the first time since 1966.  The point captured in searing temperatures in Riyadh, saw the Koreans edge into second place in Asian qualifying Group 2 to finish ahead of Saudi Arabia on goal difference and seal their place in the finals.  It means both group winners South Korea, who co-hosted the World Cup with Japan in 2002, and neighbors North Korea will  play in the 2010 showpiece in South Africa.  North Korea coach Kim Yong-Jun Kim had nothing but praise for his players after the final whistle.  \"We focused on the defending as we had come under a lot of pressure from the Saudis and I think our preparation for the game was one factor that earned the victory tonight,\" the North Korean boss told FIFA's official Web site.  \"We monitored the Saudi team from the beginning of our campaign and I noticed that they have a problem in finding good strikers. We battled to qualify for the  World Cup finals and I would like to thank my players for the great performance that they showed during the whole match,\" added Kim.  \"It was so hot in Saudi Arabia and as you know the journey from Korea was long but our belief in the ability of the players snatched the ticket to South Africa,\" Kim stated.  The booking of North Korea's ticket to the finale will see the reclusive nation compete against the world's best despite growing international political concern regarding Pyongyang's testing of a nuclear bomb recently.  Their form in the tournament is one of upsetting the odds after they Italy 43 years ago en route to the quarter-finals.  The home draw sees Saudi Arabia finish in third place to go into the playoffs where they will face Bahrain. The winners will play New Zealand for a place in the finals, while Iran miss out after finishing fourth in Group 2.  Earlier on Wednesday, they were denied a victory in Seoul as Manchester United midfielder Park Ji-Sung scored a late equalizer to give South Korea a 1-1 draw.  Iran took the lead from an own goal early in the second half against the group winners, but Park popped up to score a brilliant 81st minute goal as he beat several men before firing home.  In Group 1, Tim Cahill scored twice as Australia came from behind to beat Japan 2-1 to clinch top spot in the section.  The result was academic as both teams had already sealed automatic qualification for the World Cup finals in South Africa.  Japan went ahead in front of a big crowd of nearly 70,000 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) as Marcus Tulio Tanaka headed home a Kengo Nakamura corner in the 40th minute.  But the Socceroos, who went through qualifying unbeaten, hit back in the second half.  Everton's attacking midfielder Cahill again worked his scoring magic to secure the victory.  He was on target in the 59th and 76th minutes to take his tally to 16 in 33 internationals.  \"This is a step forward for us, it's great to finish top of the group,\" Cahill told FIFA.com after the win, while captain Lucas Neill paid tribute to their opponents.  \"They really played the game with intensity and they were running us ragged for a bit and we couldn't get ourselves in the game,\" Neill said.  Bahrain later clinched third spot in the group and their playoff spot with a 1-0 win over Uzbekistan.

{"article": " -- In trendy neighborhoods of Tokyo customers are lining up for vitamin injections that promise to improve health and beauty.  These intravenous vitamin \"drips\" are part of the latest quick-fix, health fad catching on in Japan: the IV cafe.  Each drip pack contains saline solution and specific vitamins and minerals to target a particular health ailment or beauty concern.  \"I used to take vitamin supplements, but changed to the IV drip because I feel the effects more quickly,\" a 20-something woman at the Tenteki 10 Caf\u00e9 told CNN. She said she receives specific injections to get better skin, burn fat and boost her energy.  There are 10 different varieties to choose from at Tenteki. The \"orange\" variety touts anti-aging properties, loaded with antioxidants. The \"placenta pack\" is said to help rejuvenate and ease muscle stiffness.  Prices range from $20 to $30 per injection, and nurses see about 30 to 40 people each day. Their most common patients are Japanese businessmen who work in the same office building.  \"I see a lot of businessmen who say they don't have time to sleep. They can't take a break from working and get the vitamin drip for an extra kick of energy,\" a Tenteki nurse told CNN.  \"Blue\" is the most requested vitamin pack among these men: a concoction of B1 and vitamin E that claims to offer relief from exhaustion.  Registered nurses and doctors administer the drips at Tenteki, but there's no conclusive medical evidence to back up the health claims.  Many nutritionists actually caution against using injectable vitamin supplements because the quantities are not regulated.  \"More is not necessarily better...some vitamins and minerals can be toxic in high doses,\" particularly the fat-soluble ones which the body stores like Vitamins A, D, E and K, explained Claire Williamson, Nutrition Scientist at the British Nutrition Foundation.  In Europe and the United States vitamin shots are popular among celebrities with hectic lifestyles and little time to sleep, particularly vitamin B 12.  Former Spice Girl Geri Halliwell and singer Robbie Williams have both confirmed they've used the shots as part of their diets to maintain stamina during tours.  Dermatological injections of Vitamin C are also popular among women hoping to keep their skin looking young. Former supermodel Cindy Crawford has admitted using such injections to keep her skin firm and wrinkle-free.  According to Williamson, it does not matter if supplements are injected into the vein or into the skin. \"At the end of the day it will go into the blood stream,\" she said.  Most of these nutrients we can get sufficient from foods, nutrients tend to be better absorbed by the body if they are consumed in foods.\"", "Q": ["Q: What do nutritionists warn?

{"article": " -- Bea Arthur, the actress best known for her roles as television's \"Maude\" and the sardonic Dorothy on \"The Golden Girls,\" has died of cancer, a family spokesman said Saturday.  Bea Arthur, right, with \"Golden Girls\" co-star Rue McClanahan in June 2008.  She was 86.  Spokesman Dan Watt said that Arthur died Saturday morning at her home in Los Angeles, her family by her side.  She is survived by her sons Matthew and Daniel and grandchildren Kyra and Violet, he said.  No funeral services are currently planned, Watt said, adding that the family asked that donations be made to either the Art Attack Foundation or PETA in lieu of flowers.  Arthur's opinionated Maude first appeared on Norman Lear's \"All in the Family\" as Edith Bunker's cousin, and was so popular that Lear created a spin-off series.  In the '70s, \"Maude\" was ahead of the social curve, tackling hot topics not usually mentioned on situation comedies -- pornography, race relations and, in an episode titled \"Maude's Dilemma,\" abortion.  That episode spawned demonstrations and generated hate mail for Arthur -- when Maude and husband Walter (Bill Macy) decided on that episode they were too old to raise a child.  But many saw Maude as an enduring icon for women's liberation -- a big deal for the shy, Jewish girl born Bernice Frankel in New York City.  During the Depression, Arthur's family left the Big Apple and opened a clothing store in Cambridge, Maryland. By the time she was 12, Arthur was nearly 5 feet, 10 inches tall, and self-conscious about her height.  But she masked her insecurity with comedy and eventually returned to New York to study acting. Along the way, she had a short-lived marriage she never spoke about, but she kept the last name -- Arthur.  The young Bea Arthur earned a living singing and doing stage work on Broadway and off-Broadway. Critics delighted in her haughty, serpent-tongued deliveries.  Her first television appearance came in 1951 in a long-forgotten series called \"Once Upon a Tune,\" but she quickly made a name for herself with appearances on \"Studio One,\" \"Kraft Television Theatre\" and \"The Sid Caesar Show.\"  Arthur drew attention in \"Threepenny Opera\" on Broadway with Lotte Lenya, but she really turned heads in 1964 originating the role of Yente the Matchmaker in \"Fiddler on the Roof.\"  In 1966, Arthur won a Tony Award for the caustic Vera Charles in the play \"Mame,\" playing opposite Angela Lansbury in the title role. Eight years later, she reprised the role in the film version opposite Lucille Ball, but by then she was already well-established as Maude.  Arthur left \"Maude\" in 1978, making television and some film appearances afterward. She starred in a short-lived series, \"Amanda's,\" in 1983 and then joined the cast of \"The Golden Girls\" in 1985 with Betty White, Rue McClanahan and Estelle Getty.  Her role as Dorothy Zbornak gave Arthur her other major television success as one of four older women living together in Florida. (Getty played Arthur's mother). The role earned Arthur a second Emmy -- the first was for \"Maude.\"  Arthur left the show after Dorothy remarried at the end of the 1991-92 season. White, McClanahan and Getty continued for another season on the show, renamed \"The Golden Palace,\" but the show lasted only one season without Arthur.  Arthur entered semi-retirement after the show ended in 1992, returning to television in sporadic guest appearances and appearing at several celebrity roasts. In the early part of this decade, Arthur appeared in several one-woman shows.  Her last stage appearance was in 2006. Her last television appearance was on \"The View\" in 2007.", "Q": ["Q: Bea Arthur dies of cancer at age 86? A:", "Q: Who died of cancer at age 86? A:", "Q: Who has died at 86?

{"article": "MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN) -- A legislative candidate was killed, along with his wife and two children, bringing campaigns for statewide offices in the southeastern state of Tabasco to a halt, the state-run news agency Notimex reported.  PRI candidate Jose Francisco Fuentes Esperon was killed, along with his wife and their two sons.  The bodies of Jose Francisco Fuentes Esperon, his wife and two young sons were found inside their home in the capital of Villahermosa on Saturday.  According to local reports, Fuentes' wife was shot in the head, and the boys, ages 10 and 13, had been asphyxiated. Less clear was the candidate's fate. Some reports said that his body had signs of torture and had a wound on his neck, which may have been from a gunshot.  As of Sunday, authorities had not released a motive for the crime, though speculation of a drug cartel hit or a robbery circulated in Tabasco.  Fuentes' party, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, immediately announced a campaign moratorium for all of its candidates for the state's October 18 elections. Other political parties followed suit.  \"The PRI cannot go out at this moment and ask citizens for their vote when it finds itself with a broken heart because of the homicide of its candidate,\" Tabasco PRI director Adrian Hernandez Balboa said, according to Notimex.  In response, the Tabasco state government offered all political candidates protection during their campaigns if they requested it, a statement from the office of Gov. Andres Granier Melo said.  Mexican President Felipe Calderon called Granier to offer his condolences and show his support for the investigation, the statement said.  The weekend slaying was not the first time an entire family has been killed in Tabasco.  In February, a Tabasco police official who had arrested a drug trafficker a week earlier was killed together with his mother, wife, children and nieces and nephews.

{"article": " -- British author J.G. Ballard, whose boyhood experience in a World War II internment camp became the novel and film \"Empire of the Sun,\" died Sunday at age 78, his literary agent said. He had suffered from cancer for several years.  Ballard's semi-autobiographical \"Empire of the Sun\" was made into a movie by Steven Spielberg.  \"J.G. Ballard has been a giant on the world literary scene for more than 50 years,\" Margaret Hanbury said Monday.  \"His acute and visionary observation of contemporary life was distilled into a number of brilliant, powerful novels, which have been published all over the world.\"  Ballard was born in a Western enclave in the Chinese city of Shanghai in 1930. The Japanese occupied the city in 1937, and Ballard and his family were placed in a civilian internment camp in 1943.  He began writing science fiction in the 1950s, with his work taking on a strongly psychological, apocalyptic bent in later decades.  But, \"Empire of the Sun,\" his semi-autobiographical account of the war years, became his best-known work, and it was made into a film by director Steven Spielberg in 1988.

{"article": "SEOUL, South Korea (CNN) -- Stalinist North Korea deployed new medium-range ballistic missiles and expanded special forces training during 2008, South Korea's defense ministry reported.  North Korea's reclusive leader Kim Jong-Il  The missiles can travel about 3,000 kilometers (1,900 miles), possibly putting U.S. military bases in the Pacific Ocean territory of Guam within striking distance, the Ministry of National Defense said in its 2008 Defense White Paper, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported Monday.  The paper, published after weeks of delay, calls the North's 1.2 million-strong military an \"immediate and grave threat,\" according to Yonhap.  The report adds that the North has recently bolstered its naval forces, reinforcing submarines and developing new torpedoes, in addition to increasing its special forces training after reviewing U.S. military tactics in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Tension between Pyongyang and Seoul has increased in recent weeks, with North Korea announcing it would scrap peace agreements with the South, warning of a war on the Korean peninsula and threatening to test a missile capable of hitting the western United States.  U.S. and South Korean officials have said that North Korea appears to be preparing to test-fire its long-range missile, the Taepodong-2. Pyongyang tested one of the missiles in 2006, but it failed 40 seconds after launch.  The missile is thought to have an intended range of about 4,200 miles (6,700 kilometers), which if true, could give it the capability of striking Alaska or Hawaii.  North Korea has been involved in what is known as the six-party talks with the United States, Japan, Russia, South Korea and China, which is an effort to end the nation's nuclear program, which the U.S. says is linked to nuclear weapons.

The Navy says this shows a trawler crew member using a hook to try to snag the Impeccable's towed acoustic array.  \"Chinese aggression, from aboard the USNS Impeccable,\" one member of the American ship's crew is heard narrating. \"Details at 11.\"  The Pentagon has raised concerns about a March 8 incident in which \"increasingly aggressive\" Chinese ships harassed the Impeccable, an unarmed survey ship with a mostly civilian crew.  China's government accused the ship of violating Chinese and international laws during its patrols, which took place more than 100 miles off the Chinese coast.  \"The U.S. claims are gravely in contravention of the facts and confuse black and white and they are totally unacceptable to China,\" Ma Zhaoxu, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, said after news of the incident emerged.  Five Chinese vessels shadowed the Impeccable, with two of them closing to within 25 feet while their crews waved Chinese flags and stripped down to their underwear in a sign of disrespect. The Impeccable also turned fire hoses on one of the ships \"in order to protect itself,\" the Pentagon said.  The Pentagon said the Chinese also attempted to snag the sonar equipment that the ship was towing behind it, leaving crew members discussing possible orders to destroy the equipment at one point.  \"Lou and Wilson man the hoses while the Chinese irritate us to tears,\" the video's narrator reports. \"Here he comes for another swipe at the array cable.\"  Watch Pentagon video of Impeccable incident \u00bb  The 281.5-foot Impeccable is one of six surveillance ships that perform military survey operations, according to the Navy.

It carries a crew of 20 mariners, five technicians and as many as 20 Navy personnel.

{"article": "CAIRO, Egypt (CNN) -- Egypt is suspending ties with France's famous Louvre museum until the latter returns artifacts that it knew were stolen when it purchased them, the head of the country's antiquities council said Wednesday.  Egypt accuses the Louvre museum of failing to make good on promises to return antiquities.  Zahi Hawass, director of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, said he wrote a letter seven years ago to major museums around the world asking them to consult with Egyptian authorities before buying any ancient Egyptian artifacts from outside sellers.  Hawass said the Louvre had bought five murals chipped off the walls from a tomb in Thebes and been stolen by antiquities robbers in the 1980s.  He sent a letter to the Louvre a year ago asking that the stolen paintings be returned, he said.  The museum promised to return the items but has not followed through, he said. Until it does so, Egypt will suspend its cooperation with the Louvre, Hawass said.  A Louvre spokesman declined to comment on Egypt's claims.  Egypt maintains antiquities exchange programs with museums around the world. The Louvre is one of the biggest repositories of ancient Egyptian antiquities in the world, much of it treasure taken during the time of the French and British occupation of the country.  Egypt's position is that artifacts taken by European powers during that period are a fait accompli, but anything taken illegally since Egypt's independence must be returned.  This has been one of the major emphases of Hawass since he became head of the Supreme Council of Antiquities in 2002.  Egypt took similar steps against museums in England and Belgium in the past.

{"article": "Editor's Note: This is the second in a five-part series exploring Judge Sonia Sotomayor's background and life with those who know her, and revealing the experiences that might shape her views as a Supreme Court justice if confirmed.  Sonia Sotomayor, here at her 8th-grade graduation, had to finish homework and chores before she could go out.  BRONX, New York (CNN) -- The teenage Sonia Sotomayor was easy to spot in the halls of her New York high school.  Her uniform was often askew -- a once-crisp shirt protruding out and over her skirt's waistband as she carried a pile of books.  \"She was focused so much on learning that she didn't notice,\" Mary Procidano, a classmate at Cardinal Spellman High School, recalled recently.  Sotomayor, now nominated for the Supreme Court by President Obama, seemed to hit her stride at Spellman, a rigorous Catholic institution and educational oasis in a crime-stricken neighborhood of the Bronx.  The schoolgirl first appeared shy and reserved, friends remember. But they soon got to know her as a hard-nosed, strong-willed girl, happy to debate friends, family or teachers.  \"When she opened her mouth and she spoke, she really felt whatever it was,\" said Jeanette Valdespino-Torres, a childhood friend.  \"And she wasn't just talking out of the top of her head -- it was something that she read, she studied, she looked, she knew. She would get into conversations at that age that I couldn't even touch.\"  Watch friends remember Sotomayor as a teenager \u00bb  In the lunchroom Sotomayor would \"hold court,\" various friends from her school years told CNN, sharing opinions on policies and social problems.  She even led discussions around her home, an apartment in the sprawling 28-building Bronxdale Housing project that was so rife with drugs and crime that police often locked it down on Saturday nights, Sotomayor said in one speech.  If she is confirmed by the full Senate Sotomayor, now 55, would be the first Latina Supreme Court justice. President Obama has spoken of her \"inspiring life's journey.\"  Sotomayor's 1972 graduating class knew they were a generation facing \"change,\" said Jeri Faulkner, who was a freshman when Sotomayor was a senior. It was a time when the Vietnam War and social and economic strife were in the news daily.  \"There was a lot of change and turmoil, and they were very involved in it -- very, very involved in social issues; very, very ready to change the world,\" Faulkner, now Cardinal Spellman's Dean of Students, said of Sotomayor's class. \"And Sonia, she was at the forefront of those discussions.\"  A fixture on the debate team and in student government, Sotomayor was even a part of change inside Cardinal Spellman -- helping to write a unified constitution when male and female classes merged in 1971.  Outside school, Sotomayor spent some vacations working at the United Bargains store in the Bronx, though she has admitted she was too young for a job. She also worked.with her mother at Prospect Hospital.  See photos of Sotomayor throughout her life \u00bb  Hard work was a fixture of the Sotomayor household. Juan Sotomayor, Sonia's father, died when she was 9, leaving her mother, Celina, to fend for Sonia and her younger brother, also named Juan.  Celina Sotomayor started at the hospital as a telephone operator and later became a registered nurse. She worked long hours to earn enough to send her children to better schools like Cardinal Spellman, which now boasts of its graduate with a banner on its pale brick facade. And she used spare money to buy the neighborhood's only encyclopedia.  Sonia's mother was clear in what she expected from her daughter, said Valdespino-Torres. When she got home from work and stepped into the brick building, she always asked Sonia if she had done her homework, food shopping or laundry.  \"Only then, Sonia would be allowed to go out,\" Valdespino-Torres said.  Watch Valdespino-Torres take a walk around the girls' old haunts \u00bb  \"Going out\" sometimes meant reading for grade-schooler Sonia Sotomayor. She turned to books for solace after her father died -- a loss that came a year after she was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes. She has needed daily insulin injections ever since.  But sorrow and challenges were not something she shared, Valdespino-Torres said: \"That must have been very difficult at her age to deal with, and it was something that just never really came up. She took care of it and she dealt with it.\"  Sotomayor swapped Nancy Drew mysteries with her friends and loved talking about them, Valdespino-Torres said. Later she would become engrossed in \"Perry Mason\" and the workings of courts.  Watch Juan Sotomayor say how his sister forced him to watch 'Mason' \u00bb  In the summer, Sotomayor and Valdespino-Torres would sit on the stone steps of Blessed Sacrament -- Sotomayor's Catholic grade school.  Their parents kept watch from two-story duplex houses and through the black, steel bars of public housing apartment windows as the girls listened for hours to the latest vinyl records -- The Four Tops, The Rascals, The Beatles and Frankie Valli.  Sotomayor even coaxed some girlfriends to play baseball -- almost in the shadow of Yankee Stadium. (Many years later, Sotomayor would make a famous ruling that effectively ended the Major League Baseball strike.)  Sotomayor also spent time with her cousins, who lived in now-dilapidated apartments marred by broken windows. Entertainment might have been their grandmother calling bingo as they marked their cards with chickpeas.  It was with her cousins that Sotomayor embraced her Puerto Rican roots, she has said.  The neighborhood still boasts a heavy Latino population -- with many Puerto Rican flags in windows. Sotomayor says the sights and sounds of the neighborhood have stayed with her: salsa beats and laughter from Saturday movies featuring Mexican comedian Cantinflas.  The Bronx streets around Southern Boulevard were the center of young Sotomayor's world, but her curiosity was sparked by the No. 5 train creaking along tracks visible from her grandmother's window. At first she just made faces at riders, she has said, but then she began to wonder where the people were going.  Sotomayor's childhood friends say now that they knew even then that she would someday be one of those people going places.  See how Sotomayor is similar to the Supreme Court justices \u00bb  \"Especially because of her pure intelligence, her work ethic, her seriousness and focus,\" Procidano said. \"You kind of visualize a certain trajectory for people, and you say with Sonia, 'Well, I'm not surprised. Isn't that where she was going?'\"  Faulkner, her high school classmate, added: \"I saw her as leader, for sure... They were teenage attributes at the time, but they were there.

Police estimated that as many as 50,000 members of the group United Front for Democracy Against Dictatorship were at the Rajprasong intersection in the heart of Bangkok.  They forced the closure of luxury shopping malls, blocked entrances to five-star hotels and made access to a holy shrine difficult.  A spokesman for the government's peacekeeping operations, Col. Sansern Kaewkamnerd, said that the protesters had \"incited and created a situation which has caused great inconvenience to the conduct of business and the pursuit of normal activity.\"  He said that the gathering was not considered to be a \"peaceful demonstration sanctioned by the constitution.\"  The government's Center for Administration of Peace and Order (CAPO) announced a clause to the country's Internal Security Act on Saturday night that makes unlawful gatherings punishable by up to a year in prison and a fine.

The visit was commemorated by the town council with the unveiling of a plaque at the home of his great-grandfather and by making Ali the first honorary \"freeman\" of the town.

{"article": "HARARE, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- A desperate Zimbabwean farmer fighting to hold onto his land -- a year after the country's political rivals pledged to govern jointly -- fears he will eventually lose to politics and violence.  Ben Freeth's farm was gutted by fire, as was his father-in-law's.  The power-sharing agreement included an undertaking by both parties to ensure property rights are upheld but farm attacks and invasions continue unabated in Zimbabwe.  Charles Lock is one of an estimated 400 farmers who have remained in the country despite President Robert Mugabe's policy of redistributing white-owned farms to landless blacks.  \"Why do they want to remove me when I've complied with everything they want? What more do they want other than for me to pack my bags and leave and if that's the case, then admit that that is the policy. Pass a law: no whites are allowed to farm. Then it makes it clear,\" Lock said.  Since 2000, Mugabe's controversial land reform program has driven more than 4,000 commercial farmers off their land, destroying Zimbabwe's once prosperous agricultural sector.  \"When the land reform program began, we decided we were not going to have a confrontational attitude; that we would actually go along with this program because it was the only way that this whole thing would be sorted out. So I voluntarily gave away my own farm and moved onto my father-in-law's farm,\" Lock said.  That was in 2002. A year later the government came knocking on his door again, he said, demanding more land.  Lock told CNN he eventually gave up 70 percent of his father-in-law's farm, which he then owned. Now an army general is demanding Lock's remaining 30 percent.  When Zimbabwe's new unity government was formed -- with Mugabe's ZANU-PF and Morgan Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic Change -- in February this year, the general allegedly posted soldiers on Lock's farm. The farmer said he stopped farming and trade at gun point.  When CNN visited Lock's farm this month, workers were standing idle. Maize and tobacco, which Lock said is worth more than U.S. $1 million, lay in storage.  \"They've switched off our irrigation system, taken out keys and stop our trucks if we want to deliver maize,\" he told CNN.  So Lock had to sneak into his own property like a thief by cutting open the gate leading to his store room. He took a few valuables from his workshop suspecting that his whole place will soon be looted.  With the formation of a unity government farmers were hoping for some protection but Lock said: \"Nothing is happening here. There is no land audit happening, no one comes out here to check, to see. We are just left vulnerable.\"  On another farm, Ben Freeth's fight for his land has just escalated to another level.  Freeth has been repeatedly beaten, arrested and harassed. Now his farmhouse and that of his father-in-law have been gutted by a mysterious fire. See the destruction the fire caused  Freeth could not say for sure that this is arson but told CNN that the group of ZANU-PF youths who have occupied his farm have repeatedly threatened to burn his house.  \"One time they came round with burning sacks at night and they started making a huge noise and ringing a great big bell and shouting and screaming. They were going underneath the thatch saying we are going to burn your house down if you don't get out,\" he said.  Freeth and his father-in-law Mike Campbell are among a group of Zimbabwean farmers who won the right to remain on their land at a southern African tribunal.  But Mugabe has declared the ruling null and void and pulled out of the tribunal. Farmers cannot contest land issues in Zimbabwe and approaching international courts has thus far not worked either.  When CNN interviewed Mugabe's minister of state, Didymas Mutasa, about the disregard for human and property rights on the farms, he blamed the farmers for the violence, saying landless blacks are getting frustrated with their refusal to relinquish their land.  \"Human rights are beginning to be seen now because they benefit the whites, and when they were affecting blacks badly as they did the likes of us, it didn't matter and nobody raised anything about those human rights.  \"And sometimes we say, good heavens, if that is the kind of human rights you are talking about, you better keep them away from us; we don't want to see them,\" he told CNN.  But it is black farm workers who are caught in the cross fire. They continue to bear the brunt of the land reform program by repeatedly being beaten and intimidated. Some have even been killed.  Tractor driver William Kale said it is farm laborers working for white farmers who are targeted.  \"They actually say you the workers, you are ones that are supporting the white farmer. That is why he is carrying on farming and we refuse to go because we have nowhere to go,\" Kale told CNN.  Many farmers and farm workers we spoke to say they are in a worse position now under the unity government than they were before.  Lock said: \"When ZANU-PF was in power, you had hawks and doves in government and the doves were approachable and often helped us. But now that these positions are being shared with Mr. Tsvangirai's MDC, Mr. Mugabe has only appointed hawks to his cabinet who insist on continuing the land reform program. And when it comes to the MDC, the land issue seems to be a hot potato they do not want to touch. I have asked Mr. Tsvangirai to intervene but nothing is happening.\"  Prime Minister Tsvangirai refuted that. \"That is not true,\" he said. \"We initiated to find out who is being affected, the few remaining white farmers. Let's be frank here, we are talking of farmers as being white, but to me any destruction of farm production affects the whole viability of agriculture. There should be no disruption of any farm activity.\"  To those under siege these words are little comfort as they continue to fight a battle they are unlikely to win.", "Q": ["Q: how many farmers have been affected since 2000?

{"article": " -- Sharp-witted. Direct. In control. Loyal.  Jenny Sanford, here with her husband, was a Wall Street executive before she married Mark Sanford.  That's how friends describe Jenny Sanford, the wife of Gov. Mark Sanford, who confessed to the nation in a rambling news conference that he was having an affair with a woman in Argentina.  Jenny Sanford, unlike so many wives of cheating politicians, was not there facing the cameras, standing beside her husband.  A reporter asked the governor if he and his wife of 20 years were separated.  \"I'm here, and she's there,\" he replied.  As romantic e-mails between her husband and his mistress were published by a local newspaper Thursday, the state's first lady, a former Wall Street executive, stayed far away from reporters. She was at the family's home on Sullivan's Island in South Carolina with her four sons and a few friends.  \"Don't you know that is what Jenny Sanford is about? That is what is authentic about Jenny Sanford. She is not going to humiliate herself by standing next to a story,\" said Cyndi Mosteller, a friend of the Sanfords since 1992 and the former first vice chairwoman of the South Carolina GOP.  \"She will stand next to Mark emotionally, but she cannot stand in the glare of others,\" Mosteller continued. \"She is out there taking a dignified road, one that is defined by principle, even if her heart might have difficulty following that principle. But her overriding priority is to protect her children.\"  Jenny Sanford released a lengthy statement late Wednesday making clear she had learned of her husband's infidelity before his recent secret trip to Buenos Aires. His whereabouts were a mystery for six days, leaving his family in the dark and creating a power vacuum and considerable confusion in the Capitol, with aides telling reporters he was hiking on the Appalachian Trail.  \"When I found out about my husband's infidelity I worked immediately to first seek reconciliation through forgiveness, and then to work diligently to repair our marriage,\" she wrote. \"We reached a point where I felt it was important to look my sons in the eyes and maintain my dignity, self-respect, and my basic sense of right and wrong. I therefore asked my husband to leave two weeks ago.  \"This trial separation was agreed to with the goal of ultimately strengthening our marriage. During this short separation it was agreed that Mark would not contact us. I kept this separation quiet out of respect of his public office and reputation, and in hopes of keeping our children from just this type of public exposure.\"  Mosteller's brother-in-law was with Jenny Sanford on Thursday as the e-mails penned to \"Maria\" became public. The messages from Mark Sanfordcompliment the woman on her \"tan lines\" and \"gentle kisses.\"  The e-mails were published by The State newspaper in Columbia, South Carolina's capital, which said the governor's office confirmed they are authentic. When contacted by CNN, the governor's office would neither confirm nor deny their authenticity.  \"[The e-mails] are almost like reading a novel that you would embarrassed to buy,\" Mosteller said. \"To be one of his four children and know that is there for the world to see, it is incredible to all of us.\"  Jenny Sanford grew up in Winnetka, Illinois, and earned a degree in finance from Georgetown University. She met Mark Sanford when they worked for investment firms in New York, she at Lazard Freres and he at Goldman Sachs. The two married and moved to his native South Carolina, and she managed his campaign for Congress in 1994.  \"Mark started out with five other opponents, and he didn't really have a shot. That was the opinion of most people,\" Mosteller said. \"But she and Mark worked together and turned that thing around so that candidate three, four and five ended up throwing their support behind him, and he won.\"  The two are equals intellectually, according to people who know them.  She went on to manage his gubernatorial campaign in 2002, turning her home into campaign headquarters.  Jenny Sanford was more than a visible first lady of South Carolina; she was involved in the finances of her husband's office to an extent that drew heated criticism from his opponents.  She also took a $70,000 deficit from the operations of the governor's mansion and put its finances into the black.  \"I pretty much am in his office in the mornings most days, and I do pretty much anything he wants me to do for him. I help to bridge the gap between things that have been commonplace themes in his life and make sure everybody in the office is on pace with his agenda,\" Jenny Sanford told Charleston's Post and Courier in June 2005.  The governor told the newspaper that his wife is \"particularly good with financial analysis [and] working with numbers.\"  She took up health as a key issue in her role as first lady, advocating nutrition, exercise and cancer prevention, serving on major boards and speaking at various functions to raise funds for disease research.  \"This is a classy woman who lacks pretension,\" Mosteller said. \"I took a road trip with her last year, and she just automatically got into the back seat. When we were making a lot of appearances, and the schedules were hectic, she called and said, 'I've figured out that the key is changing your deodorant.'  \"Jenny is someone you can talk politics with, you can talk about grand issues with, and you can also discuss deodorant,\" Mosteller said. \"She's a remarkable, classy woman with a lot of integrity who is trying to keep it together.\"", "Q": ["Q: What is the governor's campaign?

{"article": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- Billionaire Bill Gates has urged industrialized nations to honor aid pledges to developing nations despite the recession.  Bill Gates Thursday said industrialized nations need to do more to help developing countries.  ONE, the advocacy group backed by Gates and rock musicians Bob Geldof Bono released a report Thursday attacking several Group of Eight nations for meeting financial aid goals, set in 2005, to countries in sub-Saharan Africa.  The report said that Italy, host to the next G8 summit, has \"performed especially poorly\" in its share of aid spending and that France has fallen behind on its commitment.  In an interview with CNN's Richard Quest, Gates said nations such as France had not been able to fulfill their promises due to pressures on budgets and suggested they needed to \"raise the priority so the promises are met.\" Are G8 nations doing enough during the recession to help developing economies?  The former Microsoft chief set up the philanthropic Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in 1994. Part of its remit is to help nations trapped by hunger and extreme poverty, donating billions of dollars on health aid during the past two decades.  Gates said that as industrialized nations cut their budgets over the next few years to get deficits down there would be a real question of whether aid money will be untouched or increase.  But if people knew how valuable such aid was, he said, the pressure on governments would be enough to allow it to be a priority.  \"When you get young girls into schools and they're literate,\" said Gates, \"not only do they contribute to the economy, but the population growth that is overloading resources and is creating these problems, that starts to go down. And so the portion of the world that needs aid is far less today than it was 50 years ago.\"  Watch full Quest Means Business interview with Bill Gates. \u00bb  Trade was also key to developing nations being able to become self-sufficient, said Gates, rather than relying on foreign aid or philanthropy.  \"Why did China get to the point it got to?\" Gates asked. \"Aid was part of it but they got their governance and infrastructure up to a level where they are now going to be a net contributor. That's a very positive story for 20 percent of the world.  \"We need to improve the trade rules,\" said Gates. \"The Doha Round would have been very beneficial to Africa. That's a failure that one hopes would be fixed.\"  Gates, answering a question submitted by CNN viewer Jairo Martinez on how aid money was monitored, said that health priorities such as AIDs treatment, vaccines and malaria nets were all measurable.  \"My foundation says for every dollar we put in, how many lives have we saved? And, as you save lives, amazingly you actually reduce the population growth and improve the entire ability of the country to move forward.\"  CNN viewer Phill Elliott asked Gates, through a submitted question, about the importance of the $100 laptop, intended to improve access to education in developing nations.  Gates replied that educational technology was a priority once more fundamental basics were in place. \"You have got to get your priorities right,\" he said. \"When children are dying and vaccines that only costs dollars aren't being delivered, that's the most important thing. If you do not have food, that's the most important thing.\"", "Q": ["Q: What country does Bill Gates thinks has made great progress in recent times? A:", "Q: What do Bill and Melinda send?

{"article": "Beirut, Lebanon (CNN) -- Air traffic controllers in Lebanon were telling the pilot of an Ethiopian Airlines flight to change course shortly before it crashed into the sea, the country's transportation minister told CNN Tuesday.  An international search team was combing Lebanon's Mediterranean coastline for signs of life Tuesday amid fears that all 90 people aboard the Addis Ababa-bound airliner perished in the accident, authorities said.  Lebanese Transportation Minister Ghazi al-Aridi said Tuesday it was too early to determine whether pilot error had caused the crash.  He said the plane's flight data and cockpit voice recorders would need to be recovered to determine why Flight 409 disappeared from radar screens shortly after taking off from Beirut's Rafik Hariri International Airport at about 2:30 a.m. local time.  The control tower lost contact with the plane before it made a course correction Monday, al-Aridi said.  In a statement, Ethiopian Airlines said the pilot of the flight had more than 20 years of experience flying various aircraft with the airline's network. The plane had been declared safe and fit to fly following a regular maintenance service on December 25, 2009, the airline said.  The Lebanese military reported Tuesday that 14 bodies had been found -- nine fewer than an earlier count. Confusion early in the search led to double-counting, they said. No survivors have been found.  The search included aircraft from the United States, Britain, France and Cyprus.  The U.S. military sent the USS Ramage -- a guided missile destroyer -- and Navy P-3 aircraft in response to Lebanese requests for assistance, according to U.S. defense officials.  \"We don't believe that there is any indication for sabotage or foul play,\" Lebanese President Michel Suleiman said Monday.  The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board is also sending an investigator because the plane was made by a U.S. manufacturer.  The Boeing 737-800 had eight crew members and 82 passengers -- 51 Lebanese nationals, 23 Ethiopians, two Britons and citizens from Canada, Iraq, Russia, Syria, Turkey and France -- when it went down, the airline said.  The plane crashed about 3.5 kilometers (2 miles) west of the town of Na'ameh which is 15 kilometers (9 miles) south of Beirut.  Government-owned Ethiopian Airlines is one of the largest carriers in Africa, serving Europe and three other continents. The airline has experienced two fatal crashes since 1980.  In November 1996, a flight bound for Ivory Coast was hijacked by three men who demanded that the pilot fly to Australia. The pilot crashed while attempting an emergency landing near the Comoros Islands off Africa. About 130 of the 172 people aboard died, according to published reports.  And in September 1988, a flight struck a flock of birds during takeoff. During the crash landing that followed, 31 of the 105 people aboard died.

{"article": " -- An Arkansas man suspected in a shooting that killed one soldier and wounded another at a Little Rock military recruiting center was angry over the treatment of Muslims, authorities said Tuesday.  Pvt. William Long, 23, of Conway, Arkansas, was killed in Monday's attack.  Abdulhakim Bledsoe, 23, of Little Rock, also told police he recently watched a video \"pertaining to subversive activities which spurred him to commit this act,\" according to court documents.  Bledsoe pleaded not guilty at his arraignment Tuesday and was ordered held without bail.  He faces one count of capital murder and 16 counts of engaging in a terrorist act, said Little Rock Police Chief Stuart Thomas. The terrorist counts stem from the shots fired at an occupied building.  Watch scenes from Tuesday in court \u00bb  Before the not guilty plea, authorities said Bledsoe waived his Miranda rights after the shooting Monday and gave a video statement indicating that \"political and religious\" motives were involved.  He \"stated that he was a practicing Muslim... that he was mad at the U.S. military because of what they had done to Muslims in the past,\" homicide detective Tommy Hudson said in a police report.  Bledsoe told police \"he fired several rounds at the soldiers with the intent of killing them,\" according to Hudson's report.  The suspect is a Muslim convert who has also gone by the names Carlos Bledsoe and Abdulhakim Mujahid Muhammad. He changed his name from the latter April 23, citing religious reasons, court records show.  A leader of the Muslim community in Little Rock said he did not know Bledsoe.  The suspect had been under investigation after visiting Yemen, a federal law enforcement official said. The official declined to provide further information.  Police believe the shooter acted alone \"with the specific purpose of targeting military personnel,\" Thomas said.  Kent Krause, Bledsoe's public defender, said a formal hearing would be held for his client, but no date has been set.  Residents left flowers and miniature American flags outside the recruiting center after the shooting. A lone candle burned on the sidewalk next to bouquets of white and red roses. A note that said \"Thank you for your service\" was attached to the flowers.  The shooting Monday killed Pvt. William Long, 23, of Conway, Arkansas, and wounded Pvt. Quinton Ezeagwula, 18, of Jacksonville, Arkansas, who were outside the military recruiting center.  Bledsoe told police he was driving around and saw Long and Ezeagwula smoking outside the building, according to Hudson's report. He said he pulled into the parking lot and shot the two soldiers and added that \"he would have killed more soldiers if they had been on the parking lot,\" according to the report.  Ezeagwula was in stable condition Tuesday, the police chief said.  The soldiers were part of a recruiting program called \"hometown recruiting assistance,\" said Lt. Col. Thomas F. Artis, commander of the Oklahoma recruiting battalion that oversees the Little Rock Army-Navy recruiting center.  Under the program, soldiers tell their stories to potential recruits. It's a volunteer position taken while soldiers are visiting or based back in their home region, Artis said.  \"I'm relieved there's a suspect in custody,\" said Capt. Matthew Feehan, commander of the recruiting center. He said several people were in the building at the time of the shooting, but nobody else was injured.  Bledsoe was arrested after officers on Interstate 630 pulled over his car, which matched witnesses' description of a black Ford sport utility vehicle seen leaving the scene of the shooting.  Police recovered three guns from the suspect's vehicle -- an SKS semi-automatic rifle, a.22-caliber rifle and a.380-caliber automatic pistol, Thomas said.  The victims were shot with an SKS rifle, according to the police report.  Police also seized from Bledsoe's vehicle and apartment several rounds of ammunition, two homemade silencers, handwritten notes in Arabic, CDs with handwritten Arabic labels, a computer and cell phones, according to court documents.  Melvin Bledsoe of Memphis, Tennessee, was listed on the police report as Bledsoe's father.

{"article": " -- Cal Ripken Jr. will always be known for his consecutive games played streak, but it may surprise many people that just two years into his big-league career, he already was planning for life after baseball.  Cal Ripken Jr. is introduced to the crowd at the 2002 All-Star Game in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  While many of the athletes who took to the playing fields of major league baseball this season only are focused on the game, Ripken began saving and planning for retirement long before his career neared its end.  \"When I joined the Orioles [in 1982], the team was transitioning,\" said Ripken, who will be inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in July. \"I saw guys who were 34, 35, 36 years old -- still young guys -- about to get out of the game, and I wondered what will they do now?  \"It got me thinking about what I would want to do when I got out of the game. Most people don't realize how fast the time goes, but I turned those questions on myself.\"  Though he quickly points out that he didn't dwell on those questions, Ripken admits it got him thinking, and eventually planning, so that when retirement came in 2001, the shift from baseball to business was easy.  \"From the outside, I'm sure it looked like a smooth transition just by virtue of the fact that I had another thing to go into,\" he said. \"I had prepared for what was next.\"  These days, five seasons after retiring from a 21-year career he spent with the Baltimore Orioles, Ripken is a businessman, team owner, radio-show host and author. He also will be a baseball analyst for TBS, which like CNN.com is owned by Time Warner.  Ripken jumped full time into his company, Ripken Baseball, without taking any break, lessening the emotional jolt of retirement.  \"I didn't give myself the luxury of taking a month off [after the baseball season],\" he said. \"I think I would have opened myself up to regret, thinking about the past. I had to get a minor league baseball team in that stadium. I just put my head down and started working.\"  Ripken's first post-baseball venture was developing a youth ballpark in his hometown of Aberdeen, Maryland, financed in part by a $75,000 gift from the Major League Baseball Players Association. It was presented to him the night he broke Lou Gehrig's record for consecutive games played.  Ripken was a \"rookie\" for the second time in his life, this time in business. \"I was learning all over again, learning what was important,\" he said. \"The off-season never went by so fast. I had meetings, phone calls, plans and long days in the office.  \"By the time I looked up, [the Orioles] were at spring training. I didn't think, 'They left without me,' which is what I thought I would do.\"  Ripken's latest project is a business principles book called \"Get in the Game: 8 Elements of Perseverance That Make the Difference,\" co-authored by Donald T. Phillips.  The book, available April 10, was born out a speech Ripken gave about the \"secrets\" of his success. Writing it turned out to be an emotional journey, he said.  \"I got to reflect on what my parents had taught me, the values and principles, right and wrong,\" Ripken said. \"It's good to be in touch with those things.\"  The fact is, whether in baseball or business, Ripken rarely strays from the principles he learned from his late father, Cal Sr., a former player and manager. The book is filled with anecdotes from on and off the field.  Now 46, Ripken is president and CEO of Ripken Baseball, and his brother, Bill, a former teammate, is executive vice president. The company owns minor league teams in Aberdeen and in Augusta, Georgia. The brothers also have co-written two books on baseball and co-host a baseball call-in show on weekends on XM Radio.  There were reports in December that Ripken was heading a group that was interested in buying the Orioles, but Baltimore owner Peter Angelos denied that claim.  \"There is no question that Cal and I have a great relationship,\" Angelos told The (Baltimore) Sun. \"He was a great player for the Orioles, and I have an affection for him. But what's being reported, there is simply no substance to it. It has not happened. There have been no such discussions.\"  Still, Ripken said he probably would \"stick his nose in\" if the Orioles became available.  Ripken, who has a boy and a girl, also has ventured into children's literature, and his first book is scheduled to be released Thursday. \"The Longest Season\" tells the story of the 21-game losing streak Ripken and his Orioles teammates endured in 1988 and teaches the lessons of perseverance.  Ripken also continues his longstanding association with the Boys and Girls Clubs of America through the Cal Ripken Sr. Foundation. The foundation says it has refurbished fields, donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to Boys and Girls Clubs throughout the country and teamed up with Nike to help provide baseball and softball equipment to school sports programs nationwide.  Asked what type of advice he would offer to young professional baseball players, Ripken said, \"Put that [huge contract] aside, save your money, that's your nest egg. In the off-season, think about skill development or the interests you have in a small way but be very careful.  \"You can't think too much about retirement as a young player. You have to live a narrow existence for your sport.\" E-mail to a friend.", "Q": ["Q: What does the former shortstop have lined up? A:", "Q: What does Ripken do now?

{"article": " -- Embattled Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe signed a power-sharing deal with the opposition party's breakaway faction, his party said Tuesday, though Mugabe's opponents denied the claim.  Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe leaves a hotel where negotiations had been taking place Tuesday.  Mugabe's party said the deal, which promises cabinet positions to the splinter group of the Movement for Democratic Change, does not involve MDC head Morgan Tsvangirai.  Tsvangirai said he still is involved with the talks, and that the power-sharing deal with the MDC offshoot is part of larger deal that has not been signed by anyone. Welshman Ncube, spokesman for the MDC splinter group, also said his party has not signed a deal with Mugabe, though Mugabe's party said the deal was signed with the group's chief, Arthur Mutambara.  South African President Thabo Mbeki, the mediator in the talks, would not confirm that a deal had been signed. Mbeki said Mugabe and the splinter group had formed an \"agreement\" and were awaiting Tsvangirai's position on certain points in the plan.  Another high-ranking official with knowledge of the negotiations told CNN that the deal signed with Arthur Mutambara, head of the faction that broke from the MDC, has to do with the prime minister position that will be created in the new Zimbabwe government.  The official said deciding the duties of the new prime minister has been a sticking point in the negotiations. The MDC has wanted the prime minister to be in charge of government and Mugabe to be in charge of the state, the official said.  But Mugabe has sought to keep control of both and make the prime minister position \"ceremonial,\" the official said.  All the parties involved have been meeting in a hotel in Harare, Zimbabwe's capital city. Video footage Tuesday showed Tsvangirai leaving the negotiations stone-faced as he ignored reporters' questions.  Mutambara told reporters he plans to have a news conference Wednesday, and Mugabe smiled widely and shook hands with onlookers as he left the hotel, but did not answer reporters' questions.  Tsvangirai had been in power-sharing talks with Mugabe in recent days as a culmination of his party's protest of Mugabe's disputed re-election in a June presidential runoff. The election was condemned internationally as a sham.  Tsvangirai withdrew from the June 27 runoff days before the vote, saying Mugabe's supporters had orchestrated a campaign of beatings, intimidation and murders against the MDC.  Tsvangirai had garnered the most votes in a March general election, but not enough to avoid a runoff, according to the government's official count.

{"article": " -- Nigeria's main militant group issued a veiled threat Monday against an upcoming world football tournament that is tentatively scheduled to take place in the west African nation later this year.  Militants from the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta, pictured September 2008 in the Niger Delta.  The Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta warned the international football association FIFA that it should \"rethink\" allowing Nigeria to host the upcoming under-17 World Cup series later this year.  \"The safety of international players and visitors can not be guaranteed due to the current unrest,\" MEND said in an e-mail.  Only two out of the nine stadiums in Nigeria are close to being ready for the tournament which is scheduled to take place between October 24 and November 15, according to FIFA. The association has given the country a grace period to start constructing the remaining venues, FIFA Vice President Jack Warner said.  In its e-mail, MEND claimed to have attacked a Chevron oil station in the Niger Delta region Monday as part of its latest offensive against the Nigerian government, dubbed \"Hurricane Piper Alpha.\"  \"Hurricane Piper Alpha hit the Abiteye flow station operated by Chevron today, Monday, June 15, 2009 at about 0200 Hrs triggering another 'systems failure' which resulted in a massive fire outbreak that is consuming the entire facility,\" MEND said.  It threatened further attacks in other states in the Niger Delta region, as well as offshore oil facilities.  Chevron, which halted its onshore operations in the region last month, said it is investigating the reported attack on its Abiteye flow station.  \"We are working to ensure the safety of our people, restore the integrity of our operations as soon as possible and are not speculating on any comment while investigations are being undertaken,\" according to an e-mailed statement from Chevron spokesman Scott Walker.  Last month, the militant group declared an \"all-out war\" on the government after what it said was a deadly bombing raid on civilians.  It is not the first declaration of war by MEND, which demands that more of Nigeria's oil wealth be reinvested in the region instead of enriching those whom the militants consider corrupt politicians.  The militant group declared war against the government in September for what it said were unprovoked attacks. At that time, MEND destroyed several oil facilities, forcing Nigeria to cut its oil exports by as many as 1 million barrels of oil per day, or 40 percent.  The recent violence -- which has included attacks on pipelines and hostage-taking -- has limited shipment of crude oil supplies out of Nigeria, Africa's largest producer.", "Q": ["Q: who is playing in the tournament A:", "Q: Who made recent attacks?

{"article": " -- Actor and producer Anil Kapoor has long been a Bollywood luminary, but after his award-winning performance in global hit \"Slumdog Millionaire,\" he is set to become an international star.  Bollywood superstar Anil Kapoor.  Kapoor says that \"Slumdog,\" a love story about a boy from a Mumbai slum who wins a fortune on quiz show \"Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?,\" resembles his own life story. \"I also started from scratch, went from rags to riches,\" he told CNN.  Anil is part of the Kapoor family that is a veritable Bollywood dynasty. His father Surinder and elder brother Boney are film producers, his daughter Sonam, sister-in-law Sridevi and his younger brother Sanjay are actors, while son-in-law Sandeep Marwah is a movie magnate and Anil's son Harshvardhan is currently learning to direct movies in Los Angeles.  But things weren't always so glamorous. Anil Kapoor was born on Christmas Eve 1959 and grew up in a tenement in the Mumbai suburb of Chembur, with eight people living together in a single room. His father Surinder had yet to make his name in the film industry, but young Anil clearly had movies in his blood. \"In my childhood I was surrounded by films, actors, film makers, directors and film talk. I would bunk school to watch movies,\" he said.  He was cast in his first movie aged just seven. Although the film was never released, the experience was enough to convince Kapoor that his future lay in the movies.  After finishing school he went to St Xavier's College, where he acted in plays and won the Best Actor trophy at an inter-collegiate competition, before being expelled for non-attendance. Kapoor responded by enrolling in acting classes and taking singing and dance lessons.  He made his Bollywood debut in 1979's \"Hamare Tumhare,\" before moving on to Telugu-language movie \"Vamsa Vriksham\" in 1980, and landing his first Bollywood starring role in 1983's \"Woh 7 Din.\"  Watch Anil Kapoor take CNN on a tour of Mumbai. \u00bb  Kapoor first met future wife Sunita Bhambhani in 1979, when she was a successful model and he was still a struggling actor. He decided that he would propose marriage as soon as he got his big break and 1984's \"Mashaal\" was the opportunity he'd been waiting for. Kapoor's performance won him Best Supporting Actor at India's prestigious FilmFare awards and he married Sunita in May of that year.  Kapoor cemented his status a Bollywood idol after starring in the hugely successful \"Mr India,\" which promptly became his nickname among a growing legion of fans. He has gone on to become one of the biggest names in Indian cinema, picking up a total of five FilmFare awards and a National Film Institute Best Actor award for his role in 2000's \"Pukar.\"  Following in his father's footsteps, Kapoor made his debut as a producer in 2002, with the comedy \"Badhaai Ho Badhaai,\" and he went on to produce \"Gandhi, My Father,\" which portrayed the fractious relationship between Mohandas Gandhi and his eldest son Harilal.  For years now, in his home town of Mumbai Kapoor has been mobbed by fans wherever he goes, instantly recognizable by his trademark mustache, which he has proudly sported in all but three of his hundred-plus movies.  But like most Bollywood stars, he received little acclaim outside India. That changed abruptly and unexpectedly with the release of low-budget British movie \"Slumdog Millionaire.\" The film has become an international sensation, winning four Golden Globe awards and receiving an astonishing 10 Oscar nominations.  See Anil Kapoor's \"Slumdog Millionaire\" success in photos. \u00bb  Kapoor's role as the creepy quiz show host earned him a share in the Screen Actors Guild award for Best Cast. In typically modest fashion, Kapoor dedicated the award to the film's child actors. \"They deserve this award\" he said during his acceptance speech. \"It's the children who've done it, not us.\"  Kapoor remains proud of his roots, visiting his childhood neighborhood every year, and he is grounded enough to be aware of the social problems in Mumbai. He is a goodwill ambassador for Plan India, an organization that helps street children, and he donated his entire \"Slumdog\" fee to the cause.  As he prepares to travel to Britain for the Bafta awards and to Los Angeles for the Oscars, Mr India remains characteristically self-effacing. \"I feel so humble and grateful. I never expected the film to be so huge and successful,\" he said.  Whether he's accepting awards in Hollywood or making movies for Bollywood, Kapoor seems sure to keep his feet on the ground.", "Q": ["Q: What did Kapoor sat regarding the film's success?

{"article": "(MentalFloss.com) -- 1. The oldest documented bikinis -- haute, bandeau-style little numbers -- show up in a 1,700 year old Roman mosaic entitled Chamber of the Ten Maidens. A bevy of ancient, bikini-clad babes are depicted playing sports.  2. Earlier this year, Brooklyn-based designer Andrew Schneider invented the first solar powered bikini -- the \"iKini\" -- which produces enough electricity to power an iPod during a sunny day at the beach. Just remember to unplug it, the inventor says, before taking a dip.  3. The famous white belted bikini worn by Ursula Andress in the 1962 James Bond hit \"Dr. No\" sold for $61,500 at Christie's in London in 2001. Halle Barry modeled a redux of a similar suit in the 2002 Bond flick, \"Die Another Day.\"  4. French designer Jacques Heim's first itsy-bitsy bathing suit hit the fashion scene in 1946. Tapping into the worldwide obsession with nuclear physics, he named his tiny invention the \"atom.\" A few months later, another French designer, Louis Reard, one-upped Heim, revealing an even tinier suit, which he dubbed the \"bikini\" after Bikini Atoll, the island in the Pacific where the U.S. had tested the atom bomb. The new swimsuit, it was said, was as small as an atom and just as powerful.  5. Reard said a two-piece bathing suit couldn't be called a bikini \"unless it could be pulled through a wedding ring.\"  Mental Floss: Waitresses, bridesmaids, compulsory plastic surgery  6. In 2009, Americans spent $4.3 billion -- roughly $400 million more than the GDP of Barbados -- on swimwear alone.  7. The 19th-century version of a bikini was made out of either heavy flannel or wool -- fabrics that would not be transparent when wet -- and covered the entire body from neck to toe. The suits were so heavy that women had to hold onto ropes strung from the beach to offshore buoys to keep from sinking.  8. The bikini rocketed to fame in 1960 with Brian Hyland's hit single, \"Itsy Bitsy Teeny Weeny Yellow Polka Dot Bikini.\" The famous 30 inches of fabric didn't debut on the cover of Sports Illustrated until 1964.  Mental Floss: 25 brand names mistakenly used as generic terms  9. At the 1964 International Beauty Pageant in Long Beach, California, Miss Austria stormed out of a photoshoot after being told she could not wear her homemade bikini. \"Americans are rude,\" she said. \"I'm tanned all over, so I wanted the suntan to show.\"  10. In 2009, a group of vegetarian ladies campaigned in international cities wearing bikinis made only of lettuce leaves. The \"Lettuce Ladies\" as they were called, were sponsored by the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, and hoped to convince people to adopt a meatless diet.  Mental Floss: When did women start shaving their armpits?  11. In 1993, the Olympic Committee decreed the bikini the official uniform for women's beach volleyball, partly because of the functionality of the suit. Athletes complain that when wearing more conventional uniform -- the one-piece, for instance -- \"sand goes down the top and collects in the bottom,\" Holly McPeak, a three-time Olympic vollyballer told ABC News.  With the bikini's built-in sand-release system, Reard, it seems, was ahead of his time.  For more mental_floss articles, visit mentalfloss.com.", "Q": ["Q: What is the 19th century bikini made of?

{"article": "HOLLYWOOD, Florida (CNN) -- The slot machines are ringing, music is blasting at the crowded poolside bar, and people are dancing to celebrity DJs at hip nightclubs. But this is not a scene on the Las Vegas strip. This action is taking place on an Indian reservation.  Richard Bowers Jr. says the Native American Group is intended to help tribes with basic needs.  Business at the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Hollywood, Florida, is booming and contributing to the Seminole Indian Tribe's great wealth.  Now the Seminoles are taking that wealth -- and the power that comes with it -- and using it to do something that has not been done before: organizing Native American tribes with the intent of spreading economic opportunities across Indian Country.  \"Some of these reservations I have been to -- it's like the Third World right here in the United States,\" says Richard Bowers Jr. As president of the Seminole Tribe of Florida Inc., Bowers has oversight over all the Hard Rock caf\u00e9s, hotels and casinos in the world except the caf\u00e9 in London and the casino in Las Vegas.  The Seminole Tribe purchased the Hard Rock properties in 2007 for a reported $965 million.  Bowers, a former alligator wrester and cattle rancher, is thankful for his tribe's success and has used his influence to create a consortium of Native American Tribes called the Native American Group. The goal of this group is to bring tribes throughout the United States and Canada together in an effort to promote Native American-owned businesses and services.  Keeping the dollar within Indian Country, Bowers hopes, will help the less fortunate tribes with basic needs such as housing, food and education.  \"I view this as historic in nature,\" says Donald Laverdure, the chief legal counsel from Montana's Crow Tribe. \"We haven't had first-nation to first-nation actually occur, and now with the success of the Seminoles and others, they have an opportunity to help tribes such as ourselves.\"  The help that the Crow Nation seeks is financial. For the Crow Tribe, gaming is not an option, according to Laverdure.  \"There's less population, so the success in gaming cannot be paralleled as elsewhere,\" he says. \"So we've always viewed our future in energy.\"  That energy would come from coal. The Crow Tribe wants to mine some of the 9 billion tons of coal that it estimates is on its land.  Crow Nation Chairman Cedric Black Eagle hopes the success of his tribe will lie in turning coal into liquid diesel. \"It will open the door for Indian Country in energy fields and help this country start veering away from its dependence on foreign oil,\" he says.  As the group meets to discuss coal, Bowers recalls that it was the need for beef that prompted his idea for the Native American Group.  \"Here we have all these cafes, casinos -- everybody eats a hamburger,\" says Bowers. \"And than (I) realized that we don't have enough beef to supply our own needs, and that's when I reached out to other Native Americans that did have cattle.\"  Bowers discovered there are more than 2 million heads of cattle on Indian land. If there is not enough cattle on Indian land, then members of the group are encouraged to keep the business in the country and buy American.  The Native American Group has come a long way since Bowers was looking for cattle. The group now has more than 100 tribal members and more than 100 Native-owned businesses.  One successful business that joined the group is the largest Native American-owned contractor, Flintco. Robin Flint Ballenger, who is Cherokee, is its chairman of the board.  \"It wasn't a far stretch for me at all to take a risk on this new organization because we are successful, we're doing very well,\" says Ballenger, who adds that a third of the company's work is done for Native America.  One of the projects Flintco is working on is a casino being built on Choctaw tribal land in Durant, Oklahoma.  With every Native American-owned casino, Bowers sees an economic opportunity for all.  \"Trash bags, everybody uses trash bags -- so just for an example, let's all get together and order trash bags and it's going to be cheaper on all of us,\" Bowers says, pointing out that there is a Native American trash bag supplier.  When discussing the potential of the Native American Group, Ballenger remembers something her father used to show her.  \"(He) showed me one stick and [said] you can break one stick easily,\" Ballenger recalls. \"When you bundle many sticks together, it is impossible to break.\"  This is her wish for the consortium -- \"That we will bundle these many sticks together and become impossible to break.\"", "Q": ["Q: What will help less fortunate tribes?

{"article": "(Travel + Leisure) -- With its tranquil beaches, the tiny northern island of Sylt is the country's best-kept summer secret.  An ideal way to see the island -- especially in late summer when the heather is in full bloom -- is by bike.  Where to stay  Long and narrow, and spread over 36 square miles, Sylt has a verdant countryside peppered with its signature low-slung cottages. Many house tiny hotels, like the secluded Dorint S\u00f6l'ring Hof (1 Am Sandwall, Rantum; 49-4651/836-200; doubles from $550), a 15-room inn tucked into the dunes on the southern coast with its own hidden stretch of sugary sand.  For those who want to be closer to the action, there's the Hotel Stadt Hamburg (2 Strandstrasse; 49-4651/8580; doubles from $253), in the charming village of Westerland. You'll have to walk five minutes to the beach, but this tidy hotel, built in 1869, is an ideal base for exploration.  Where to eat  The island's dining scene attracts a number of German celebrities (Claudia Schiffer, Boris Becker), and many frequent the stylish Sansibar (80 H\u00f6rnumer Str., Rantum; 49-4651/964-656; dinner for two $130). The restaurant's North Sea-meets-Asian dishes, like fresh mussels in a sweet curry sauce, are a potent draw.  In Kampen, you'll find Greta's Rauchfang (5 Str\u00f6nwai; 49-4651/ 42672; dinner for two $92) next to Louis Vuitton and Herm\u00e8s. Here, socialites enjoy bottles of Kristall (opened dramatically with sabers), along with small plates of the sweet local shrimp.  To get away from the fabulous set, head to Alter Gasthof (5 Alte Dorfstrasse, List; 49-4651/877-244; dinner for two $65) on the isle's northern tip. This 200-year-old inn dishes out classic regional food, including stellar house-smoked salmon and eel.  What to do  Sylt is known for its nude beaches. The most famous is Buhne 16 (133A Listlandstrasse, Kampen), where Germans of every stripe let it all hang out as they lounge in wicker basket chairs. For those who like things a bit more covered up, try Am Roten Kliff, just north of Kampen, which is also (no surprise) less crowded.  An ideal way to see the island -- especially in late summer when the heather is in full bloom -- is by bike. Fahrrad am Bahnhof (49-4651/5803), in Westerland's main train station, has a terrific rental selection, and the staff will happily suggest a route along Sylt's 136 miles of well-laid-out paths.  Getting there  Sylt is reached by train from Berlin (5 hours) or Hamburg (3 1/2 hours). By car, take the autobahn to Nieb\u00fcll from Berlin (290 miles) or Hamburg (120 miles). There is no road connecting Sylt to the mainland; vehicles board a train for the 30-minute trip to the island. For more, see bahn.de.  Planning a beach getaway?

{"article": "MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN) -- Mexican authorities arrested Vicente Carrillo Leyva, a leader of the Carrillo Fuentes drug cartel, officials announced Thursday.  Vicente Carrillo Leyva is escorted by police at a news conference in Mexico City on Thursday.  Carrillo Leyva was arrested as he exercised in a park in a residential area of Mexico City, where he had been living under the alias Alejandro Peralta Alvarez, officials said.  The federal attorney general's office told reporters he was tracked through his wife, who did not change her name.  Carrillo Leyva \"is considered one of the heirs to the criminal organization known as the Juarez Cartel, after the death of his father, Amado Carrillo Fuentes,\" said Assistant Prosecutor Maricela Morales.  His father died in July 1997 while undergoing plastic surgery to alter his appearance in an effort to avoid capture. Amado Carrillo was known as \"El Senor de los Cielos,\" the \"Lord of the Skies,\" because of the fleet of jetliners he used to transport cocaine from Colombia to Mexico.  Carrillo Leyva, 32, was presented at the news conference, surrounded by black-clad, hooded law-enforcement officials. He wore dark-frame glasses and a white jogging suit with double black stripes on the sleeves. His dark hair was long and shaggy.  Last month, federal officials offered a reward of up to $2.16 million (30 million pesos) for information leading to his arrest. The same reward has been offered for his uncle, cartel leader Vicente Carrillo Fuentes, also known as \"El Viceroy\" and \"El General,\" who remains at-large.  Rewards of $2 million apiece have been offered for 22 other leading cartel suspects.  Wednesday's arrest was the fourth detention of a top drug cartel leader in recent weeks.  Last week, officials announced the arrest of Hector Huerta Rios, also known as \"La Burra\" or \"El Junior,\" a top lieutenant of the Beltran Leyva cartel. He was arrested in the city of San Pedro Garza Garcia in Nuevo Leon state, along Mexico's border with the United States.  The previous week, Mexican authorities announced the arrest of Sigifredo Najera Talamantes, a drug-trafficking suspect accused of attacking a U.S. consulate and killing Mexican soldiers. Talamantes, also known as \"El Canicon,\" also is suspected in attacks on a television station in Monterrey in Nuevo Leon, the state-run Notimex agency said.  That same week, the Mexican military also arrested the son of a top drug cartel lieutenant.  Authorities on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border blame drug cartels for a surge in violence in the region.  Despite the violence, Mexican officials say the country is generally safe and that tourist areas such as Cancun and Acapulco are heavily patrolled. Watch Leyva get escorted by law enforcement officials \u00bb  Officials from Acapulco city hall, the Guerrero state government and the Mexico attorney general went so far as to sign a statement in early March assuring students wanting to go there on spring break that efforts had been taken to ensure their safety.  In a speech in mid-March, Mexican President Felipe Calderon said 93 percent of the 6,500 deaths attributed to organized crime in 2008 occurred among the criminals. Most of the rest were law enforcement authorities, officials have said.  Few civilians are killed, the president said.  In that same speech, Calderon ridiculed those who say Mexico is unsafe.  \"It is absolutely false, absurd, that anyone indicate that Mexico does not have control over one single part of its national territory,\" he said. \"I challenge anyone who says that to tell me what part of the country they want to go to and I will take that person there.\"  Analysts point out that most of the violence is occurring along the U.S. border, particularly in Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua and Tijuana. Drug cartel violence is also found on Mexico's western coast.  \"The situation in Ciudad Juarez is of special concern,\" the U.S. State Department said in a February 20 travel alert. \"Mexican authorities report that more than 1,800 people have been killed in the city since January 2008. Additionally, this city of 1.6 million people experienced more than 17,000 car thefts and 1,650 carjackings in 2008.\"  The State Department advisory tells U.S. citizens how best to remain safe.  \"While millions of U.S. citizens safely visit Mexico each year (including thousands who cross the land border every day for study, tourism or business), violence in the country has increased recently. It is imperative that travelers understand the risks of travel to Mexico, how best to avoid dangerous situations, and whom to contact if one becomes a crime victim. Common-sense precautions such as visiting only legitimate business and tourist areas during daylight hours, and avoiding areas where prostitution and drug dealing might occur, can help ensure that travel to Mexico is safe and enjoyable.\"  CNN's Mario Gonzalez contributed to this story.", "Q": ["Q: How many major suspects were arrested in recent weeks?

{"article": "Manila, Philippines (CNN) -- A Filipino-American woman abducted in July in the Philippines was found Sunday on an island stronghold of the Islamic militant group Abu Sayyaf, police said.  Gerfa Yeatts Lunsmann, 43, was found at Suba Kampong township on the Philippine island of Basilan after her captors released her, said Bienvenido Latag of the Philippine National Police.  The U.S. Embassy in Manila on Monday confirmed Lunsmann's release in Basilan after she was held hostage by a still unidentified group of bandits.  Latag did not say why Lunsmann was released, but the mayor of the town where Lunsmann was taken after she was released said she was freed following negotiations between her husband and her abductors.  Mayor Cesar Lobregat, head of a Crisis Management Committee in Zamboanga City, declined to confirm whether officials paid a ransom.  Fourteen gunmen snatched Lunsmann in July while she was vacationing with her family on the island of Tictabon, authorities said. The gunmen also took hostage Lunsmann's 14-year-old son, Kevin, and her 19-year-old Filipino nephew, Romnick Jakaria, they said.  Authorities said the abductors forced Lunsmann and her family to board awaiting boats, which then sped off in the direction of Basilan.  It was not immediately known whether the captors are still holding Lunsmann's son and nephew.  Lunsmann was adopted by Americans when she was 9 and grew up in Virginia. She eventually married a German citizen. Both she and the son, Kevin, are U.S. passport holders.  Police at the time of the abduction said they suspected the son attracted attention because of his distinctive mixed-race looks in an area with few foreign tourists.  Basilan serves as a base for Abu Sayyaf, which wants to establish a separate state for the Philippines' minority Muslim population. The U.S. State Department considers the group a terrorist organization and says it is linked to al Qaeda. The Philippines government has been fighting to contain the militants.  Abu Sayyaf has been blamed for several terrorist attacks in the Philippines, including the bombing of a ferry in 2004 that left about 130 people dead, as well as past kidnappings.", "Q": ["Q: Was she abducted alone?

{"article": "RIVERDALE, Georgia (CNN)  -- In his darkest moment, Kenneth Brown lost it all. His wife and kids, the housebroken dog, the vacation home on Cape Cod all vanished when he was sent to prison for an arson in 1996.  Kenneth Brown, a former inmate, learned to meditate during his nine years in prison.  Trapped in his gloomy cell and serving a 20-year sentence that felt like an eternity, Brown, then 49, found himself stretched out on the floor. He was silent. His eyes were shut. His body did not move.  Brown, a man raised as a Baptist and taught to praise the Lord and fear the devil, was meditating.  \"I try to focus on the space between two thoughts, because it prevents me from getting lost,\" said Brown, who discovered meditation, yoga and Buddhist teachings three months into his sentence.  \"This helped me stay on track and get me through prison,\" he said.  Eastern religions encompassing meditation techniques have captivated hippies, 20-somethings and celebrities like actor Richard Gere. But since the 1960s, the art of meditation also has found a growing number of unlikely followers behind prison bars.  The inmates say meditation -- an ancient practice that develops mental awareness and fosters relaxation -- is teaching them how to cope in prison.  \"Mostly, the people in Buddhist community are going into the prisons, providing programs, and word of mouth gets from one inmate to another,\" explained Gary Friedman, communications chairman for the American Correctional Chaplains Association. \"It's a break from all the hustle and noise of the prison environment.\"  There is no group tracking the number of inmates converting to Buddhism or engaging in meditation practices. But programs and workshops educating inmates about meditation and yoga are sprouting up across the country.  Meditation can help the convicts find calmness in a prison culture ripe with violence and chaos. The practice provides them a chance to reflect on their crimes, wrestle through feelings of guilt and transform themselves during their rehabilitative journey, Buddhist experts say.  In the past five years, books like the \"Prison Chaplaincy Guidelines for Zen Buddhism\" and \"Razor-Wire Dharma: A Buddhist Life in Prison\" have emerged.  \"This is transformative justice, as opposed to punitive,\" said Fleet Maull, founder of the Prison Dharma Network, one of the largest support networks helping inmates learn meditation and Buddhist teachings.  Since its inception in 1989, Prison Dharma Network has grown from one person -- Maull -- teaching Buddhist principles to more than 75 member organizations corresponding with 2,500 individuals, many of them inmates.  For the past seven years, Maull's group has taught a weekly meditation class in Boulder County Jail in Colorado.  Some inmates follow Zen Buddhism, a practice that originated in China, and meet weekly to focus their minds. Others practice Vipassana, a Buddhist practice founded in India, which consists of completing hundreds of hours of meditation in a short period of time.  Buddhism has gained momentum in the United States over the past 25 years, becoming the third most popular religion in America behind Christianity and Judaism, according to the 2008 report from the the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life. About 1.7 million Americans call themselves Buddhists, and many of them are converts, the study said. According to the American Religious Identification Survey in 2008, there were 1.2 million self-identified Buddhists.  Some inmates, like Brown, may not label themselves official Buddhists, but they meditate, practice yoga and follow Buddhist principles on truth, responsibility and suffering.  The practice of meditation seeped into the heart of the Bible Belt in 2002. The Donaldson Correctional Facility, a maximum-security prison in Alabama, was notorious for violence. But a group of male inmates, including several murderers, completed a Vipassana meditation retreat that required more than 100 hours of meditation in 10 days.  One inmate, who was featured in the 2007 documentary \"The Dhamma Brothers,\" said Vipassana was harder than the 8\u00bd years he had spent on death row. More than 120 men in Donaldson have gone through Vipassana at least once.  Watch a clip of \"The Dhamma Brothers\" \u00bb  \"They don't feel so close to exploding,\" said Jenny Phillips, director of the film. \"They aren't afraid to have conversations with people and to express themselves. They aren't always on edge.\"  Critics, including some prison officials, doubt that meditation works. They worry that it may be a tactic to convince parole boards to lighten a sentence.  In areas that are heavily Christian, some wardens are uncomfortable with introducing Eastern religions. Alabama prison authorities were initially skeptical about meditation but next year will designate an open dormitory for inmates going through Vipassana, said Ron Cavanaugh, director of treatment for the Alabama Department of Corrections.  He said corrections officers have seen lower levels of violence among Donaldson inmates who meditate.  In California, a state where the swollen prison population has resulted in dangerously overcrowded prisons, teaching conflict management is critical, said Anne Seisen Saunders, a Zen Buddhist instructor who was raised Christian.  Her Prison Meditation Project, based near San Diego, began a decade ago in one prison yard. Today, the program has expanded to five prisons, with an average of 20 inmates participating in each location.  Last week, the autumn sky transformed from a deep purple to light blue outside Kenneth Brown's meager studio apartment. Inside, Brown sat on his bed, barefoot and deep in concentration, in front of a makeshift altar holding books a photo of the Buddha. Traces of incense billowed in the air.  Brown, now 62, resides in Georgia to be near his family. He says he was wrongfully convicted of arson. In 2005, a Massachusetts appeals judge reduced his sentence from 20 years to nine.  His body was motionless, his eyes closed and the palms of his hands facing upward.  These days, Brown's practice of mediation helps him tackle the challenges of being unemployed with a felony record. The college graduate has been rejected from jobs catching stray dogs and cleaning hotel rooms.  But he's got a lot to be thankful for: His daughters, his grandchildren -- and meditation, he said.  \"I finally feel at peace.\"", "Q": ["Q: What is the third most popular religion in the US?

{"article": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A group of student protesters were arrested Sunday after they called on President Bush to end the humanitarian crisis in Darfur, Sudan, and refused to leave the front gates of the White House.  The protesters shouted, \"Hey Bush, you can't hide! Help us end this genocide!\" and \"President Bush! No more excuses!\" Federal police arrested 18 of them after they marched to the White House.  Sunday's protest was one of many scheduled around the world for \"Global Day for Darfur\" to mark five years of ethnic cleansing in Sudan. The conflict has killed more than 200,000 people, and it has made refugees of more than 2 million others.  In London 3,000 protesters gathered at the Sudanese Embassy. Also, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown called for Darfur peace talks.  Watch a report from the protest in London \u00bb  In the U.S., Scott Warren, national student director of the Student Anti-Genocide Coalition, said the students were bringing specific demands to the president, including bolstering the United Nations peacekeeping force in Sudan and stepping up pressure on China, Sudan's trading partner.  \"In your last seven months, you can make peace in Sudan, and this is how you can do it,\" he said.  Warren said the students knew the president wasn't home, but still hoped their message was heard.  Bush was on his way back to Washington from his ranch in Crawford, Texas.  \"It's not something we take lightly, and we do understand the implications of it.

Bush traveled recently to Africa, and spoke about genocide on several stops.  \"We're trying to help them, but the truth of the matter is there are obstacles to peace in Darfur,\" he said at a stop in Tanzania. \"And that is one of the reasons we've imposed tough sanctions -- real, meaningful sanctions against those who are stopping progress toward alleviating the human suffering in Darfur.\" E-mail to a friend.", "Q": ["Q: How many protesters gathered at the Sudanese Embassy?

{"article": " --   Connie and Donald McCracken were watching CNN one evening last week when they learned of the tragic death of actress Natasha Richardson from a head injury. Immediately, their minds turned to their 7-year-old daughter, Morgan, who was upstairs getting ready for bed.  An injured Morgan McCracken has benefited from awareness after Natasha Richardson's death.  Two days earlier, Morgan, her father, and brother had been playing baseball in the yard of their Mentor, Ohio, home when her father hit a line drive that landed just above Morgan's left temple. A lump formed, but the McCrackens iced it down and the swelling subsided within an hour.  \"For the next two days, she was perfectly fine,\" Donald McCracken says. \"She had no symptoms. She went to school both days and got an A on her spelling test as usual. There were no issues whatsoever.\"  But after hearing about Richardson's death, the McCrackens wondered if Morgan was really as OK as she seemed. After all, Richardson had been talking and lucid immediately after her fatal injury.  When they went upstairs to kiss Morgan good night, she complained of a headache. \"Because of Natasha, we called the pediatrician immediately. And by the time I got off the phone with him, Morgan was sobbing, her head hurt so much,\" McCracken says.  The McCrackens took Morgan to the emergency room at LakeWest Hospital in neighboring Willoughby, where doctors ordered a CT scan and immediately put Morgan on a helicopter to Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital in Cleveland, with her father by her side.  \"I knew it was bad when she had to get there by helicopter in six minutes, instead of the 30 minutes it would have taken to get to Cleveland in an ambulance,\" McCracken said.  When the helicopter arrived at Rainbow, the McCrackens were greeted by Dr. Alan Cohen, the hospital's chief of pediatric neurosurgery. He whisked Morgan into the operating room, pausing for a moment to tell McCracken that his daughter had the same injury as Richardson: an epidural hematoma.  McCracken remembers standing in the emergency room, feeling like the life had just been sucked out of him. \"My heart sank,\" he says. \"It just sank.\"  Unlike Richardson's, Morgan's story has a happy ending. After surgery and five days in the hospital, she's at home and doing fine. \"Dr. Cohen told us that if we hadn't brought her in Thursday night, she never would have woken up,\" McCracken says.  Now the McCrackens sometimes wonder if they waited too long to get Morgan to a doctor. After hearing about Richardson's death, many people are asking themselves the same question: Do all head injuries need attention, even ones that seem minor?  \"Sometimes there's a gray zone, and there's no right answer,\" Cohen says.  Watch for tips on when to go to the ER \u00bb  In most cases, it's pretty clear when someone needs medical attention after a head injury, says Greg Ayotte, a spokesperson for the Brain Injury Association of America and a cognitive rehabilitation therapist. \"They're confused, they're agitated, or they might be dizzy or unresponsive,\" he says.  But then there's what doctors call the \"talk and die\" scenario, where someone seems fine, only to die hours, or sometimes even days later.  \"Talk and die\" can happen with several different kinds of brain injuries. In the case of epidural hematomas, the injury Richardson and Morgan had, blood pools in the area between the lining of the brain and the skull. \"Fluid is building up in a contained space, creating pressure. Something's got to give, and that something is the brain,\" Ayotte says. If you don't get to the hospital to have surgery to drain the fluid, \"the deterioration can happen very quickly.\"  Here, from Ayotte and other experts, is a list of what to do after someone has suffered a head injury.  1. Be vigilant  Keep an eye on someone who has hit his head, even if the person never lost consciousness. \"A lot of folks are still under the assumption that as long as you're not knocked out, you're OK, and that's not true,\" Ayotte says.  2. Look for dizziness, vomiting, headache and confusion  If the injured person has these signs, take him or her to an emergency room, says Dr. Jam Ghajar, clinical professor of neurological surgery at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York, and president of the Brain Trauma Foundation.  3. Look for changes in symptoms and behavior  Any sudden change, such as Morgan's headache going from mild to severe in minutes, means the person needs medical attention. For example, Ghajar says, if a person gets suddenly sleepy in the first 12 hours after a hit, it may mean the parts of the brain responsible for staying awake are experiencing pressure from a bleed.  4. Be especially wary if someone a) has been drinking alcohol, b) is on blood thinners, c) is elderly or d) is a young athlete  It's tough to distinguish brain-injured behavior from drunken behavior, so when in doubt, take the person to the hospital, Ghajar says. Also, blood thinners can turn a mild bleed into a major bleed, so be especially vigilant if the injured person is taking blood thinners such as warfarin.  He also warns people to be extra vigilant when an elderly person hits his or her head. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has information on traumatic brain injury and senior citizens. The CDC also has information on concussions in young athletes.  5. Go to a certified trauma center if you can  The American College of Surgeons has a list of certified trauma facilities; a hospital that's not a trauma center may not have a neurosurgeon on call. You can also look on this map from the American Trauma Society. Find your state, select trauma centers, update the map, and you can find information about trauma centers in your area.  The McCrackens say they look back and still can't believe Morgan suffered such a severe injury and didn't show any signs for 48 hours. \"She didn't black out, her speech wasn't slurred, she wasn't dizzy, she wasn't any of the things you'd expect,\" McCracken says. \"And you don't want to be one of those panicky parents who takes their child to the emergency room all the time.\"  Cohen's advice after a head injury: When in doubt, go. \"It's always better to err on the side of being conservative,\" he says.

{"article": "LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- The Transportation Security Administration said Friday its officers at a Texas  airport appear to have properly followed procedures when they allegedly forced a woman to remove her nipple rings -- one with pliers -- but acknowledged the procedures should be changed.  The woman involved -- Mandi Hamlin -- told reporters earlier Friday she was humiliated by last month's incident, in which she was forced to painfully remove the piercings behind a curtain as she heard snickers from male TSA officers nearby. The incident occurred at the Lubbock, Texas, airport.  The officers \"rightly insisted that the alarm that was raised be resolved,\" the TSA said in a statement posted on its Web site Friday afternoon. \"TSA supports the thoroughness of the officers involved as they were acting to protect the passengers and crews of the flights departing Lubbock that day.\"  However, \"TSA has reviewed the procedures themselves and agrees that they need to be changed,\" the statement said. \"In the future, TSA will inform passengers that they have the option to resolve the alarm through a visual inspection of the article in lieu of removing the item in question.\"  Hamlin and her lawyer, celebrity attorney Gloria Allred, said they want a public apology from the agency, as well as a guarantee that future passengers with piercings will be treated with dignity and respect.  Allred pointed out that TSA's Web site says passengers with piercings can undergo a pat-down inspection if they do not want to take their piercings out -- an option she said Hamlin was never offered.  \"The conduct of TSA was cruel and unnecessary,\" Allred told reporters at a news conference. \"Last time that I checked, a nipple was not a dangerous weapon.\"  She said if an apology was not forthcoming, \"Mandi is going to have to consider her legal options.\"  Attempts by CNN to reach Allred for a response to the TSA statement Friday afternoon were unsuccessful.  TSA said in its statement it acknowledges \"that our procedures caused difficulty for the passenger involved and regrets (the) situation in which she found herself. We appreciate her raising awareness on this issue and we are changing the procedures to ensure that this does not happen again.\"  The incident occurred February 24 as Hamlin, 37, was preparing to fly to Dallas-Fort Worth from Lubbock, where she had been visiting her elderly great-uncle.  Hamlin said she also has navel and ear piercings and has never set off a metal detector or been singled out for additional screening at an airport.  She did not set off the metal detector at Lubbock International Airport, but was pulled to the side for additional screening, Allred said. A hand wand used by a TSA officer beeped when it was waved over her breasts.  Hamlin told the officer she had nipple piercings, Allred said, and that officer called over another officer, who told her she would need to remove them.  \"Ms. Hamlin did not want to remove her nipple piercings,\" Allred said, reading from a letter she sent TSA. \"After nipple rings are inserted, the skin can often heal around the piercing and the rings can be extremely difficult and painful to remove. In addition, once removed, the pierced skin may close up almost immediately, making it difficult and painful to reinsert the piercing.\"  More officers were called over, and the group grew to four male and two female TSA officers, according to Hamlin. Also, a small crowd of onlookers had started to gather. The officers insisted that Hamlin remove the nipple rings, Allred said.  \"She felt humiliated by the scene that the TSA officers were making,\" Allred said.  \"With tears streaming down her face, she again asked to show the piercings to a TSA officer instead of having to remove them. She was told, however, she would not be allowed to fly unless she removed them. Had she been told that she had a right to a pat-down, she would have chosen that option.\"  She eventually was taken to a private area behind a curtain to remove the piercings, Allred said. One came out easily, but the other would not, and she called to an officer that she was having trouble and would need pliers. She was handed a large pair, Allred said.  \"As Ms. Hamlin struggled to remove the piercing, behind the curtain she could hear a growing number of predominately male TSA officers snickering in the background,\" Allred said in the letter.  \"Mandi Hamlin was publicly humiliated.... Clearly, this is not how passengers should be treated.\"  Watch the passenger demonstrate removing the jewelry \u00bb  Afterward, Hamlin underwent another scan, but realized she had forgotten to remove her navel ring. She offered to remove it, Allred said, but an officer told her it was not necessary because he could see it. Hamlin wondered why a similar visual inspection of her nipple rings would not have sufficed, Allred said.  \"I wouldn't wish this experience upon anyone,\" Hamlin told reporters. \"I felt surprised, embarrassed, humiliated and scared.

{"article": "Cairo (CNN) -- Six people were killed and at least 300 were injured when pro-democracy activists clashed Friday with Egyptian security forces in central Cairo, a government official said.  Two of the dead were teenagers and one was an Islamic scholar, said Dr. Hisham Shiha, a spokesman for the Ministry of Health. At least four of the fatalities suffered gunshot wounds, with one person shot in the back of the head, he said.  Adel Saeed, a spokesman for the general prosecutor, said an investigation is under way. \"We are questioning 14 men detained at scene of clashes and we have a team now at two hospitals questioning the injured to understand how the injuries were inflicted,\" he said.  A separate team was at the morgues following up on the deaths, he said.  Meanwhile, people were throwing Molotov cocktails, rocks and glass.  Men wearing what appeared to be military uniforms tossed bricks and concrete on protesters from atop a six-story building. A Ministry of Transportation building burned nearby, and tents in an activist encampment in front of parliament caught fire.  The military fired warning shots into the air and sprayed water cannons to disperse the crowd.  Shiha said nearly 100 people were hurt, including nine who were shot by live ammunition. Saeed said 12 people were charged with destroying public property.  Are you in Cairo? Tell us what the mood is like.  A Ministry of Interior official denied police were involved.  \"This situation has nothing to do with the police or the Ministry of Interior, and we do not have forces at the site of the clashes,\" said Gen. Marwan Mustapha, a ministry spokesman.  A doctor at a clinic said he had treated dozens of protesters for cuts and injuries caused by flying glass and rocks.  \"It all started when the military arrested one man, and then an hour later he emerged from building barely able to walk from the beating,\" said activist and video blogger Walid Nada. \"His face and body and clothes (were) blotched with blood as the protesters carried him to (a) makeshift hospital.\"  Activist Mona Seif identified the beaten man as Aboudi Ibrahim. He \"has no broken bones, but major bruises to the face, cuts and harsh burns from electric shockers. We are filling a police report soon,\" she said.

{"article": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- British broadcaster Channel 4 has been criticized for creating a new television show which looks at how children as young as eight would cope without their parents for two weeks.  Channel 4 said the program was made with the parents' full consent.  Boys And Girls Alone -- which will be aired in the UK on Tuesday evening -- has been compared to adult reality show Big Brother.  The show allows 10 boys and 10 girls between the age of eight and 11 to create their own mini-societies, organizing everything from what they eat to how they should entertain themselves.  Ultimately the children are shown on camera squabbling over sleeping and cooking arrangements and, as they split into factions, some of them feel \"picked on,\" the show's publicity says.  This has led to a stream of criticism from British lawmakers and children's charities, who have labeled Channel 4's \"experiment\" a disgrace that \"served no purpose other than to cynically boost ratings,\" according to Britain's Daily Mirror newspaper.  Camila Batmanghelidjh, of the charity Kids Company, was quoted by The Daily Mirror as saying: \"Any situation that leaves a group of young people without the mediating presence of a responsible adult is cruel and abusive.\" Do you agree? Share your views  Labour MP Denis MacShane told the newspaper that \"children should be protected and not exploited for commercial gain.\"  However, Channel 4 defended the show and said it features \"the kind of tussling you'd get in any playground -- but no physical violence.\"  It added that one boy pointed a knife and fork during the series but emphasized that no one was in any danger, Britain's Press Association reported.  \"This is not a project for commercial gain.

{"article": "  -- Stop, speed racers, stop.  Police say the cars were pulled over on a dangerous stretch of Highway 18 near Grand Ronde, Oregon.  So said Oregon State Senior Trooper David Petersen after he was able to catch up with six exotic sports cars on a stretch of Highway 18 near Grand Ronde on Thursday, according to a news release.  Perhaps a more amazing feat was that he stopped all the cars simultaneously.  \"They just were all good little soldiers and pulled right over,\" Oregon State Police spokesman Lt. Gregg Hastings told CNN.  One of the drivers was later cited again on a different highway.  The drivers of the cars -- consisting of Ferraris, a Lamborghini and an Acura NSX -- told Petersen they were part of a group of 20 similar cars making an annual road trip, the news release said.  They were all cordial and cooperative, and were cited with speed racing, a class A traffic violation that can command a fine of $627, Hastings said.  After receiving reports Thursday morning that several sports cars were speeding and passing in no-pass zones west of Grand Ronde, Petersen set up east of the casino town, near McMinnville, and waited.  Five of the cars soon blew past him, running about 100 mph in a 55-mph zone, Hastings said. As Petersen pulled onto Highway 18 in pursuit, a sixth car passed him.  \"I guess when you're going too fast, you're in a rock and a hard place,\" Hastings said.  Highway 18 runs from Dayton, Oregon, in the Willamette Valley to the Pacific coast. The stretch where the cars were cited is considered particularly dangerous and the Oregon Department of Transportation provides additional funding to enforce traffic laws there, Hastings said.  About two hours after the incident, another trooper pulled over the Lamborghini from the group in Multnomah Falls, about 90 miles east. The driver of the car, which bore the the license plate \"BADBUL,\" was cited for driving 90 in a 65-mph zone, according to a news release.", "Q": ["Q: What brand were most of the sport cars?

{"article": " -- A former Alabama judge is standing trial on charges he checked male inmates out of jail and forced them to engage in sexual activity such as paddling in exchange for leniency.  Former Mobile County Circuit Judge Herman Thomas denies all the charges, his attorney says.  Former Mobile County Circuit Judge Herman Thomas at one point faced more than 100 criminal counts in the case, including kidnapping, sexual abuse, extortion and sodomy. Prosecutors filed cases relating to 15 alleged victims, with multiple counts in each case.  But four of those cases have been dismissed -- some thrown out by a judge because the statute of limitations expired and others because prosecutors decided not to present evidence relating to them -- leaving 11 alleged victims and 51 counts, according to defense attorney Robert Clark and CNN affiliate WKRG-TV.  Retired Marengo County Judge Claud Neilson dismissed jurors Tuesday while attorneys argued whether the jury should be allowed to consider kidnapping, extortion or assault charges, WKRG reported. Neilson already has ruled there is enough evidence for jurors to consider the sex abuse charges.  Thomas, 48, has pleaded not guilty and has denied any wrongdoing. Clark told CNN on Tuesday that Thomas was trying to mentor the inmates and did not assault them.  \"The whole thing is, he tried to help people in this community,\" Clark said. \"He helped thousands to grow up and be productive citizens.\"  The judge does not deny bringing the inmates into his office, Clark said. \"He was mentoring them. He was trying to get them to do right, to be productive citizens.\"  One of the alleged victims testified Monday that he doesn't know why his semen was found on the carpet of a small room used as an office by Thomas, according to The Mobile Press-Register newspaper. But he did say Thomas spanked him with a belt on several occasions, the newspaper reported, and that the paddlings took place inside a jury room, in the small office and at a Mobile fraternity house.  Another man testified that after he was charged with kidnapping and robbery in 2002, Thomas visited him in jail and urged the man to let Thomas decide the case instead of a jury, according to the Press-Register. Thomas convicted him of lesser charges, he testified, and sentenced him to a 90-day boot camp. He said Thomas also beat him with a belt on his bare buttocks about a dozen times at the courthouse, the newspaper reported. Neither man was identified.  \"All of them [the alleged victims] were given preferential treatment at some point,\" Nicki Patterson, chief assistant district attorney for Mobile County, told CNN earlier this month.  \"And ultimately, when some of them refused to continue participating [in the activities], they were given what I would view as excessive sentences. But certainly while the inmates were involved with the activities we allege, the state would say, it was extremely lenient sentences.\"  However, \"two of the individuals said he [Thomas] did nothing bad to them,\" Clark said Tuesday. \"That he didn't paddle them. That he only helped them.... I mean, the last guy that testified was a murderer. And he's complaining he got assaulted. 'I got assaulted,' -- yeah, right.\"  Asked whether Thomas admits paddling the men, Clark said, \"I didn't say either way.... I'm saying there ain't no sexual innuendoes.\"  Neilson has heard arguments on whether an expert should be allowed to testify about sexual fetishes for the prosecution. Clark said the expert has not interviewed any of the alleged victims and that he fails to see how the testimony fits into the case.  Neilson was brought in to hear the case after all the Mobile County Circuit judges recused themselves -- standard procedure in a case involving another judge.  Thomas resigned from the bench in October 2007 before he was scheduled to stand trial before the Alabama Court of the Judiciary on multiple ethics violations charges. The complaint, dismissed after the resignation, accused him of \"extrajudiciary personal contact\" with some defendants but does not refer to any sexual contact.  In April, Thomas told WKRG the allegations against him are false, but the most important thing for him was making sure his wife and two daughters were taken care of.  \"I'm not guilty, and I look forward to being a part of the community that's supported me and I've supported my entire life,\" he said.  The Alabama State Bar suspended Thomas' law license in January after a grand jury handed up the first of two indictments against him. In April, the bar's disciplinary commission upheld the suspension, WKRG reported, despite the fact that Thomas under oath denied all the allegations in the first indictment. The second indictment was returned in August.

{"article": "Newark, New Jersey (CNN)  -- A Transportation Security Administration officer has been reassigned after Sunday's security breach at Newark's Liberty International Airport, according to the TSA.  \"The TSA is reviewing the circumstances surrounding the incident, and we are making an assessment as to what disciplinary action will be taken against [the] officer posted at the exit in question,\" TSA spokeswoman Ann Davis said. \"For now, that officer is performing non-screening duties while we look at what happened.\"  Davis confirmed Monday that the TSA had not been able to locate the individual who breached security, but there was no indication that the individual presented a serious threat, she said.  \"We were able to eliminate that he was a risk to the airport by rescreening everyone and re-combing the airport to make sure he didn't introduce anything to the environment or hand anything off to anyone,\" she said.  The incident Sunday evening forced the closure of a terminal for hours while authorities rescreened thousands of passengers.  The security breach happened about 5:20 p.m. at Terminal C when a man walked through an exit on the public side to the secure \"sterile\" side for passengers who had cleared screening, according to the TSA.  All passengers had been rescreened by early Monday, according to the TSA. Flights from Terminal C were grounded until the process was completed.  Authorities reviewed video from airport cameras but were not sure whether the man was once on the sterile side and went back or whether he never went through screening, Davis said.  The incident caused arrival delays and mainly affected Continental Airlines, which is the airport's largest tenant.  iReport: Passenger photographs massive crowd  CNN's Alina Cho, who arrived at the airport Sunday night on a flight from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, described a hectic scene, saying many passengers who had boarded outgoing flights had to get off planes to be rescreened.  \"I just saw one woman pleading with a gate agent, saying that she had two small children and a heart condition -- that she simply could not take this,\" Cho said. \"But of course, there will be no exceptions.\"  Newark Liberty International Airport, about 15 miles from Manhattan, is the second-largest hub for Continental.

{"article": " -- Alicia A.S. Duque knew she had some pounds to lose, but she had no idea how much being overweight affected her until the television cameras started rolling.  Alicia Duque performs with her partner on Oxygen's new hit \"Dance Your Ass Off.\"  \"Going into it, I knew it was a TV show, I knew it was a weight-loss show and I knew it was a dance show, but I didn't think I was going to learn so much about myself through the process,\" said the 23-year-old Duque, a contestant on the new show \"Dance Your Ass Off.\" \"I didn't know how many issues and problems I had with my weight until I faced it on the show.\"  Duque's struggle with weight loss is one of many on television that is resonating with those tuning into programming aimed at and featuring the plus-sized.  Style Network's \"Ruby,\" NBC's \"The Biggest Loser,\" Lifetime's \"Drop Dead Diva\" and Fox's forthcoming dating show \"More to Love\" all center on the overweight and are tapping into an audience that can relate to the desire to shed a few pounds.  Obesity has risen dramatically in the United States during the past 20 years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  And this year television has seen an increase in shows featuring participants and stars who look more like the viewing public.  Oxygen Channel's \"Dance Your Ass Off\" combines elements of ABC's \"Dancing With The Stars\" and NBC's \"The Biggest Loser.\" Contestants learn dance routines for which they are judged before weighing in to determine how much they have lost.  Amy Introcaso-Davis, senior vice president of original programming and development at Oxygen, said dance and diet are two areas of interest for younger viewers of the channel, so combining the two made sense.  The 12 contestants, from the smallest to the largest, have struck a chord with viewers, she said.  \"People find the contestants so relatable,\" she said. \"We cast very purposely across the board in terms of how many pounds people needed to lose -- we had anywhere from people who needed to lose 40 [pounds] to over 150.\"  The premier of \"Dance\" rated highly for Oxygen, with more than 1 million viewers tuning in.  Oxygen also found success earlier with \"Mo'Nique's F.A.T. Chance,\" a plus-size pageant where women of substance strutted their stuff to be crowned \"Miss Fabulous And Thick.\"  For a nation grappling with obesity, Introcaso-Davis said, there is a hunger for such shows.  \"If you have five pounds to lose or you have 150 pounds to lose, it's something you think about all day long,\" she said. \"You take a bite of cheesecake and you think 'Should I be doing this?' \"  Esther Rothblum, a professor of women's studies at San Diego State University and co-editor of the forthcoming anthology \"The Fat Studies Reader,\" said she wonders if part of the appeal of plus-sized shows stems from the overweight being held up for public ridicule. The subject of her book is an emerging field that has been defined as \"confronting and critiquing cultural constraints\" against notions of \"fatness\" and \"the fat body.\"  \"Most people feel too fat in this country and are made to feel very unhappy with their bodies,\" she said. \"So by portraying somebody who weighs so much more than they do, it's almost a way to make the audience feel like 'I could look worse' or 'At least I'm not them.' \"  Ruby Gettinger said she supports any show that does not mock the overweight.  Her hit show \"Ruby\" started out as a documentary and has transformed Gettinger into a reality star who has lost more than 100 pounds and appeared on \"Oprah.\"  \"We are really all on this journey together, and I tell [viewers] that all of the time,\" said Gettinger, who at her heaviest weighed 716 pounds. \"There are a lot of shows out there and I think people are trying to find a way to beat it and lose weight.\"  Gettinger, who is traveling around the country walking in various cities to inspire fans to become more active, said shows featuring the obese can really touch the audience if they are authentic.  \"[My show] is the truth, not to say that the others aren't,\" she said. \"When I started out on this journey and met with Style [Network, which airs the show] I said 'I have to keep my truth because this is about my journey and addiction and I want to deal with that because too many people are struggling.' \"  Her show portrays her grappling with everything from temptation to embarrassment at having to visit the gynecologist, but Gettinger said it's all worth it if it inspires others.  Actress Marissa Jaret Winokur, who starred in the Broadway musical \"Hairspray,\" said she agreed to host \"Dance Your Ass Off\" because she saw the potential for inspiration in viewers witnessing overweight people being active and feeling confident and sexy -- even in skimpy dance outfits.  Reality television has become so popular because viewers are attracted to watching real people, and there is a craving for viewers to see folks like themselves, she said.  \"It became that so many people on reality shows were only beautiful skinny people, and I think a lot of people got sick of that,\" said Winokur, who has been blogging about her own struggles with weight for People magazine. \"Really, who's home watching TV is the everyday person who is not a TV model.

{"article": " -- Now that Arizona lawmakers have passed what's considered some of the toughest immigration legislation in the country, other states are watching to see whether they should follow in the state's footsteps or stand back.  Arizona's bill orders immigrants to carry their alien registration documents at all times and requires police to question people if there's reason to suspect they're in the United States illegally. It also targets those who hire illegal immigrant day laborers or knowingly transport them.  Critics, including immigrant advocates and the American Civil Liberties Union of Arizona, are concerned that the legislation will foster racial profiling, arguing that most police officers don't have enough training to look past race while investigating a person's legal status.  The bill made it through the state Senate on Monday after it was passed by the state House last week. It's now awaiting the signature of Republican Gov. Jan Brewer. Supporters of the measure expect her to sign it. Latino members of Congress are calling on Brewer to veto it.  Michael Hethmon, general counsel for the Immigration Reform Law Institute, helped draft the language of the Arizona bill. The institute is the legal affiliate of the Federation for American Immigration Reform.  On the heels of the Arizona initiative, Hethmon said he has been approached by lawmakers from four other states who have asked for advice on how they can do the same thing where they live. He declined to identify the states, citing attorney-client privilege.  \"Arizona was meant to be the leading edge,\" Hethmon said. \"If you are going to work on developing a state-based response to this enormous problem -- the lack of a national immigration policy -- Arizona is the place to do it.\"  Hethmon pointed to Arizona's history of citizen ballot initiatives in support of immigration reform, noting that \"what's happening in Arizona just didn't pop out of nowhere. It's the latest step in a fairly deliberate process.\"  Republican State Rep. Russell Pearce, who sponsored the legislation in Arizona, said the four initiatives he put on the 2006 ballot regarding illegal immigrants passed by an average of 75 percent.  State laws relating to immigration have increased in recent years, according to numbers from the National Conference of State Legislatures.  In 2005, 300 bills were introduced. The next year, that number nearly doubled, and in 2007, more than 1,500 bills were introduced. Another 1,305 were introduced in 2008, and about 1,500 were considered in 2009.  About 15 percent of those were enacted, dealing with issues such as driver's licenses, health and education.  About1,000 bills have been brought up so far this year.  Hethmon cited the election year, the Democratic leadership's position on the issue and the tough economic times as catalysts for introducing legislation.  \"Historically, not only in the U.S. but in virtually all industrialized nations, when the unemployment rates go up... the public becomes much less sympathetic toward programs which bring in large numbers of foreigners as workers and economic players,\" he said.  Whether Arizona becomes the standard-bearer on illegal immigration depends on the fate of the legislation, said Ann Morse, the program director of the National Conference of State Legislatures' Immigrant Policy Project.  \"Certainly states will look at it, but not in a rush,\" she said. With court challenges promised from opponents, states will be watching to see if the legislation is deemed constitutional and if it's costly, Morse said.  Omar Jadwat, the staff attorney with the ACLU's Immigrants Rights' Project, said following in Arizona's footsteps would take states in the wrong direction.  \"Although we are aware that people are trying to convince other legislatures to go down this path, I think it's clear that both as a policy matter and a legal matter, that Arizona's approach is the wrong one,\" he said.  Isabel Garcia, a legal defender in Arizona's Pima County, blasted the bill as \"the most dangerous precedent in this country, violating all of our due process rights.\"  \"We have not seen this kind of legislation since the Jim Crow laws. And targeting our communities, it is the single most largest attack on our communities,\" she said.  Pearce brushed off her criticism, saying, \" 'Illegal' is not a race, it's a crime.\"  \"We do not tolerate those who break into our country, just like we don't tolerate those who break into our homes,\" he said.  Hethmon praised the legislation as \"the most cost-effective and the most humane way to deal with the illegal immigration problem.\"  \"Every time you convince an illegal alien to self-deport, you bypass having to resort to direct physical deportation,\" he said.  In addition to providing a model for other states, Hethmon said the legislation in Arizona and other bills in the works in other states also provide an example on the national level.  \"The states are laboratories for democracy. The federal government is in gridlock,\" he said. \"We're providing models for the day when the ice breaks up on the Hill and the legislative waters flow and the country decides to confront this problem in a realistic way.\"", "Q": ["Q: Which group's attorney believes that Arizona's bill is the wrong approach?

{"article": "(The Frisky) -- There's no question that I find Don Draper sexy. If I lived in \"Mad Men\" land for a day, I would totally make out with him on his Sterling-Cooper purchased desk. In real life? Not so much. At least not anymore.  Don Draper of \"Mad Men\" is a complicated man underneath a confident exterior, columnist warns.  What makes Don Draper so drool-worthy on screen does not translate in real life. Actually, certain things do translate -- tall, dark and handsome is still tall, dark, and handsome in the real world.  But that aloof, secretive, and calculating personality that seduces his onscreen paramours and the show's viewers? Not easy to live with.  Don Draper is written as an extremely complicated and deeply flawed man who does some awful things, like cheating repeatedly on his wife, Betty, and using information he gleans from her therapist to manipulate her.  But the reasons and motivations behind his repulsive actions are slowly being revealed with each new episode. As with any TV show or movie, we itch to know what possesses someone to do the things he does, and we expect that writers as glorious as the ones behind \"Mad Men\" will eventually lead us to deep understanding of who Don Draper is and how he will evolve into a better man.  In real life, such life-changing revelations don't always come.  I dated a Don Draper-type for years. There were superficial similarities, like that they both worked in similar industries (just decades apart) and had a knack for always being \"on.\"  Guys like Don Draper are great at their jobs for a multitude of reasons, but one of them is that they present themselves as calm, collected, and unmoved by the opinions and emotions of others.  In a business situation this comes across as professional, confident, and reassuring to the client that the task at hand will be accomplished flawlessly. In a real-life romantic relationship, the refusal or inability to \"turn it off\" can be frustrating and painful for the other person involved.  At the same time, being one of the few who is able to get past the facade feels powerful. When you're in love, having that power only makes you feel even more special. The Frisky: 10 things women don't understand about men  There are reasons why Draper's wall is so high and impenetrable. Knowing those reasons -- or at least some of them -- makes viewers sympathetic to him. There's an abused boy beneath that tough exterior! A man with secrets so big, he has to hide behind a wall all of the time.  Betty Draper may not know Don's secrets, but they do share a bond he doesn't have with other people. The women he cheats with? They don't know him at all and they don't have the ability or even the interest in seeing something deeper like Betty does.  They're not threatening to his persona, but she is. These are, of course, just excuses for his bad behavior that should never fly in real life.  My ex had his own reasons for presenting a facade, for not letting anyone get too close, for acting like a jerk; some he shared, some I figured out, but all made me want to stay with him. The Frisky: Could you get past hearing \"I don't love you anymore?\"  I don't know if my Draper-esque ex cheated -- though I suspect he did -- but I do think he broke up with me because I was a threat. I saw something deeper that was fragile but wonderful, and I wanted more of it. It was enough to make me overlook the shallowness of his outward persona.  Similarly, Don Draper gives viewers plenty to love and root for, like his support of Peggy Olson, his disinterest in Pete Campbell's brown-nosing, his delivery of that Kodak pitch in the first season, and the punch he landed on Jimmy Barrett's jaw.  Like Tony Soprano before him, the behavior that would be massively unacceptable in real life is sometimes dwarfed by his acts of kindness, loyalty, and strength. The Frisky: When did you know it was over?  That's why I (and I think lots of other women) mostly love -- and sometimes hate -- Don Draper. This season -- which started August 16 -- I'm sure we'll see more cracks in Don Draper's facade, and it should be compelling and exciting to watch. But in real life, with a real Don Draper, I could only do so much.  I made as many cracks as I could, but they repaired themselves and I wasn't able to get close enough to try again. In retrospect, thank God. That's why I'll give my attention to Don Draper once a week, from the comfort of my couch, but never again in real life.

{"article": "NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- Police in India have charged 63 people with murder in the beating death of a company boss who fired them.  Labor minister Oscar Fernandes was criticized for saying Chaudhary's death was warning to management.  The 63 were among 137 people police had rounded up by Wednesday -- two days after a mob of fired employees attacked L.K. Chaudhary, the chief executive of an Italian car parts manufacturing company.  The others were charged with disturbing the peace in the Monday incident in Noida, located in the outskirts of the capital New Delhi.  More arrests are likely, said R. K. Chaturvedi, the senior superintendent of police in Noida.  The former employees of Graziano Transmissioni had gone to meet with company management over their reinstatement, said Noida police Inspector Manoj Pathak.  The meeting turned violent, and the mob attacked Chaudhary with iron rods, Pathak said.  On Tuesday, India's labor minister, Oscar Fernandes, drew sharp criticism after he said Chaudhary's death should serve as a warning to management, according to CNN's sister network in India, CNN-IBN.  \"The workers should be dealt (with) with compassion and should not be pushed so hard that they resort to whatever that had happened in Nodia\" CNN-IBN quoted Fernandes as telling reporters.  The minister later apologized, telling CNN his comments had been taken out of context. He said the murder of the boss could never be justified.  The Italian Embassy said the company had, for several months, been facing \"violent forms of protest by self-proclaimed workers' representatives.\"  \"The situation had been repeatedly brought to the attention of the competent Indian authorities, both at central and local level,\" it said in a statement.  Business groups condemned the killing with the Confederation of Indian Industry calling it \"tragic, unwanted and gory.\"  \"Such instances of industrial violence cannot be a solution to any problem and must not be tolerated,\" said Salil Singh, chairman of the group that promotes industrial growth.  Meanwhile, authorities sought to appease businesses that police were aggressively investigating the case.  \"The legal course will be followed and all culprits brought to book,\" Commerce Minister Kamal Nath said. \"This stray tragic occurrence would not be allowed to mar India's position as an investment-friendly destination.\"  CNN's Harmeet Shah Singh contributed to this report.", "Q": ["Q: What company were they fired from?

{"article": "  -- The Drug Enforcement Administration said Wednesday it's considering tighter restrictions on propofol, a drug reportedly found after Michael Jackson's death in the Holmby Hills, California, mansion he rented.  The Drug Enforcement Administration said Wednesday it's considering tighter restrictions on propofol.  \"We were petitioned and have been been looking into it for the past two years,\" said DEA spokesman Rusty Payne, who added in response to a question that the inquiry had not been affected by the singer's death of cardiac arrest on June 25.  The agency is looking at designating the sedative as a \"scheduled\" drug, which would tighten restrictions on the its distribution and use.  Payne said he could not divulge anything related to the Jackson investigation, \"but I can tell you that researchers making the decision about propofol would typically be interested in any information that would help them answer questions about the effects of propofol and its potential harm to the user.\"  Propofol, known by the trade name of Diprivan, is administered intravenously in operating rooms as a powerful anesthetic and sedative.  Payne said concern about the drug's potential for abuse led to the petition. But, he added, \"as far as we know, this is not something that's been highly abused.\"  Payne said he did not know who had sought the change, adding, \"Typically we would not make that public.\"  The process required to get a drug scheduled is a lengthy one, involving a number of agencies, he said.  \"Lots of experts weigh in on questions such as potential for abuse, pharmacological effects, history and current patterns abuse,\" he said.  Nutritionist Cherilyn Lee has said Jackson pleaded for the drug as a sleep aid, despite being told of its potentially harmful effects.  And sources close to Jackson told CNN that the insomniac singer traveled with an anesthesiologist who would \"take him down\" at night and \"bring him back up\" during a world tour in the mid-1990s.  The Associated Press and The Los Angeles Times, citing unidentified sources, have reported that police found Diprivan among Jackson's medicines.  Officials have said that the exact cause of death and whether drug use may have been involved will not be determined until after toxicology tests are completed, which could be several weeks.  On Monday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a health advisory, saying two lots of a generic version of the drug had tested positive for endotoxin, a contaminant. The drug maker, Teva Pharmaceuticals, voluntarily recalled the lots. No fatalities were reported.  A Teva spokeswoman said the DEA had contacted the drug maker \"about a specific lot number, and that lot number is not from the two we are recalling.\"  Spokeswoman Denise Bradley would not say whether the contact was related to the Jackson investigation.  A DEA spokesman said he could not comment on any ongoing investigation.  In a written statement issued this month, the American Society of Anesthesiologists said it \"unequivocally maintains that Diprivan, or its generic name propofol, is a drug meant only for use in a medical setting by professionals trained in the provision of general anesthesia.  \"Though the drug is often used for procedures requiring sedation, patients can have extremely variable responses to the drug and some patients can become completely anesthetized, including losing the ability to breathe,\" the statement continued.  \"Diprivan should never be used outside of a controlled and monitored medical setting. Use of the drug should be directly supervised by a physician trained in anesthesia and qualified to provide physiologic rescue should too much drug be given,\" the statement said.", "Q": ["Q: When did they find him A:", "Q: What drug was found in Michael Jackson's home?

{"article": "(OPRAH.com) -- He can saw himself in half, sing a selection of Broadway showtunes and swing on a flying trapeze.  Neil Patrick Harris says he'll try to make viewers feel like they're in good hands with him as Emmy host.  When Neil Patrick Harris, one of the stars of the hit CBS sitcom \"How I Met Your Mother,\" isn't dabbling in the extraordinary, well, he's probably hosting an awards show.  In the late '80s, Neil -- known as NPH to his fans -- landed the starring role on \"Doogie Howser, M.D.\" After years of child stardom and teen heartthrob status, Neil left the small screen for the stage. He became a respected Broadway actor, starring in shows like \"Rent,\" \"Cabaret\" and \"Proof,\" before returning to television.  Now, millions know Neil as Barney Stinson, the womanizing, slap-happy sidekick on \"How I Met Your Mother,\" which begins its fifth season September 21.  Like Billy Crystal and Johnny Carson before him, this man-of-many-talents is also making his mark as an awards show host. On Sunday, September 20, Neil will host the 61st Primetime Emmy Awards. He shares his thoughts on fate, finding balance and making out with his co-star.  Kari Forsee: How are you preparing for Emmy night?  Neil Patrick Harris: I'm just trying to make sure all the comedy host elements are in place. We'll have a good opening bit and a couple surprise things throughout. We want to balance respecting the show and the doling out of the awards with the sort of random things that will keep the audience's attention in other ways. So that's kind of been my job. You want to make it unique and, yet, classic. That's a tricky dynamic. Oprah.com: Planning an Emmys party? Get 4 entertaining solutions  KF: I can imagine. How often are you rehearsing?  NPH: Well, it's sort of a litany of e-mails and phone calls all day with the producers. We had a great opening short film we are going to shoot, and it would be the first thing you shot. That was going to be with Alec Baldwin, and he withdrew at the last minute. So that got scrapped, and we're off to plan D, E or F. It's sort of like now you go: \"That's fantastic, great. We've got that person,\" or \"Oh, that person didn't work. Now what do we do?\" A lot of \"now what do we do?\" questions.  KF: Now at the Tony Awards, you sang a, may I say, legendary closing number. Will you be singing at the Emmys, or is dancing more the focus?  NPH: I suspect you won't see me dancing very much. That's not my forte. But yeah, I might throw some sort of singing into it. I haven't quite decided. I sort of feel like the Emmys are so classy and glamorous and black tie, the host really needs to respect his job title. I think too much \"Look at me! Look at me!\" as the host of a show that big is counterproductive. So long as I make you feel confident that you're in good hands with me as the host, then it's my real responsibility to introduce you to a lot of other people and elements -- other presenters who are then going to talk to you or other introductions of next sections. That's my role. It's not really to be a song-and-dance man.  KF: Did you look back at past Emmy hosts for inspiration?  NPH: Very much. Steve Allen hosted the first televised awards, which was the 7th Annual Emmy Awards, in, I think, 1955, and he was great. That was sort of my inspiration for all of this. He just had such a dry wit, a commanding voice, a great presence. You knew when you were watching it that if something went wrong, you could look to him, and he would steer you through it. It was always with great dignity and a dry sense of humor, and he was sort of out there all the time. He was definitely the \"host.\" He definitely helped the show, so I like that. Johnny Carson, too, was great.  KF: Hypothetically, what would you do if your name was called for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series this year?  NPH: Oh my, I would graciously accept, try to keep my speech to a minimum, and then quickly set it backstage, because I have a lot more to do for the next couple hours.  KF: Is the award given out early on in the show?  NPH: I think it will be within the first hour. It's a nice and refreshing win-win for me, because if I do happen to win, it will be awesome-tastic, and oddly, a bit of a distraction. And if I don't win, it just provides lots of comedy fodder for the rest of the show. So I'm pretty safe either way. It's a tough category, for sure.  KF: So the day after the Emmys, a new season of \"How I Met Your Mother\" premieres. Last season's finale left us wondering if your character, Barney Stinson, will finally settle down and start dating Robin Scherbatsky.  NPH: They certainly take a stab at it. I know there will be lots of necking and making out. Lots of canoodling between Robin and I. My lips are chapped. They have strong physical chemistry, apparently.  KF: \"How I Met Your Mother\" puts a lot of stake in fate. Are you a believer in fate?  NPH: I don't know what to make of fate. I certainly don't think you can predetermine things. It feels like if you go out of your way to try to make something happen, it rarely does. But if you allow for good things to happen, they seem to. I think a lot of that is more perception, you know? A lot of people would take getting rear-ended in their car as an example of why their life continues to be one road block after another, and I think a different person can see that same fender bender and be grateful it wasn't worse. That allows them an opportunity to learn something from it -- sort of take some sort of positive elements from that. I think if you try to angle your life in those ways, then fate, destiny, karma opens itself up to you and allows for more growth. Oprah.com: How to get lucky in love and life  KF: I'm curious, how did your father meet your mother?  NPH: They were college, fraternity and sorority sweethearts. This was in Albuquerque. She was in Alpha Chi Omega. And he was in, something Pi? They did the whole, you know, he gave her his pin. She was pinned, and they were a couple. Then, they were married, and they've only been with each other. I'm very extraordinarily lucky with my parents.... We didn't have a lot of money growing up, but we were never made to feel poor. They had amazing senses of humor, senses of music and really treated us like regular people when we were kids. So I lucked out.  KF: Did your parents help you survive child stardom?  NPH: They were definitely grounding forces during years in my life that were very tumultuous. They're remarkably grounded and were not at all blinded by the light of stardom and fame. Their main concern was just my well-being and my brother's well-being during all of our crazy times, whether they be intimate or very public. They're remarkable people.

'Pacman' has a fanatical following in the Philippines which has been further enhanced by his record breaking victory as he claimed his sixth world title at a different weight by beating Cotto on Saturday night.  \"Welcome home, the world's bext boxer of all time,\" read a banner as thousands of fans greeted the 30-year-old.  Following his hard-fought victory over Puerto Rican Cotto, all the talk is of a cash-rich superfight with American Floyd Mayweather Jr. next year.  Leading promoter Bob Arum said he is ready to put the pay-per-view extravaganza at the 147-pound welterweight class, with Las Vegas the preferred venue.  Pacquiao played down the possibility as he talked to reporters on his return.  \"We are not forcing a fight with him. It is right that he is the one challenging me, because my fights score more on pay-per-view,\" he said.

{"article": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The inspector-general of the House of Representatives will investigate recent allegations of sexual misconduct among congressional pages, the Democratic and Republican leaders of the chamber announced.  The House page program came under scrutiny after the Mark Foley scandal last year.  Two pages -- usually high school juniors who serve Congress as messengers -- have been dismissed for allegedly having oral sex in public areas of their Capitol Hill dormitory.  \"It wasn't kissing and hugging -- let me put it that way,\" said Rep. Ginny Brown-Waite, R-Florida, last week. \"It did go beyond that. There were not only a young male and female involved, but there were also observers and other page participants who were, let's say, enablers.\"  To protest what they called lax oversight, Brown-Waite has resigned from the House Page Board, along with Republican Rep. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia.  Watch more on alleged page misconduct \u00bb  Brown-Waite said her resignation was meant \"to send a loud and clear message\" to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other Democratic leaders.  Pelosi, a California Democrat, and Republican Minority Leader John Boehner of Ohio issued a joint statement on the matter Wednesday.  \"We expect the inspector-general to gather the facts and recommend the appropriate and necessary corrective actions to be taken by the House,\" it said.  In 2006, Florida GOP Rep. Mark Foley was forced to resign after his sexually suggestive e-mails to male pages were made public.  The House Ethics Committee later found that some people who knew about Foley's questionable communications chose to \"remain willfully ignorant\" rather than confront the matter.  Then-House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Illinois, promised an overhaul of the program, which Pelosi pledged to pursue after Democrats gained control of the House of Representatives in the 2006 elections.  \"Apparently Democrats didn't learn from the Mark Foley incident that pages need better supervision,\" Brown-Waite said. \"Apparently they haven't learned anything.\"  No members of Congress are involved in the current controversy, and House Clerk Lorraine Miller, who administers the programs, said the students involved were dismissed.

{"article": " -- Fifteen years ago this month, Rwanda declared a cease-fire in a genocide that left more than 800,000 dead. In the attacks that started in April 1994, Hutu militias and members of the general population sought out Tutsis and moderate Hutus -- and went on a 100-day killing rampage.  In June of 1994, Rwanda was still in the grip of a 100-day killing rampage.  Civilians and children got incentives to take part in the atrocities, including promises of land belonging to their Tutsi neighbors.  It was one of the most brutal genocides in modern history. Some figures put the number of dead at 1 million, 10 percent of the population of the central African nation. Millions more were raped and disfigured. A whole generation of children lost their parents.  What started the Tutsi and Hutu rivalry  The Tutsi ethnic minority and the Hutu majority had been at odds even before 1994. The rivalry started during colonial times, when the Belgians considered Tutsis the privileged ethnicity, thus giving them better opportunities.  The Hutus were considered inferior, prompting resentment that was passed on through the generations. The first major assault on Tutsis occurred in 1959, killing thousands and prompting more attacks over the years.  The animosity caused the Tutsis to flee to neighboring countries, including Burundi and Uganda. The Hutus took over the government when Rwanda gained its independence from Belgium in 1962, but the resentment remained.  Hours before the genocide  In early April, a plane carrying then-President Juvenal Habyarimana, a Hutu, was shot down near the capital, Kigali. The president, his Burundian counterpart and their aides were killed. A few hours later, Rwanda erupted into chaos.  Some have accused current President Paul Kagame, a Tutsi, of masterminding the killing. Kagame, who led a Tutsi militia group at the time, has denied any ties. He has accused Hutu rebels of instigating the assassinations to incite fury and attacks on Tutsis.  Differences between Hutus and Tutsis  They speak the same language and practice the same customs. However, most Tutsis are considered tall and lanky, which has led to speculation that they have Ethiopian heritage. During the genocide, the bodies of Tutsis were thrown into rivers by the Hutus, who said they were sending them back to Ethiopia.  The aftermath of the genocide  After 100 days of death and destruction, the Tutsi militia led by Kagame defeated the Hutu rebels and took control of the government. Scores of Hutus fled to neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo, where they have been accused of inciting more violence. Rwanda has invaded Congo various times to launch an offensive against Hutus allegedly linked to the genocide.  After the cease-fire, a multiethnic government made up of Hutu President Pasteur Bizimungu and Vice President Kagame came into power. Bizimungu was later accused of ethnic discord and jailed. Kagame became president in 2000.  Trials for genocide suspects  Top officials such as army generals and politicians who allegedly took part in the genocide are tried in the Rwandan justice system and the International Criminal Tribunal, which is based in Tanzania. Civilians who allegedly contributed either directly or indirectly are tried in gacaca courts.  The latter are community courts conducted by a panel of nine civilians in an open field.  The courts allow survivors to point out and confront their attackers. Gacaca means \"open grass\" in the local language. Human rights organizations say the gacacas fall short on delivering justice.  State of the nation 15 years later  Rwanda is now considered one of Africa's most stable nations. Education, health care, tourism and trade -- which were destroyed in the genocide -- have improved dramatically. Kagame has made big strides against corruption, a major problem in Africa.  However, critics have accused him of being an autocratic leader who has stifled the country's media. Others have said the growth in economy is limited to urban areas and has not trickled into rural areas.", "Q": ["Q: How many died during the killing?

{"article": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- As the saying goes, \"Pain is temporary, film is forever\" and noone in the movie business knows this better than stuntmen.  Stunt double Terry Leonard performs a hazardous jump from horseback to a truck as Indiana Jones in \"Raiders of the Lost Ark.\"  Hollywood's athletes regularly defy death in pursuit of ever more extreme spectacles to keep us on the edge our cinema seats.  \"The Screening Room\" takes a look at some of the best stunts ever pulled off -- and a few that didn't end so well.  Don't agree with the list? Think we've missed one? Tell us in the SoundOff box below.  1. \"Steamboat Bill, Jr.\" (Charles Reisner, 1928) Stunt: Building falls down  Stuntman: Buster Keaton  Charlie Chaplin may be better remembered, but no early stuntman was more willing to risk eternal oblivion for a great stunt than Keaton. In perhaps his most perfect stunt, the side of a building crashes down on top of him and Keaton is saved only by an open window that fits neatly around him. The window was built to have clearance of two inches around each shoulder and on the top of his head. As Keaton himself said, \"You don't do these things twice.\"  2. \"Stagecoach\" (John Ford, 1939)   Stunt: High speed stagecoach jump  Stuntman: Yakima Canutt  Ex-rodeo cowboy Yakima Canutt was probably the first celebrity stuntman, best known as a stunt double for John Wayne. In this stunt -- which has since become a Western classic -- he portrays a galloping warrior during an Indian attack on a stagecoach. He jumps from his own horse to the six-horse team pulling the stagecoach, is shot, falls, and is dragged underneath the fast-moving team and stagecoach.  3. \"Ben Hur\" (William Wyler, 1959)  Stunt: Chariot race Stuntman: Joe Canutt  Canutt (son of Yakima) doubles for Charlton Heston in the famous chariot race. Half way through, things veer off plan and he is forced down the inside part of the track straight towards a wrecked chariot. When his charito hits, Canutt is flung over the front of the chariot, where he clings before clambering back on. The sequence was completely unplanned but made it into the film because Canutt kept a cool head even though he was injured.  4. \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" (Stephen Spielberg, 1981)   Stunt: Truck drag  Stuntman: Terry Leonard  This intense stunt sequence was so hazardous to perform that veteran stuntman Terry Leonard only agreed to do it if his friend and fellow stuntman Glenn H. Randall Jr. was driving the truck. A ditch was dug underneath the path of the truck to give Leonard enough room to manoeuver. Harrison Ford, an accomplished stuntman in his own right, performed an earlier portion of the sequence, where Indy hung onto the bonnet of the truck only by a bending hood ornament.  5. \"GoldenEye\" (Martin Campbell, 1995)   Stunt: 750 foot bungee jump  Stuntman: Wayne Michaels  This breathtaking Bond stunt was performed at the Verzasca hydro-electric dam in Switzerland and done in one take. Michaels jumped from a specially-constructed platform built to jut out from the dam to prevent him making contact with the front of the dam, which was studded with steel pegs. This, combined with his high falling velocity, could have proved fatal.  6. \"Who am I?\" (Wo shi shei) (Jackie Chan, 1998) Stunt: 21-storey slide  Stuntman: Jackie Chan  It's almost impossible to choose just one of Chan's stunts, but his faintly slapstick 21-storey slide down the side of a skyscraper is pretty impressive -- even more so when you find out he did it without a harness. He never uses stunt doubles or special effects and as a result has broken just about every bone in his body over the years. Now that's commitment.  7. \"Sharky's Machine\" (Burt Reynolds, 1981)   Stunt: Free-fall jump  Stuntman: Dar Robinson  At 220 feet, legendary stuntman Dar Robinson's jump from Atlanta's Westin Peachtree Plaza Hotel remains the highest free-fall stunt ever performed from a building for a commercially-released film. Ironically, despite it being a record-breaking fall, moviegoers only see the briefest moment of the actual stunt in the film. The rest of the fall from the skyscraper is disappointingly a dummy.  8. \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\" (George Roy Hill, 1969) Stunt: Cliff Leap  Stuntmen: Mickey Gilbert/Howard Curtis  Trapped by the Superposse, Butch and Sundance leap from the top of a cliff into the boiling waters of a river below. It's set up nicely with some humorous dialogue: \"I can't swim.\" \"Are you crazy? The fall will probably kill you!\" Robert Redford and Paul Newman did jump off the cliff, but landed on a ledge with a mattress about six feet below. The stuntmen jumped off a construction crane at a studio lot obscured by a painting of the cliffs.  9. \"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\" (James Cameron, 1991)  Stunt: Motorcycle jump  Stuntman: Peter Kent  Stuntman Peter Kent's resemblance to Arnold Schwarzenegger was the basis of a 14-year association with the ex-action hero. As Schwarzenegger's stunt double he performed the T-101's famous motorbike jump into a massive storm drain. To get the effect, his motorbike was rigged up to a web of one-inch cables, to cut the impact when the bike and rider hit the ground. The cables were later digitally erased.  10. \"Deathproof\" (Quentin Tarantino, 2007) Stunt: Car chase on bonnet  Stuntwoman: Zo\u00eb Bell  Bell won an award at the Oscars of the stunt world, the Taurus stunt awards, for this daredevil action piece. She clings precariously to the bonnet of a car going at 85 miles per hour while receiving hits from a second car in a long, climactic chase scene. Bell is a stuntwoman by trade but it's easy to see why Tarantino flouted the unspoken Hollywood convention that stuntmen stay out of the limelight and cast her as the film's lead.  And five tragic stunts that didn't come off...  Stunts are a dangerous business, and it doesn't always work out. We pay tribute to five brave stunt men and women who fell in the line of duty.  1. \"Top Gun\" (Tony Scott,1986)  Renowned aerobatic pilot Art Scholl died during the making of \"Top Gun\" in 1985 after his plane never recovered from a flat spin and plunged into the Pacific Ocean.  2. \"The Crow\" (Alex Proyas,1994)  Martial arts legend Bruce Lee's son Brandon was shot and killed during a stunt shooting sequence, when the cap of a blank accidentally penetrated his abdomen and lodged in his spine.  3. \"Twilight Zone: The Movie\" (Joe Dante/John Landis, 1983)  Actor Vic Morrow and child actors Renee Chen and My-ca Dinh Le were instantly killed when a special-effects explosion caused a helicopter to spin out of control and crash down on top of them.  4. \"Cannonball Run\" (Hal Needham, 1981)  Stuntwoman Heidi Von Beltz was paralysed from the neck down when her sports car crashed head on into a van during a stunt on the set of the film.  5. \"Armour of God\" (Jackie Chan, 1987)  Chan fell 15 feet while jumping from a wall to a tree branch. He landed hard on his head, causing part of his skull to crack and lodge in his brain. He required major surgery and now has a permanent hole in his head which is filled by a plastic plug.", "Q": ["Q: For what is Buster Keaton saved by in \"Steamboat Bill Jr\"?

{"article": "Washington (CNN) -- As the United States completes its withdrawal of all military forces from Iraq by the end of the month, Iraq's prime minister made a pitch to leaders of American commerce and industry Tuesday: Iraq is open for business.  In an address to American executives at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Washington, Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki said his country offers \"limitless\" opportunities for American companies.  Al-Maliki said his country is trying to diversify from an energy-dominated economy, to one that focuses on financial, medical, agricultural, educational and infrastructure services as well.  The end of U.S. military operations in Iraq heralds the beginning of a \"wider relationship\" between the two countries where \"not generals but businessmen\" will focus on economic and political engagement between the two countries, al-Maliki told the audience. He spoke to more than 400 executives representing a wide range of industries including petroleum, engineering and construction, commercial aviation, architecture, maritime cargo and financial services.  As U.S. investment in Iraq has increased since 2008, al-Maliki said Iraq wants to see a much greater presence of U.S. companies in his country to help spur greater spending and investment on the country's infrastructure as a way to better the lives of Iraqis and create more U.S. jobs in the process.  Total foreign direct investment in Iraq hit $70 billion for the first months of 2011, according to the chamber. The United States has increased its investment from nearly nearly $2 billion in 2010 to more than $8 billion this year, the organization said. That figure represents 11.6% of all investment entering Iraq, the chamber said.  The International Monetary Fund has projected the Iraqi economy to grow at a faster pace than China or India over the next two to three years.  Despite growing U.S. investment in Iraq, the chamber continued its own pitch to U.S. businesses of the potential Iraq represents for them, and American workers, before al-Maliki spoke.  \"We continue to trail our trading partners with respect to investment and economic engagement in Iraq,\" said Lionel Johnson, vice president for Middle East and North African Affairs at the chamber. The private sector stands to play a crucial role in filling the capacity void left in many sectors of the Iraqi economy following the U.S. military departure, Johnson said.  Winning business for American firms in Iraq has not been an easy prospect in the past. Not a single U.S. energy firm secured a deal for oil production at an auction of contracts by the Iraqi government two years ago. Many members of Congress were outraged, and questioned the U.S. investment in Iraq to that point after lucrative multi-billion-dollar contracts went to Russian and Chinese firms instead.  In the past year, the United States Business Council in Iraq was established to advance commercial interests for American firms operating in Iraq.  Opportunity aside, al-Maliki acknowledged the difficulty of moving his country from the planned economy of the Saddam Hussein era to a market-based system governed by transparency laws and international regulations, not to mention convincing American businesses to invest in a country that still experiences a high volume of violence. He assured his audience that his government was doing all it could to root out corruption and make the country safe for businesses to operate.  \"Make no mistake, this is a country that's developing, its commerce is developing, it's going to take time, it's going to take energy,\" Deputy Secretary of State Thomas Nides told CNN after al-Maliki spoke. \"U.S. companies are going there because they believe they can make money and at the end of the day that's what it is about, and most of these companies have dealt with complicated environments. Iraq is no different, but we have seen huge progress.\"  Nides said the \"robust diplomatic staff\" still based in Iraq after the military withdrawal will include large economic and legal teams to work with U.S. companies operating in Iraq.  Nearly 40 leaders from the Iraqi private sector made the trip to Washington with al-Maliki to meet with their American counterparts.", "Q": ["Q: With what organization Al-Maliki has business talks?

{"article": "Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Dennis Hopper took what may be his final bow Friday as his star was dedicated on Hollywood's Walk of Fame.  His lawyer and doctor told the judge overseeing his divorce this week that Hopper is dying of prostate cancer, but the 73-year-old actor was smiling broadly during the ceremony.  \"I just want to thank you,\" Hopper told the crowd surrounding him. \"That's all I can do.\"  \"Easy Rider\" co-star Jack Nicholson stood behind Hopper as Hollywood star number 2,403 was revealed with Hopper's name in front of the Egyptian Theater. Other stars on hand included director David Lynch and singers Johnny Mathis and Dwight Yoakam.  With his 6-year-old daughter, Galen, by his side, Hopper waved and bowed to hundreds of fans lining a barricade along Hollywood Boulevard.  Hopper's doctor called him \"extremely weak\" and said he weighs barely 100 pounds in a court document filed this week, but he walked on his own during the 45 minutes he was at the ceremony.  His forehead and right hand were bandaged, but not because of his illness. Hopper said he \"took a terrible fall\" and \"got pretty screwed up\" as photographers followed him outside his Venice, California, home Thursday.  \"I want to thank the paparazzi,\" he said. \"I know you've got a tough job, but sometimes you ought to be a little more sensitive.\"  Hopper, who is undergoing radical chemotherapy for advanced, metastasized prostate cancer, is also divorcing his wife of 14 years, Victoria Hopper.  iReporter captures the star ceremony  He is too weak and ill to be questioned by lawyers in the divorce, but attending Friday's ceremony \"is a positive experience in every way,\" his doctor's sworn statement said.  The couple separated in January when he filed for divorce, claiming the stress of their relationship was threatening his life as he battled cancer.  \"The presence of his estranged wife is hampering Mr. Hopper's present cancer care as she introduces significant additional stress into his life,\" Dr. David Argus said. \"The less Mr. Hopper has to do with his estranged wife at this time, the more likely he is to have his life extended.\"  Victoria Hopper's lawyer did not immediately respond to calls for comment.  The divorce case is set for an April 5 hearing in Los Angeles County Superior Court.  iReport: Hopper surrounded by friends, family at ceremony  Hopper said the Starz cable network paid for his Hollywood star ceremony, which cost $25,000. His last acting job was on \"Crash,\" the TV series based on the Oscar-winning movie of the same name. Hopper's acting career has spanned almost six decades. In the '50s he had roles in several TV shows and films, including \"Rebel Without a Cause\" (1955) and \"Giant\" (1956). He became a Hollywood sensation for \"Easy Rider,\" the 1969 film he directed and co-wrote in which he played a dissolute, countercultural biker.", "Q": ["Q: What does doctor recommend he appear at?

{"article": "MEXICO CITY (CNN) -- Mexican President Felipe Calderon outlined a series of economic recovery measures Wednesday, including freezing gasoline prices for the rest of the year and lowering natural gas prices by 10 percent.  Mexican President Felipe Calderon announces his economic recovery proposals on Wednesday.  Calderon also announced an ambitious agenda to help rebuild the nation's highways, bridges and other public-use facilities. The National Infrastructure Program, as he called it, will spend 570 billion pesos ($42 billion).  Petroleos Mexicanos, the nationally owned oil industry, will receive an additional 17 billion pesos ($1.2 billion).  Calderon made his wide-ranging announcement in a nationally televised speech attended by his wife, Cabinet members, governors and other public and private officials. He said Mexico is in better shape this year to fight off recession than it was in previous instances.  The recovery plan will address five areas: employment aid, family finances, competitiveness, infrastructure, and actions toward public spending that is more transparent and efficient.  In all, Calderon promised to spend billions of pesos to help Mexicans weather the global financial storm.  For example, Calderon pledged 2.6 billion pesos ($193 million) to improve a Social Security program for unemployed Mexicans, increasing from two months to six months the time they will receive medical and maternity coverage.  Other programs he announced also carried hefty price tags.  The government will spend 2.2 billion pesos ($163 million) to help Mexicans who are unemployed or underemployed, Calderon said.  The recovery measure includes financing to help poor families buy more energy-efficient electrical appliances. The government will set aside 750 million pesos ($55 million) to pay 50 percent of the costs of replacing old appliances.  To help businesses, the federal government will make at least 20 percent of its purchases from small- and medium-size companies, Calderon said.

{"article": " -- A video purporting to be from a vigilante group whose goal is the eradication of the Zetas cartel from the state of Veracruz, Mexico, has surfaced on the Internet, but its credibility remains unproven.  Five masked men dressed in black appear on the video, sitting behind a long table. The spokesman explains that they are a group called the \"Mata Zetas,\" or Zeta Killers. They describe themselves as an \"extermination\" force that works as the armed front \"of the people and for the people.\"  The speaker says that the group's only goal is to kill members of the Zetas, a ruthless cartel whose area of influence includes the eastern state of Veracruz. Members of the Mata Zetas are prohibited from committing crimes such as extortion or kidnappings, according to the video.  The video was released via YouTube days after 35 bodies were found in two trucks during rush hour in the city of Boca del Rio.  But is the video really evidence of the birth of a vigilante group in Veracruz?  In the video, the speaker does not claim responsibility for the 35 deaths.  It is also not the first time that a seemingly grassroots group emerged in Veracruz as a counterbalance to the cartels.  In 2007, a group named the \"Gente Nueva,\" or New People, made itself known through menacing notes, web-posted videos, torture and executions and quasi-patriotic rhetoric.  The group left notes next to bodies, claiming that the victims were Zetas or supporters of the Zetas. But U.S. officials with knowledge of the group said Gente Nueva was not a vigilante group but a facade for the Sinaloa cartel, which at the time was battling the Zetas and Gulf Cartel in Veracruz. The Zetas and Gulf cartel have since split into warring factions.  Mexico's attorney general's office responded with a statement saying that it would investigate the video and any group that tries to take justice into its own hands.  \"The only path to reach long-lasting security and peace is through the rule of law and strengthening of our institutions,\" the statement said.  In October of last year, another possible paramilitary group surfaced in Michoacan state. A group calling itself the \"Pelotones Omega\" distributed fliers indicating its members would fight against kidnappers, murderers and other criminals.", "Q": ["Q: is the zetas cartel from the veracruz state A:", "Q: will authoroties investigate these groups A:", "Q: Which state does the Zetas cartel operate in?

{"article": " -- A member of the group dubbed the \"Jena 6\" is facing misdemeanor assault charges after a fight at his Texas high school Wednesday, police said Thursday.  Bryant Purvis was arrested after a fight Wednesday at his Texas high school, police said.  Bryant Purvis, 19, was arrested after the incident at Hebron High School in Carrollton, Texas. Carrollton police Sgt. John Singleton told CNN the altercation does not appear to be racially motivated.  School officials contacted police about the fight Wednesday morning. An 18-year-old student told authorities two males approached him and asked if he had flattened the tires of \"their homeboy's\" car, according to an affidavit supporting the arrest warrant.  The student said he didn't, but the two told him they didn't believe him and walked away.  Purvis, he said, approached him from behind immediately afterward, then grabbed him with one hand and began to choke him.  \"Purvis continued to choke [the student] and told him, 'Don't you ever mess with my car again,'\" the affidavit said. \"Purvis then pushed his head into the seating area of the bench,\" causing the student to strike his left eye, then walked away.  The affidavit said that in a written statement, Purvis wrote, \"I walked over to him and grabbed him by his neck, then told him not to mess with my car anymore, then I left.\"  Police reported the student had marks on his neck and bruising on his eye.  A municipal judge set Purvis' bond at $1,000, and he was transferred to the Denton County Detention Facility, Singleton said.  Purvis is one of six former students in Jena, Louisiana, accused of being involved in the beating of a white student. He initially was charged with second-degree attempted murder and conspiracy, but charges against him were reduced in November to second-degree aggravated battery. He is awaiting trial in that case.  Civil rights leaders Martin Luther King III and Al Sharpton led more than 15,000 marchers to Jena -- a town of about 3,000 -- in September to protest how authorities handled the cases against Purvis and the five others accused in the December 2006 beating of fellow student Justin Barker.  After his arraignment in November, Purvis told reporters he had moved to another town to complete high school.

{"article": "Washington (CNN) -- The United States has committed an additional million dollars to fight child trafficking in Haiti in the wake of last month's earthquake, U.S. officials said Wednesday.  Word of the action came as Secretary of State Hillary Clinton chaired the Obama administration's first meeting of the President's Interagency Task Force to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons.  Clinton, speaking in the meeting, called trafficking in people \"one of the most important human rights issues we deal with.\" Yearly meetings of the task force were mandated by the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, passed 10 years ago.  Before the earthquake, the United States provided $500,000 for programs to protect children in Haiti from trafficking. The additional million is being shifted from other programs, officials said.  In a briefing at the State Department, Ambassador Louis CdeBaca of the department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons told reporters that traffickers take advantage of vulnerabilities resulting from race, class, migratory status and displacement from natural disasters.  On Haiti, he said, \"we are hearing anecdotal evidence from UNICEF\" about trafficking of children but there are no firm figures on it.  \"We are hearing about men coming into the camps offering food and water to girls to come with them in trucks,\" he said, adding that \"we don't have hard evidence\" on this.  Before the earthquake, he said, there were 300,000 \"restaveks,\" children given up by their families for domestic servitude, in Haiti. Another 3,000 were estimated to have been taken to the Dominican Republic.  He added that according to estimates by the International Labour Organization, 12.3 million people worldwide are \"laboring in bondage.\" Other estimates, he said, put that number at 27 million, although there is no independent confirmation.  More than half of them, as much as 60 percent, are females, he said. Nine million to 10 million are forced laborers, and 2 million to 3 million are in sexual slavery, he added.", "Q": ["Q: How much did the US  provide? A:", "Q: How much money did the US provide?

{"article": " -- Iggy Pop invented punk rock. That's how cool he is. His songs have been covered by the likes of Guns N' Roses, REM, The Red Hot Chili Peppers and The Sex Pistols.  Iggy Pop: The wildest man in rock music.  He is the wildest wild man of rock and his four-decade career has been marked by drug addiction, self mutilation and onstage nudity -- and at 61 years old he is showing no signs of growing old gracefully.  Born on April 21, 1947, in Muskegon, Michigan, James Newell Osterberg grew up in a trailer park.  When he began learning the drums as a teenager his parents gave up their bedroom to house his drum kit. It wasn't long before he took his talent out of the bedroom, playing with high-school band The Iguanas, from which he later took his stage name.  After graduating from high school in 1965, Iggy formed a blues band called the Prime Movers. Following a brief stint at the University of Michigan he moved to Chicago, playing drums with local bluesmen, before returning to Michigan with his sights set on fronting a rock band.  Watch Iggy Pop show CNN around Miami \u00bb  In 1967, he recruited guitarist Ron Asheton, his drummer brother Scott Asheton and bassist Dave Alexander and formed The Psychedelic Stooges.  It was after seeing the Doors in concert, and inspired by Jim Morrison's confrontational stage persona, that James Osterberg reinvented himself as Iggy Pop, a drug-fueled, crazed whirling dervish of a front man, who would strut semi-naked around the stage, roll around in broken glass and dive headlong into the audience.  The band shortened its name to The Stooges and released its eponymous debut in 1969. Right from the start there was clearly something different about Iggy Pop. At the height of flower power, when The Stooges' contemporaries were singing about peace and love, Iggy was singing \"No Fun\" and \"I Wanna Be Your Dog.\"  See photos of Iggy in action. \u00bb  The album was a brilliant mess of raw, blues-influenced garage rock, but it sold poorly, as did the 1970 follow up \"Fun House,\" later described by Jack White of the White Stripes as \"the definitive rock album of America.\" Watch Iggy Pop show CNN around Miami  By this time, Iggy had begun the Heroin use that would plague his career and in 1971, The Stooges split up after being dropped by their record label. That same year, Iggy met David Bowie, who took him to England, re-united The Stooges and produced 1973's \"Raw Power.\"  With \"Raw Power,\" Iggy and the Stooges created the blueprint for punk rock and made an album that would one day be regarded as a landmark in rock music, an album that Nirvana singer Kurt Cobain listed as his favorite of all time. Nonetheless, it was another commercial failure and in 1974, The Stooges split again.  By this time, Heroin had taken over Iggy's life and in 1975 he checked himself into a Los Angeles mental institution in an effort to kick the habit. Bowie visited him there and took Iggy along on his 1976 tour, before the pair moved to West Berlin in an effort to get away from the temptation of drugs.  It was there that Bowie produced and co-wrote Iggy's 1977 solo albums, \"The Idiot\" and \"Lust for Life.\" The latter included the songs \"The Passenger\" and \"Lust for Life,\" which have since become staples of TV ads and movie soundtracks, spawning countless cover versions.  More commercial than The Stooges' records, Iggy's solo albums were met with critical acclaim and better sales, but never breakthrough into the mainstream. Songs that Bowie wrote with Iggy during this period were later included on Bowie albums, with \"China Girl\" becoming a hit single for Bowie.  Iggy carried on touring and releasing albums throughout the 80s, without much commercial success, although the single \"Real Wild Child\" was a hit in the U.S. and UK. But by the end of the decade, Iggy was beginning to be recognized as \"the Godfather of Punk,\" with a new generation of bands citing him as an influence.  Members of Guns N' Roses and the B52s appeared on his 1990 album \"Brick by Brick,\" which sold more than 500,000 copies, and his 2003 album \"Skull Ring\" featured the likes of Green Day, Sum 41 and Peaches. But what really made \"Skull Ring\" special was that it re-united Iggy with Ron and Scott Asheton of The Stooges.  After years on the periphery, Iggy was suddenly fashionable, with the reformed Stooges appearing at festivals all over the world. The band recorded the album \"The Weirdness\" in 2007, but it was their astonishingly powerful live performances that showed why they were still such a big deal 40 years after they started out.  Any hopes Iggy may have had for a peaceful retirement in Miami have been dashed. At 61 years old he is still performing with the same energy and abandon as when The Stooges first formed, with only marginally less stage diving and nudity. It seems that the world has finally caught up with Iggy Pop, the most exciting, unpredictable and entertaining man in rock.", "Q": ["Q: What happened in 1975?

{"article": " -- Scabby the Rat may not have a word to say, but the large rodent-shaped balloon helped a labor union earn a free-speech victory Thursday before New Jersey's highest court.  Big Sky Balloons, based in Chicago, Illinois, rents out \"union rats\" like Scabby and other inflatables.  The seven justices ruled unanimously that the local union had a right to display its 10-foot-tall, black, rat-shaped balloon at a rally held outside a fitness center.  At issue was whether a township could enforce a ban on inflatable or portable signs and banners on public property. Lawrence Township police had levied a $100 fine against an official from the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers because of Scabby.  The court concluded that while townships have a right to maintain an \"aesthetic environment\" and ensure public safety, its restrictions on expressive displays \"do not justify a content-based restriction of non-commercial speech.\"  \"There is no evidence to suggest that a rat balloon is significantly more harmful to aesthetics or safety than a similar item being displayed as an advertisement or commercial logo,\" wrote Justice John Wallace Jr.  The balloon and others like it, nicknamed Scabby by the Chicago-based company that made them, have been used by labor unions as street theater since 1990 to protest anti-union activities.  IBEW members were marching on the sidewalk outside Gold's Gym in Lawrence Township in April 2005 in response to a dispute with a contractor working at the business.  A police officer had ordered the balloon deflated, but returned an hour later to find it blown back up. The labor official in charge admitted he ordered the rat reinflated, and he was given a summons.  Lower state courts had ruled the township's ordinance was content-neutral and did not suppress the union's ability to spread its message, since members still could chant and distribute handbills to the public.  About 200 Scabby balloons are used by labor unions nationwide, according to Big Sky Balloons. They come in three colors, each showing pink eyes, front claws extended, and two big front incisors.", "Q": ["Q: Where are the union rallies? A:", "Q: What did the township ban?

{"article": " --   Known for building skate parks and shaping the skateboarding scene in New York, Andy Kessler, 48, died this week after an allergic reaction to an insect sting, friends and family told news media.  Andy Kessler, seen in 2005, reportedly died this week after suffering an allergic reaction to an insect sting.  Kessler's death is a reminder that stings can be deadly for those with an allergy to certain insects, the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology said Friday.  At least 40 people in the United States die each year as the result of insect stings, the academy said. As many as 5 percent of Americans are at risk for a severe, potentially life-threatening allergic reaction from insect stings, according to the organization.  In a typical week in the emergency room, doctors at Emory University Hospital Midtown in Atlanta, Georgia, see about six or fewer cases of people with allergic reactions to insects, said Dr. James P. Capes, director of the emergency department.  \"It's common, but not incredibly common,\" he said.  Typically, when stung by an insect, a person will have no reaction or a mild local reaction, such as redness, swelling or itching at the site of the sting. However, some people experience a more widespread reaction, such as a drop in blood pressure, lightheadedness or hives all over. iReport.com: Send us your allergy stories  In the most serious cases, a person can go into anaphylaxis, a condition in which he or she may have difficulty breathing. Other symptoms include swelling of the mouth or throat, itchy skin, wheezing, cough and localized pain, said Dr. Clifford Bassett, medical director of Allergy and Asthma Care of New York.  Capes advises people who experience a systemic reaction to call 911 and wait for an ambulance, because it will have medicine to treat the reaction immediately. An antihistamine such as Benadryl will be given and, in severe cases, a shot of epinephrine.  Even if the reaction is not severe, Benadryl will help with normal symptoms of insect stings, Capes said.  Those who have had allergic reactions to insects should always carry an antihistamine and an epinephrine auto-injector for emergencies, experts said.  Insect allergies may be harder to control than some food allergies because it's not always possible to predict when bees, wasps and other stinging bugs are around, Capes said.  Severe reactions don't usually happen the very first time a person gets stung, Capes said.  \"The thing about allergic reactions that is interesting, or scary, is that we never know what the next allergic reaction is going to be,\" he said.  For those who have a history of anaphylactic reactions to insects, vaccines are available for yellow jackets, wasps, honey bees and fire ants, Bassett said. The immunization process takes three to five years, he said.  There are also blood and skin tests that people can take to determine whether they are sensitive to these insects, he said.  Besides anaphylaxis, people may experience other kinds of reactions, Bassett said. If a person is stung hundreds of times at once, he or she may need emergency care, as the venom may lead to seizures, shock and even death, he said.  There is also a rare reaction called serum sickness that includes joint pain and flu-like illness that may result from insect stings, and has allergy-like symptoms, Bassett said.  In rare cases, even mosquito bites can lead to anaphylaxis, Bassett said. There is no treatment for mosquito allergies, but there is a diagnostic test, he said.  Bassett offers the following tips to reduce the danger of insects:  \u2022 Stay away from stinging insect nests when possible.  \u2022 Consider wearing closed-toed shoes in an area where there may be many stinging insects.  \u2022 Remain calm and quiet around a stinging insect, and move slowly away from it.  \u2022 Avoid brightly colored clothing, as well as perfumes and scented hair products and lotions.  \u2022 Avoid loose-fitting clothing, which can accidentally trap the insect.  \u2022 Use caution when eating outdoors, especially when sodas or other sweetened drinks are available.

{"article": "LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- California's director of adult prisons is recommending against \"compassionate release\" for a terminally ill former Manson family member, a spokeswoman said.  Susan Atkins is led from a Los Angeles grand jury room after her indictment in the 1969 \"Manson murders.\"  Suzan Hubbard, director of the Division of Adult Institutions, decided that Susan Atkins' request should not be sent to the sentencing court for consideration, said Terry Thornton, spokeswoman for the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.  Hubbard's recommendation is advisory and will not necessarily prevent Atkins' release.  The court -- not the department or the state Board of Parole Hearings -- has the final say on whether Atkins should be released, Thornton said. \"They're the only ones legally who can recall the sentence,\"  she added.  Atkins, 60, was convicted in the 1969 slayings of actress Sharon Tate and four others. She had been incarcerated at the California Institution for Women in Corona, California, but has been hospitalized since mid-March.  Her request is now before the Board of Parole Hearings, which is conducting an independent investigation and will hear the case during its monthly public meeting, Thornton said. The next meeting is scheduled July 15.  Atkins had been held for years at the Corona prison, which earlier determined that she met the criteria for compassionate release under the law, and sent her request to the corrections department.  The Board of Parole Hearings will receive public comment, discuss the request in closed session and then announce its recommendation. The board also can decide whether to refer the request to the sentencing court.  The court, based in Los Angeles, can either grant or deny Atkins' request. It also can recall her life sentence and resentence Atkins to a lesser term, allowing for her to be paroled.  In 2007, the department received 60 compassionate release requests, Thornton said. Ten were approved.  Citing privacy rules, prison officials would not disclose the nature of Atkins' illness. Her husband and attorney, James Whitehouse, has been quoted as saying she has terminal brain cancer, according to a blog called Manson Family Today. She also has had a leg amputated, the Los Angeles Times has reported.  Atkins, known within the Manson family as \"Sadie Mae Glutz,\" has been in prison since 1971 and has been denied parole 11 times. She is California's longest-serving female inmate.  Tate and three houseguests were slain in August 1969 by killers who burst into her Benedict Canyon home. A teenager who was visiting the home's caretaker in his cottage on the property also was killed.  According to historical accounts of the murders, Atkins stabbed Tate, who was 8\u00bd months pregnant, and wrote the word \"pig\" in blood on the door of the home the actress shared with her husband, director Roman Polanski.  The following night, Leno and Rosemary LaBianca were slain in their home in the Los Feliz neighborhood of Los Angeles. The two-day crime spree sent shock waves throughout Los Angeles.  All of the killers remain behind bars. Atkins also was convicted in the earlier murder of music teacher Gary Hinman.  Atkins, like family leader Charles Manson, received a death sentence. Her punishment was changed to life in prison when the California Supreme Court ruled the state's death penalty unconstitutional in 1972.  Atkins is a born-again Christian, according to a Web site maintained by her husband. During her incarceration, the site says, Atkins has worked to help at-risk youth, victims of violent crimes and homeless children.  Last month, authorities dug for buried bodies at the Inyo County, California, ranch where Manson and his followers once lived, after police became aware that testing had indicated humans might be buried there.

{"article": "ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Nearly two months ago, President Obama embarked on a two-day, two-city charm offensive in Turkey, a predominantly Muslim country and NATO military ally whose people give the United States abysmal approval ratings.  President Obama listens at a town hall-style meeting in Istanbul, Turkey, in April.  The American president toured a mosque, laid a wreath at the grave of the founder of the Turkish republic, and announced before the Turkish parliament that \"the United States is not and will never be at war with Islam.\"  Did Obama's new brand of diplomacy work?  Could 48 hours of handshakes, speeches and smiles turn around Turkish public opinion? After all, in 2007, only 9 percent of Turks polled by the Pew Research Center held favorable views of America, the lowest level among 47 countries surveyed.  If 24-year old Ece Basaran is any indicator, Obama succeeded beyond expectations.  After attending a town hall-style meeting with the American president during his visit to Istanbul last April, Basaran and a group of her friends started up a Turkish-American friendship club at her university.  \"I get positive feedback because everybody around me likes Obama,\" Basaran said, while taking a break from preparing for final exams at Istanbul's Bahcesehir University this week. Basaran said that as recently as last year, the United States was unpopular among fellow students and friends, but added that \"after Obama, it seems popular. At least the negative image began to fade away.\"  Officials and commentators in both Turkey and the United States are also calling Obama's first presidential visit to a Muslim country a positive step.  \"At the moment, he's doing the right thing,\" said Suat Kiniklioglu, a member of the Turkish parliament. \"His first task was to remedy the situation of America wielding a big stick for the last eight years.\"  \"President Obama's visit and recent policy initiatives have managed to dispel some of the pervasive suspicion in U.S.-Turkish relations -- no small achievement,\" said Ian Lesser of the German Marshall Fund, testifying before the House Foreign Affairs Committee last month. But, he added, \"much remains to be done.\"  There are strong indications that words alone will not be enough to transform years of deep suspicion many Turks feel towards the United States, particularly after the long, widely unpopular war in neighboring Iraq.  According to a recent poll published by academics at Bahcesehir University, 43 percent of Turks said they would not like to live next door to American neighbors.  In a phone interview this week, Osman Solmaz, another of the Turkish students chosen to attend the town hall meeting with Obama, said that in his hometown, the southeastern Turkish city of Diyarbakir, \"the majority of the people have prejudice against the United States.\"  \"Nobody agrees with America's foreign policy,\" said Sertac Yakin, a university student from Ankara who also attended the Istanbul meeting in April.  \"To change public opinion in Turkey is a long-term affair,\" argued Kemal Koprulu, the founder of Ari Movement, an Istanbul-based nongovernmental organization that focuses on promoting youth participation in civil society. \"There is no way that the election of a president and several nice statements from a State Department spokesman will change dramatically the public opinion in Turkey.\"  Koprulu argued that his organization has documented alarmingly high levels of anti-Americanism and anti-Westernism among young Turks. He pointed out that at a recent academic conference at one of Turkey's most progressive universities in Istanbul, he witnessed audience members give a five-minute standing ovation to a Turkish speaker who \"slammed America\" in front of a panel of visiting U.S. officials.  The White House does appear to have made some progress in patching up damaged relations with the powerful Turkish military.  Top Turkish army generals did not attend an important bilateral conference in the United States last year, following American criticism of Turkey's cross-border military offensive against Kurdish PKK rebels in Northern Iraq. This year, the Turkish military chief of staff was among the key speakers attending the conference. But Gen. Ilker Basbug reportedly told the audience of dignitaries in Washington this week that the ongoing presence of PKK rebels in Northern Iraq continues to have a negative impact on Turkish-U.S. relations.  Many Turks say they are still waiting to see to whether the Obama White House's change in tone will translate to a change in the U.S. government's deeply unpopular foreign policy in the Middle East. They highlighted America's strong support for Israel over the Palestinians, and the ongoing conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.  \"I believe [Obama] understands the importance of the Islamic world,\" said Abdurrahman Dilipak, a columnist at Vakit, Turkey's most conservative newspaper. \"We will monitor his stance. He makes promises yet we have to see how he will act. Muslims are still treated as terrorists when they arrive in the U.S.\"  That wait-and-see attitude was even reflected by Basaran, the enthusiastically pro-American student who helped found a Turkish-American friendship club at her university.  \"Because Obama has the [Muslim] name Hussein, people really love it,\" Basaran said. \"I think he's the most favorite U.S. president among Muslim people. But we'll see.\"  Yesim Borg in Istanbul contributed to this report.", "Q": ["Q: What says only 9 percent of Turks had positive view of U.S. in 2007 ?

Obama and his campaign going back six months that I've had pulled,\" he said, speaking to CNN contributor Roland Martin on WVON-AM's \"The Roland S. Martin Show\" based in Chicago, Illinois.  At a campaign rally Monday in Reno, Nevada, Obama said he is \"concerned about the tenor the campaign has taken in the last couple days.\"  \"I think that I may disagree with Sen. Clinton or Sen. Edwards on how to get things done, but we share the same goals. We're all democrats, we all believe in civil rights, we all believe in equal rights,\" said Obama.  \"I think they're good people, they are patriots and they are running because they think they can lead this country to a better place and I don't want the campaign in this stage to degenerate into so much tit-for-tat back-and-forth that we lose sight of why all of us are doing this.\"  Obama also warned his supporters to play fair.  \"If I hear my own supporters engaging in talk that I think is ungenerous or misleading or in some way is unfair then I will speak out forcefully against them and I hope the other campaigns take the same approach,\" he said.  A recording of comments Sunday by Black Entertainment Television founder Bob Johnson that appeared to criticize Obama's admitted past drug use were played on Martin's show.  Johnson later said he was referring to Obama's community organizing efforts.  \"When you listen to that tone and the inflection, he was not talking about community organizing. It seemed to be very clear what he was implying,\" Martin said.  The former president said Johnson needs to be \"taken at his word,\" adding that \"nobody knew\" what he would say and \"it wasn't part of any planned strategy.\"  Watch Martin's take on the interview \u00bb  \"This, to me, is another example of [the Obama campaign] wanting a double standard,\" he said.  Watch the latest on the war of words \u00bb  Clinton went on to say comments from Obama's campaign in the aftermath of former Pakistan Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's assassination were \"a lot worse\" than what Johnson said.  Obama's campaign implied that some of Hillary Clinton's foreign policy decisions helped exacerbate problems in Pakistan.  The ex-president called the attack \"appalling\" and said his wife did not try to turn it into a larger issue, but instead \"said 'I disagree' and moved on.\"  Hillary Clinton did respond then, saying she regretted that Obama's campaign \"would be politicizing this tragedy, and especially at a time when we do need to figure out a way forward.\"  Johnson, a Hillary Clinton supporter, made his remarks Sunday at Columbia College in South Carolina, a state with a large share of African-American voters that holds its Democratic primary on January 26.  Hillary Clinton also has accused Obama's campaign of distorting recent remarks by her and her husband that have touched off concerns among some African-American voters.  Johnson said he has held fund-raisers for Obama but was unhappy with criticisms of the former first lady by Obama's campaign.  \"As an African-American, I'm frankly insulted that the Obama campaign would imply that we are so stupid that we would think Bill and Hillary Clinton, who have been deeply and emotionally involved in black issues when Barack Obama was doing something in the neighborhood that -- I won't say what he was doing, but he said it in his book,\" Johnson said while campaigning at the largely black Northminster Presbyterian Church in Columbia, South Carolina.  In Obama's recently reprinted 1995 book, \"Dreams from My Father,\" the future presidential candidate writes he was once headed in the direction of a \"junkie\" and a \"pothead.\"  In December, Clinton personally apologized to Obama after her New Hampshire campaign co-chairman raised the issue. The adviser resigned amid the controversy that followed.  Johnson later Sunday said his remarks referred \"to Barack Obama's time spent as a community organizer, and nothing else. Any other suggestion is simply irresponsible and incorrect.\"  The Clinton and Obama camps are locked in an increasingly heated battle for black voters in South Carolina.  Watch what race has to do with the Democratic nomination \u00bb  Former South Carolina state Rep. \"I.S.\" Leevy Johnson, an Obama supporter, called on Hillary Clinton to disavow Johnson's remarks.  \"It's offensive that Sen. Clinton literally stood by and said nothing as another one of her campaign's top supporters launched a personal, divisive attack on Barack Obama,\" he said in a statement released by Obama's campaign. \"For someone who decries the politics of personal destruction, she should've immediately denounced these attacks on the spot.\"  Sunday's flare-up capped a weekend of sparring between the two camps that began with Clinton's comments last week that while the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. led the civil rights movement, \"Dr. King's dream began to be realized when President Lyndon Johnson passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It took a president to get it done.\"  Watch what Clinton says about Obama, King and the civil rights movement \u00bb  Some African-American leaders criticized the remarks as dismissive of the civil rights movement and of King, who was assassinated in 1968. On Sunday, Obama described Clinton's comments as \"ill-advised\" but rejected any suggestion that his campaign has been behind the complaints.  \"For them to somehow suggest that we're interjecting race as a consequence of a statement she made, that we haven't commented on, is pretty hard to figure out,\" he said.  And the third leading Democrat, former Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina, said Clinton was suggesting \"that real change... came not through the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King but through a Washington politician.\" Edwards won the South Carolina primary in 2004.  Speaking Sunday on NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" Clinton said Obama's backers were distorting her remarks and called King \"one of the people I admire most in the world.\"  And Sunday, at the Presbyterian church, Clinton said it was \"historic\" that both a black man and a woman were serious contenders for the White House.  \"I am so proud of my party. I am so proud of my country, and I am so proud of Sen. Barack Obama because together we have presented our cases to the people,\" she said.  Obama also accused her of \"rewriting\" history in her complaints about his voting record on Iraq.  Former President Clinton last week criticized Obama's statements over the years about Iraq, arguing the senator has not been consistent.  Obama has said his positions are consistent and that he has always staunchly opposed the war. \"She started her campaign saying she wanted to make history and has been spending a lot of time rewriting it,\" he said Sunday.

{"article": "(Entertainment Weekly) -- Dan Brown's \"The Da Vinci Code\" has spawned a raft of imitators, most of which pale in comparison; the latest, \"The Lost Symbol,\" is by Brown himself.  Dan Brown's \"The Lost Symbol\" is his first novel since the blockbuster \"The Da Vinci Code\" in 2003.  Once again, Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon is summoned to the scene of a gruesome attack, joins forces with an attractive and erudite love interest, and speeds around a world capital chasing clues, solving puzzles, and risking his life while dropping cocktail parties' worth of scholarly minutiae. Even the setting, though new, will be familiar to most readers: Washington, D.C.  This time, Langdon is lured to the Capitol to save his mentor, Peter Solomon, a prominent member of the Freemasons who's been kidnapped by a cryptic, heavily tattooed, Homer-reading psycho calling himself Mal'akh -- a vicious fellow even less plausible than the albino monk in \"The Da Vinci Code.\"  Our hero is also in possession of an ancient Masonic artifact whose clues lead him on a treasure hunt to various D.C. tourist spots as he searches for a secret long hidden by the brotherhood.  Watch the frenzy surrounding \"The Lost Symbol\" \u00bb  That secret, of course, is one giant MacGuffin -- though Brown is the rare thriller writer who seems to lavish as much attention on the object that sets his plot in motion as he does on the action itself.  But for thriller fans, it's the chase that really matters. Especially since the secrets of Freemasonry just aren't as compelling as, say, a controversial theory about Mary Magdalene and Jesus.  Luckily, Langdon remains a terrific hero, a bookish intellectual who's cool in a crisis and quick on his feet, like Ken Jennings with a shot of adrenaline. The codes are intriguing, the settings present often-seen locales in a fresh light, and Brown mostly manages to keep the pages turning -- except when one of his know-it-all characters decides to brake the action for another superfluous, if occasionally interesting, historical digression. (Did you know there's a carving of Darth Vader on the National Cathedral?)  Even after the book's climactic showdown, you must slog through another 50-plus pages of exposition that Brown couldn't cram into the main narrative. Sometimes it seems that authors, like their villains, don't know when to leave well enough alone.

{"article": " -- A tour bus carrying about 40 people rolled over Tuesday near Campbellton, Texas, killing two people and injuring more than a dozen, an official said.  Tommy Cavazos, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Public Safety, said that 18 people were injured in the Americanos tour bus crash on Interstate 37, about 50 miles south of San Antonio in southern Texas.  Most of the injured are being transported to San Antonio's Brooke Army Medical Center and University Hospital, Cavazos said.  The bus, which was headed to Matamoros, Mexico, flipped and landed on its right side, he said.  A spokesman for Brooke Army Medical Center, Dewey Mitchell, said four patients were taken to the hospital's trauma unit. He did not provide further information.  University Health System spokeswoman Julie Wiley said five adults -- four men and one woman -- were transported to the medical facility.  She could not describe their conditions but characterized the people as all between the age of 40 and 60.  Although it was not immediately clear whether others were taken elsewhere, Wiley said that University Health System and Brooke Army Medical Center are the two trauma centers in San Antonio and would receive patients in situations such as Tuesday's crash.  The names of those killed were not released.  Americanos is a subsidiary of Greyhound.  Maureen Richmond, a spokeswoman for Greyhound, said that 40 people were on board the bus, which left San Antonio shortly before 9 a.m. for Matamoros, Mexico.

{"article": "JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (CNN) -- A mother whose daughter and granddaughter attend Oprah Winfrey's school in South Africa considers the talk-show host heaven-sent, despite allegations of abuse being investigated there.  Oprah Winfrey cuts the ribbon at the opening in January of her Leadership Academy in South Africa.  \"Oprah is an angel, she is God-sent,\" Masechaba Hine said Wednesday from her small home in gritty Soweto township. \"She came to my rescue when my husband was not working.\"  Hine's daughter Palesa and her granddaughter Alebohang, both 14, were among the 152 students chosen to be the first class to attend the high-tech, high-profile Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy for Girls when it opened in January. Her faith remains unshaken by the news that South African police have opened a criminal investigation into allegations that a dorm parent mistreated students at the school.  Hine said her children \"have no problems about the school, they are happy about everything.\"  Investigators declined to provide details of the alleged abuse, but the academy's CEO, John Samuel, said in a statement issued earlier this month that an internal inquiry was launched based on a claim of misconduct involving a dormitory parent.  Watch why school is being investigated \u00bb  According to an article in The Cape Argus, a Cape Town newspaper, the dorm parent allegedly grabbed a pupil by the throat and threw her against a wall, the girl claimed. Girls at the school also claimed that the matron swore and screamed at the girls and assaulted them, the newspaper reported Saturday.  The newspaper said one of the pupils ran away from the school, blaming the alleged abuse.  Winfrey personally selected the school's students, all of them straight-A students from underprivileged backgrounds. The students get free tuition, free uniforms, free accommodation and free meals at the school in Henley-on-Klip, near Johannesburg.  In Hine's case, her children's status as the \"poorest of the poor\" that the school aims to serve was clear-cut: Hine supports the five people who live in her small two-bedroom Soweto home on the $50 a week she makes from a fruit and vegetable stand. Hine also is caring for two other orphans -- a niece and a younger granddaughter -- as well as Palesa and Alebohang, whom Hine took responsibility for when her own mother died of AIDS.  Along with the money she scrapes together, the family survives on food baskets they receive once a month from a charity.  Hine attended an emergency meeting with Winfrey when the talk-show host came to the school two weeks ago.  \"She was emotional, she was crying when she was talking about her daughters. It is not our daughters anymore, it is Oprah's daughters,\" Hine said.  Winfrey did not give the parents details of the allegations other than to say that the dormitory parent \"didn't treat the girls the way she likes,\" Hine said. She said parents were told at the start of the meeting that Winfrey \"does not want the thing to be in the media. It was a private meeting.\"  The controversy that now surrounds the school now offers a sharp contrast to the glitter and air of limitless hope when Winfrey brought a gaggle of Hollywood stars with her to officially open the well-appointed school. The criminal probe was opened after a team of three American experts hired by Winfrey gave police the results of their initial investigation, police said.  \"We came to the conclusion that there were criminal elements and then we opened the case for investigation,\" said Police Superintendent Lungelo Dlamini.  Dlamini told CNN that the team of U.S. experts hired by Winfrey to conduct the internal investigation included Robert Farley, a retired Cook County, Illinois, detective. He said two American social workers were also on the team.  Previously, Winfrey -- who has spoken publicly about the abuse she suffered as a child -- issued a statement on October 17 saying, \"Nothing is more serious or devastating to me than an allegation of misconduct by an adult against any girl at the academy.\"  In the statement, Samuel said South African child protection services were notified and the dorm parent was removed from the campus.  \"We have engaged professional investigators of the highest standing from South Africa and the United States to conduct a fair and impartial inquiry into these claims,\" the statement said.  The school's head has agreed to take a paid leave of absence pending the results of the investigation, although she is not the subject of the allegation, Samuel said.  The national prosecuting authority is deciding whether criminal charges will be filed. In an October 23 statement, Samuel referred inquiries to the South African Child Protection Services Unit.

{"article": "NEW YORK (CNN)  -- A top Baha'i official has criticized Iran's claim that the six imprisoned leaders of the religious minority were held for security reasons and not because of their faith.  President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's government has been accused of trying to eliminate the Baha'i community.  Bani Dugal, the principal representative of the Baha'i International Community to the United Nations, called Iran's assertion \"utterly baseless.\"  \"The allegations are not new, and the Iranian government knows well that they are untrue,\" Dugal said on Wednesday, quoted in a news release issued by the Baha'i movement.  \"The documented plan of the Iranian government has always been to destroy the Baha'i community, and these latest arrests represent an intensification of this plan.\"  Iranian government spokesman Gholam-Hossein Elham said the people were detained for \"security issues\" and not their faith, Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency said.  Elham said on Tuesday that the Baha'is were members of a group working together \"against national interest.\"  \"The group is an organized establishment linked to foreigners, the Zionists in particular,\" he said.  The arrests of the six last week and another Baha'i leader in March sparked sharp condemnation by the Baha'is, the United States, Canada, the European Union and humanitarian groups.  The Baha'is say the latest arrests are part of a pattern of religious persecution since 1979, when the monarchy of the Shah of Iran was toppled and an Islamic republic was created in the predominantly Shiite nation.  The Baha'is say they have been killed, jailed and \"otherwise oppressed\" only because of their religion.  \"The best proof of this is the fact that, time and again, Baha'is have been offered their freedom if they recant their Baha'i beliefs and convert to Islam, an option few have taken,\" Dugal said.  Dugal said Iran's practice of connecting the group to Zionism, the underlying political philosophy of the Jewish state, was a \"distortion\" and an attempt to \"stir animosity\" among the Iranian public.  The Baha'i World Center, which the movement refers to as its \"spiritual and administrative heart,\" is in the Acre/Haifa area in northern Israel -- a location that predates the founding of the state of Israel since it was formed during the Ottoman Empire's rule of Palestine.  The Baha'is explain that their founder, Baha'u'llah, \"after a series of successive banishments from his native Persia, was exiled, with members of his family and a small band of his followers, to the Turkish penal colony of Acre in 1868.\"  Dugal said the Iranian actions were the \"most recent iteration in a long history of attempts to foment hatred by casting the Baha'is as agents of foreign powers, whether of Russia, the United Kingdom, or the United States and now Israel all of which are completely baseless.\"  Dugal said the government's philosophies are based largely on the idea that there can be \"no prophet following Mohammed\" and that the faith \"poses a theological challenge to this belief.\"  They say Baha'u'llah is regarded by Baha'is as \"the most recent in the line of Messengers of God that stretches back beyond recorded time and that includes Abraham, Moses, Buddha, Krishna, Zoroaster, Christ and Mohammed.\"  The Baha'is-- regarded as the largest non-Muslim religious minority in Iran -- say they have 5 million members across the globe, and about 300,000 in Iran.", "Q": ["Q: who was arrested?

{"article": "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (CNN)  -- Former Argentine President Nestor Kirchner resigned as leader of the ruling political party Monday following a poor showing in Sunday's elections, the official news agency Telam reported.  Former Argentine Nestor Kirchner accepts defeat Sunday in legislative elections in Buenos Aires.  The ruling Justicialist Party, or PJ by its Spanish acronym, lost its majority in the Chamber of Deputies after being defeated in 18 of 60 races, the newspaper Clarin reported in its Monday editions. The party also lost four Senate contests.  The new composition of Congress could shift power away from Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, Kirchner's wife.  Nestor Kirchner also lost a race for a congressional seat in Buenos Aires province.  He lost his bid to Francisco de Narvaez, who leads a rival Peronist party, Union PRO, by a tally of 34.6 percent to 32.1 percent.  The Kirchners' party also lost in some of the most important urban centers, including Santa Fe, Cordoba, Mendoza and Entre Rios.  Argentina's ability to withstand the global economic slowdown was a key election issue. Economic indicators from Argentina look good, but there is broad agreement among analysts that indicators such as inflation are underreported by as much as half.  An effort by Cristina Kirchner, who succeeded her husband, to tax agricultural exports led to a standoff with angry farmers who ultimately forced the government to backpedal.  \"The Kirchners have been weakened by this latest economic crisis,\" said Robert Pastor, who was a Latin America national security adviser for former President Carter.  The election could signal that the limelight on the country's most powerful political couple could be evaporating.  \"They'll probably begin to fade from the scene,\" said Peter Hakim, president of the Inter-American Dialogue policy institute. \"It's going to be very hard for them to govern unless they do something they haven't been willing to do -- compromise and reach consensus.\"  CNN's Arthur Brice contributed to this report.", "Q": ["Q: what does the analyst say?

{"article": " -- Radical Islamist fighters seized control of the seat of Somalia's U.N.-backed transitional government Monday, raiding the parliament building and demanding that several lawmakers publicly surrender, according to a journalist who witnessed the spectacle.  Members of the Somali Transitional Federal Parliament are meeting in the neighboring country of Djibouti.  Al-Shabab fighters took over the parliament building and the presidential palace in Baidoa, in the southwestern part of the country, a day after the Ethiopian troops who had backed up the transitional government left the country.  The insurgents captured five members of parliament and paraded them through the city streets, with hundreds of residents looking on, the reporter said. The five were released after publicly surrendering.  The situation left Somali lawmakers stranded in the neighboring country of Djibouti, where they often convene and where talks on forming a new government are under way.  \"We have nowhere to return to,\" Parliament Speaker Aden Mohamed Nur told fellow lawmakers there.  Somalia's U.N.-backed transitional government took office after Ethiopian troops invaded the country at its request in December 2006. The Ethiopian invasion ousted the Islamic Courts Union, an Islamist movement that had claimed control of the capital Mogadishu earlier that year.  Ethiopia's invasion had the blessing of the United States, which accused the Islamic Courts Union of harboring fugitives from al Qaeda. But various Islamist groups -- including the hard-line Al-Shabab, which the United States has designated a terror organization -- rejected the presence of Ethiopian forces and mounted an insurgent campaign against the Ethiopians and the transitional government.  Ethiopia announced on Sunday that all its forces have left Somalia. Last week, as Ethiopian troops began pulling out of the Somali capital, forces from different Islamist groups -- including Al-Shabab -- took control of bases the Ethiopians abandoned around Mogadishu.  The transitional government maintained very little control outside of Baidoa, even with the support of the Ethiopian forces. It has also been wracked by an internal power struggle between Prime Minister Nur Hassan Hussein and President Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed, who resigned in December.  In Washington, the State Department said U.S. officials are working to independently confirm the reports from Baidoa. But State Department spokesman Gordon Duguid said members of one of the major Islamic factions, which signed a peace agreement in October in Djibouti, are already joining the transitional government.  Duguid said the Alliance for the Re-liberation of Somalia, another offshoot of the ICU, will choose up to 200 new members of the transitional parliament. Another 75 members will be drawn from other opposition groups, and the expanded parliament is expected to elect a new president soon.  \"We remain deeply concerned about the ongoing violence in southern Somalia, which continues to claim innocent lives,\" Duguid said. \"Lasting peace and stability in Somalia can only be established through the reconciliation process underway through the Djibouti Agreement and rejection of extremism.\"  With Monday's takeover of Baidoa, the transitional government only has control of the presidential palace in the Somali capital of Mogadishu and the road to the airport in the capital city, which it holds with the help of African Union forces.

{"article": " -- Since 2\u00bd-year-old Ava Zinna ended up in the emergency room  this summer after an allergic reaction to peanuts, her mother, Tara, has worried about her daughter's food whenever they eat out. But when the family went to Blue Smoke restaurant Sunday afternoon in New York, someone had already asked to hold the peanuts.  Ava Zinna ate an allergen-free meal at the Worry Free Dinners event on Sunday.  The Zinnas took part in Worry Free Dinners, a series of monthly meals for people with food allergies. Sunday's 16-person barbecue -- complete with ribs, chicken, burgers and brownies -- was the first event aimed directly at parents and children affected by food allergies.  \"When you're going into a restaurant environment, you're putting your child's safety and livelihood into other hands,\" Tara Zinna said. At the Worry Free Dinners event, \"not only was the food phenomenal, but it's wonderful to have an opportunity to interact with other families who are dealing with similar issues.\"  The recent \"worry free\" meal event took place just days before the Food and Drug Administration's September 16 public hearing on food ingredient labels. Since 2006, food manufacturers have been required to clearly label products that contain any of the most common allergens -- milk, eggs, fish, shellfish, peanuts, tree nuts, wheat and soy -- but some allergy experts say the labels should be more explicit.  Restaurant dining can be a terrifying experience for people with severe food allergies. When the meal arrives, there's often no way of knowing every single ingredient that went into it, or what else touched the plate and utensils used to serve it. You also have to pester the restaurant staff with special requests.  But with Worry Free Dinners, everyone has some kind of experience with all of that, which helps build camaraderie, said Sloane Miller, who started organizing the events in April.  Read more tips on how to manage food allergies \u00bb  \"People sit down and start chatting immediately like they're old friends,\" said Miller, known in the blogosphere as \"Allergic Girl.\" \"It's so nice to be with people that you don't have to explain [to] why you want something on the side.\"  So far, Worry Free Dinners has catered to food allergy sufferers in New York -- there are about 12 million in America, according to the Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network (FAAN) -- but Miller is looking to take the concept to other cities.  A common but mysterious condition  One out of every 17 children under 3 years old in America has a food allergy, and some will outgrow their sensitivities, said Anne Munoz-Furlong, founder and CEO of FAAN. But allergies to peanuts, nuts, shellfish and fish tend to be lifelong, she said. As far as she knows, Worry Free Dinners is the first event series of its kind.  Experts agree that allergies in general -- both food and inhalant -- are on the rise, but no one is sure why. Research on food allergies has been slow because \"for a long time, people thought this was a small problem,\" Munoz-Furlong said. The largest group of studies on the subject are in progress, including immunotherapy for people with peanut and milk allergies, she said.  The majority of food allergy cases -- about 80 percent -- are \"cyclic,\" with mild symptoms that resemble those of pollen or dust allergies: sneezing, itchy eyes, and nasal congestion, said Dr. Alpen Patel, assistant professor of otolaryngology at Emory University. Other people experience nausea, vomiting and diarrhea consistently in response to certain foods.  But for some people, ingesting something that even accidentally touched tree nuts or peanuts could result in anaphylaxis, a severe reaction that can lead to blocked airways, cardiovascular collapse, and even death. This is called a \"fixed food allergy,\" he said.  After one severe reaction, he said, most people consistently avoid the offending food and do not experience another severe attack. But they also always carry a shot of epinephrine to self-administer immediately in case they experience signs of anaphylaxis.  Enjoying food in spite of allergies  Miller has made a career of helping people with food allergies and other special dietary needs navigate their meals, whether at Thanksgiving or on a date, without feeling sick. She runs her own coaching practice, blogs and organizes Worry Free Dinners events under her umbrella organization Allergic Girl Resources Inc.  She herself has dealt with allergies all her life -- as a baby she developed a rash when her mother switched from breast milk to cow's milk, and at age 2 she had a reaction to tree nuts. She has since learned that she also has some form of allergy to salmon, lemon grass, eggplant, some types of melons and most tropical fruits.  But Miller, now 36, did not want her food allergies to prevent her from sampling the cornucopia of New York City restaurants. She developed relationships with restaurants that would accommodate her needs, and began organizing dinners for people who have similar allergy problems.  \"It is both worry-free for the diner and worry-free for the restaurant,\" she said. \"Restaurants appreciate that I'm looking out for them as well... I want to make it as easy as possible for them to have people like me come in all the time.\"  Where everybody knows your name  So how does someone like Miller, who lives with food allergies plus a \"wheat/gluten-free, processed sugar-free, lactose-free, soy-free, low processed food-free lifestyle,\" safely enjoy eating out?  Miller calls it the \"Cheers\" experience. The first time she goes to a restaurant, she always calls ahead and talks with the restaurant management to make sure they can accommodate her before making a reservation.  Once at the restaurant, she'll meet the manager and give him or her a card with a run-down of her special dietary needs. Often a chef will join Miller and the manager to discuss the menu. By this point, Miller says, everyone has been introduced by name.  After the meal, Miller thanks the server, chef and manager, and tips the server generously. She'll often call the next day and thank the manager for helping her eat safely.  On her blog, allergicgirl.blogspot.com, Miller finds no shortage of restaurant meals to recommend and photograph. She'll find creative alternatives to traditionally prepared foods that look no less appetizing than more familiar versions -- for instance, she recently had fish-free sushi made of potato tempura, sticky rice, avocado and sesame seeds.  Not every restaurant will accommodate Miller's special needs -- she has been refused service at some restaurants. But in general, she's found that restaurants have become far more understanding than five years ago, if only because staff members have children with food allergies.  \"That changes how they run their kitchen,\" she said. \"More and more people are touched by this, and do get it.\"", "Q": ["Q: What dpes a woman organize for food allergy sufferers?

{"article": "Atlanta, Georgia (CNN)  -- A third beluga whale belonging to the world's largest aquarium has died, the Georgia Aquarium announced late Monday.  The exact cause of Nico's sudden death on Saturday is inconclusive from the initial necropsy or animal autopsy. The Georgia Aquarium hopes to find out more information in the months ahead from a more detailed necropsy.  \"As we work with and care for the many animals at the Georgia Aquarium, we become attached emotionally,\" said Dr. Gregory D. Bossart, chief veterinary officer at the aquarium. \"The loss is not unlike that of faithful dog or special horse that has been a part your life for years.\"  Nico died at Sea World in San Antonio, where he and two other beluga whales had been moved temporarily while the Georgia Aquarium is undergoing renovation. Nico was scheduled to return home to Atlanta next month with companions Maris and Natasha.  Nico arrived in Atlanta with Gaspar, two whales obtained from a park in Mexico. Both animals suffered \"significant health issues\" from their times in a foreign park and were essentially \"living on borrowed time,\" said Bossart, who had been caring for the two whales as far as nine years ago, while they were still in Mexico.  \"We rescued Nico knowing that he had health issues due to his prior home, but we were confident that we could provide a better quality of life for his final years,\" Bossart said.  Gaspar was suffering from a bone disease contracted before arriving at the downtown Atlanta aquarium and was euthanized in January 2007. Another beluga whale, Marina, died 11 months later from complications of old age.  Beluga whales or white whales, whose name is derived from a Russian word meaning white, typically live in Arctic and sub-Arctic regions including Canada, Russia, Greenland and the U.S. state of Alaska. They can live up to 35 years.  The belugas are not the only high-profile deaths at the Georgia Aquarium, which opened in late 2005. A pair of whale sharks have also died at the eight-million-gallon facility, the only one outside Asia to display the giant fish.

Pat Quinn wants a review of state government practices completed in 100 days.  \"I think we are sending a message to the people of Illinois that we understand that integrity is No. 1 when it comes to the government of the Land of Lincoln,\" he said of his executive order.  Quinn had set up the commission earlier this year when he was lieutenant governor under Rod Blagojevich, whom lawmakers impeached earlier this month and removed from office Thursday.  His executive order \"formally establishes the Illinois Reform Commission under the auspices of the governor's office,\" he said at a news conference.  The commission, led by former U.S. Attorney Patrick Collins, is an independent body that aims to evaluate existing Illinois law and practices in government, according to its Web site.  It says it will release an initial report outlining its findings and recommendations in about 100 days.  Quinn said there is \"an integrity crisis\" in Illinois. \"We're going to start to fumigate state government from top to bottom to make sure that it has no corruption,\" he said.  The Illinois Senate on Thursday voted unanimously to remove impeached Blagojevich from office.  A second vote, to prevent him from holding future state office, also passed unanimously.  Watch reaction to Blagojevich ouster \u00bb  Blagojevich said he was sad and disappointed by the Senate's decision but not surprised.  He was arrested on federal corruption charges in December.

{"article": "LITTLE ROCK, Arkansas (CNN) -- Carlotta Walls LaNier points out the only two African-Americans in her senior class as she flips through her high school yearbook. She pauses when she sees the picture on a page dedicated to \"Integration.\"  Carlotta Walls LaNier and eight other members of the Little Rock Nine are invited to Obama's inauguration.  It's been nearly five decades since LaNier graduated from Little Rock Central High School in Arkansas.  \"It shows how the 101st were on the grounds of the school,\" says LaNier.  In 1957, soldiers from the 101st Airborne Division, an elite Army unit, escorted LaNier and eight other African-American students into the all-white public high school. The students, who became known as the Little Rock Nine, were taunted and threatened by an angry mob.  \"We knew we could not participate in extracurricular activities,\" recalls LaNier. \"There was one who could have been in the band, one who could have been on track. I was the one who played basketball... I couldn't do that.\"  Back then, LaNier thought once the doors of equality were open it wouldn't be long before an African-American became president.  \"I had hoped to see something like that in the next 10 or 15 years when I was in high school but that didn't happen,\" says LaNier.  What has happened is a new generation of students walks the halls at Central High. Even though the exterior looks the same as it did during integration -- the interior would be almost unrecognizable to LaNier and the other Little Rock Nine.  Student: I can't believe it happened here, but I'm glad it did \u00bb  Today, the sea of mostly white faces has disappeared. The hallways are now filled with a more racially diverse student body. Students take a class to learn about the school's history and many say it's given them a greater appreciation for racial tolerance.  \"Now it's definitely hard to imagine -- you walk into the halls and you see people of all different races are in the hallway. And in addition, the majority of our school is African-American now,\" points out Afshar Sanati, student body president. \"It is hard for me to walk inside the school every day and see how this place could have been such a hostile environment for nine African-American students.\"  LaNier is still humble when she reflects on her experience.  \"We all knew that we were giving up something for a bigger cause and [we were] happy that we did it,\" says LaNier. \"Because it has been 51 years, I think they were baby steps now. But they were big steps then.\"  The steps taken by the Little Rock Nine were so big, in fact, they received personal invitations to attend President-elect Barack Obama's inauguration.  \"I think the Little Rock Nine set the foundation,\" says student Sarah Karney. \"I don't think [Obama's election] could have happened without them.\"  Today, many students at Central High see themselves as the beneficiaries of an Obama presidency.  \"Him being president means there actually is a chance for anyone to do what they want to do if they work hard enough,\" says Helena Liu, who says she doesn't see race when she looks at Obama.  \"It doesn't depend on your race -- it depends on who you are, the quality of your character,\" says DeIvory Howard.  \"[We've] got to get past just the color of our skins being newsworthy. It's really about all the things we knew we could do for this country and now we have the opportunity to show it and it's going to come through his leadership,\" says LaNier. \"And, we're looking forward to that.\"  Senior Chris Bell couldn't agree more.  \"This election proves that this America is just not the old America.

{"article": "(EW.com) -- There's no denying the power of the romantic comedy, even if \"Valentine's Day,\" the movie, is as manufactured as the holiday itself.  The all-star film grossed an estimated $52.4 million over three days and is likely to top $60 million by the time the Presidents Day holiday weekend is over. Its high-grossing debut -- the best ever for Presidents Day -- coupled with solid numbers from the other two new wide releases put 2010's holiday frame into the record books with an estimated total gross of $193 million.  \"Percy Jackson & The Olympians,\" based on the popular kids' book series by author Rick Riordan, earned an estimated $31.1 million for the three days while the R-rated horror remake \"Wolfman,\" starring Benicio del Toro, grossed an estimated $30.6 million for a per-theater average of $9,497.  \"Avatar,\" in its ninth weekend of release, grossed another $22 million, falling only 4 percent from its previous weekend and putting its total cume close to $660 million.  Last weekend's winner, \"Dear John,\" dropped into fifth place for the frame. Losing 50 percent of its value, primarily off of \"Valentine's Day\" competition, the film earned $15.3 million.

{"article": " -- A lock break occurred on the Ohio River near Warsaw, Kentucky, on Sunday, stopping barge traffic for several hours as the Army Corps of Engineers investigated.  The lock break stopped traffic on the Ohio River about 65 miles northeast of Louisville, Kentucky.  The incident involved structures, and there were no reports of injuries.  All traffic on the river was stopped in both directions at about 9 a.m. ET, Corps spokesman Todd Hornback said. By 8 p.m., an auxiliary lock was set up to start allowing the half-dozen blocked barges through.  \"It's going to take more time, but we're keeping the river open tonight,\" Hornback said.  The river is a major artery for commodities shipping, with more than 50 million tons of cargo passing through the affected area annually, according to a waterways organization.  It was not known what caused the break at the Markland Locks and Dam. Engineers were going to the site, about 65 miles northeast of Louisville, Kentucky, Hornback said.  The lock's gates are 1,200 feet long and 110 feet wide. A smaller auxiliary lock is 600 feet long and 110 feet wide.  Watch traffic backed up on Ohio River \u00bb  A lock is a section of a waterway, such as a river, that is closed off with gates. Vessels in transit enter the lock and the water level is raised or lowered in order to raise or lower the vessel to adjust to elevation changes.  One of the broken portions is known as a miter gate, Hornback said. The Corps of Engineers, on its Web site, says a miter gate \"has two leaves that provide a closure at one end of the lock.\" They are so named because the two leaves meet at an angle pointing upstream and resembling a miter joint, the Web site said, referring to a joint meeting at a 45-degree angle, such as the corner of a picture frame.  A public policy organization, in a February 2008 report, graded the locks' performance as a D, \"based primarily upon risk of failure due to unreliability of miter gates.\"  The federal government allocated $10.6 million to install new chamber miter gates, according to Waterways Council Inc., which describes itself as an organization \"advocating a modern and well-maintained national system of ports and inland waterways.\"  Hornback said the work was scheduled for 2011, adding that it's unclear whether Sunday's break will speed that up.  \"The risk is very high that a failure of the lock gates will occur, forcing traffic through the auxiliary lock for an extended period, causing huge delays and costs to the towing industry,\" the council said in the report last year.  Engineers hope to have the river back open as soon as possible, Hornback said, but an exact time frame was not known.  Some 55 million tons of commodities pass through the Markland Locks each year, according to the Waterways Council. The principal commodity passing through Markland is coal, which fuels numerous electric power plants along the Ohio River, and those plants typically stockpile only about a 30-day supply, the council said.", "Q": ["Q: Where did the break occur?

Michael Jackson gestures to the crowd at the March announcement of his series of London concerts.  The delay comes days after the concert promoter said Jackson was in good health, contrary to media reports he was diagnosed with skin cancer.  Jackson's \"This Is It\" shows were to begin July 8 at London's 20,000-capacity O2 Arena.  \"It was not an easy decision to change the schedule but in the end we wanted to ensure that all of Michael's fans attending the concerts get the same quality in staging and level of entertainment,\" said the Ticketmaster e-mail sent to someone who bought tickets for the third show.  \"In order to deliver a phenomenal and unprecedented show -- the first show on the 8th July will take place on 13th July 2009,\" according AEG Live, the promoter of the London concerts. \"The subsequent shows on 10th July will be moved to 1st March 2010, 12th July will be moved to 3rd March 2010, and the show on the 14th July will be moved to 6th March 2010.\"  The delay is \"due to the sheer magnitude\" of the concerts, AEG said. The decision \"to move back a few of the opening shows\" was needed \"in order to meet the challenges presented by such a massive and technically complex show,\" it said.  Randy Phillips, president and CEO of AEG Live, last week denied reports that Jackson had skin cancer.  \"He's as healthy as he can be -- no health problems whatsoever,\" the executive told CNN on Saturday.  \"Michael, who is directly involved with all aspects of the styling/choreography/band selection and rehearsals, is working around the clock to ensure this is the show to end all shows!\" AEG said in it's delay announcement.

The WHO added that the virus had spread to 11 countries, but the hardest hit areas were in the western hemisphere.  \"We have not seen sustained human to human transmission anywhere outside the Americas region,\" said WHO spokesman Thomas Abraham.  Two more countries, Denmark and China, reported cases of the 2009 H1N1 \"swine flu\" virus on Friday, but they were still to be confirmed by the WHO.  The largest outbreak was in Mexico which had 156 confirmed cases, while there were 141 cases confirmed and one death in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  The WHO said Mexico had 9 deaths attributed to the virus. But Mexican officials said the death toll had risen to 12.  However, more than 150 deaths in Mexico are suspected to have been caused by the virus and are being investigated, officials there said.  The higher totals do not necessarily mean that incidence of the disease is increasing, but rather that health investigators are going through their backlog of specimens, said Dr. Keiji Fukuda, assistant director-general of WHO.  In addition to Mexico and the United States, the following countries have so far confirmed non-lethal cases:  Austria: 1  Canada: 34  China: 1 Denmark: 1 Germany: 3 Israel: 2  Netherlands: 1  New Zealand: 3  Spain: 13  Switzerland: 1  United Kingdom: 9  An additional 642 cases are being investigated in the United Kingdom, and Spain has 84 suspected cases.

{"article": " -- In the midst of a swirl of rumors about Herman Cain, a woman who accuses him of sexual harassment holds a news conference. Her attorney, Gloria Allred, employs her studied grimace as Sharon Bialek tells of an encounter 14 years ago that, if true, constitutes an unreported sexual assault. At his own press conference the next day, candidate Cain issues a heated denial, having earlier hinted at a willingness to take a lie detector test.  How would the court system, America's formal arbiter of truth, evaluate the competing claims?  The courts would refuse to even consider them. In the legal world, courts scrupulously enforce statutes of limitations on accusations of improper or criminal conduct. The rules exist because it is unfair to force the accused to defend against a charge of ancient vintage. Witness memories and evidence have grown stale and the courts believe that evidence is best evaluated and most reliable when it is fresh.  The rare exceptions to this rule almost always involve the abuse of children and particularly heinous crimes like murder. The law provides no sanctuary for women who seek to resurrect sexual harassment claims from as distant as 14 years in the past.  But Herman Cain now exists in the realm of politics and not the courtroom. Cain must find a way to prove his innocence to a skeptical public regarding a suspiciously large number of claims for which the statute of limitations has long since expired. Unfortunately, finding a path to the truth of sex harassment charges can often be a perilous journey.  Today, most professionals structure their interactions with employees of the opposite sex carefully to avoid even the hint of sexual impropriety. Glass-walled office suites are the norm, insuring that employee relationships remain open to public view. The world of \"Mad Men's\" Don Draper and his blatantly sexual overtures to female employees is mostly a thing of the past. Today's sexual harassment is far more subtle.  Although legitimate claims deserve compensation, the sex harassment litigation story has a seedy underside. False complaints are sometimes rewarded with generous monetary awards and then hidden from public view with confidentiality agreements and sealing orders.  Employment lawyers are accustomed to meeting with CEO clients who are initially defiant and determined to resist a false claim of sexual harassment. They want their reputations and integrity preserved. But when a high-ranking executive is involved, the company rumor vine begins to grow. Depositions are taken. Employees are pulled out of the workplace to back one side or the other. Sterling reputations begin to bleed under the slash of a thousand paper cuts.  And of course, the litigation process is expensive for the company. Knowing this, experienced lawyers often urge even the innocent accused executive to agree to mediate claims informally and avoid the possibility of a very public and very embarrassing federal lawsuit. Legitimate victims are also urged to settle rather than risk losing at trial.  Once mediation begins, the parties are told that public humiliation and legal costs can be avoided with a quiet, confidential settlement. Both plaintiff and defendant are simultaneously silenced by the agreement's penalty provisions. The truth of the claims will never be tested in any public forum.  That is, unless the accused decides to run for public office. Then it appears the art of the leak can undermine the solidity of even the most carefully drafted of confidentiality agreements.  Herman Cain said he never consented to the mediation process. The National Restaurant Association, through its board, might have negotiated its own deal with the two women who made allegations of sexual misconduct against Cain to avoid bad publicity and legal costs. Businesses will often \"settle and seal\" the case rather than endure the expense and embarrassment of defending even a falsely accused chief executive.  Based on the sketchy reported accounts, the initial case against Cain might have been paper-thin. There is no assertion of overt sexual contact between him and the female employees in question. The website Politico, which broke the story, refers to witness accounts of episodes of conversations filled with \"innuendo\" and of \"physical gestures that were not overtly sexual\" but which made female employees feel uncomfortable.  No one who has followed Cain's astonishingly successful presidential campaign would be surprised to hear that he uses blunt language and gestures to express himself. The question of whether this blunt language constituted true sexual harassment may never be known.  The claimant represented by attorney Joel Bennett, and recently identified as a federal government employee, has refused to go public despite the National Restaurant Association's highly unusual decision to release her from the negotiated confidentiality agreement. The second and third women remain anonymous, while Bialek surfaces with very old, never formally reported claims. In a court of law, Cain would clearly win.  But in this case we are not litigating a claim but selecting a president. The American public, exercising its common sense about the character and integrity of this presidential candidate, will be the only and final judge of the facts of this case. Given the secrecy of the sex harassment litigation process and the grave difficulty in determining the truth of old and moldy claims, it looks like a hung jury is the likely outcome.

{"article": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- British Prime Minister Gordon Brown's wife, Sarah, wore an outfit from designer Britt Lintner to greet President Obama and his wife, Michelle, while Michelle Obama wore J.Crew, according to spokeswomen for both sides.  Sarah Brown, left, wears a dress from an American designer. Michelle Obama wears J.Crew.  Both women later changed and wore other designer outfits for the formal pre-G-20 summit dinner at 10 Downing Street, the British prime minister's official residence.  Wednesday morning, Sarah Brown wore a one-of-a-kind navy dress with red lining by the American-born Lintner, a spokeswoman for 10 Downing Street said.  The designer specially made the dress in navy for Brown, but retails the garment in black for $720, Lintner said.  Michelle Obama's outfit included a $158 green skirt and $298 bead and rhinestone cardigan from J.Crew, the store's Web site showed.  Brown also wore a pair of Astley Clarke earrings, according to a spokeswoman from 10 Downing Street. The Astley Clarke Web site sells earrings from less than $100 to more than $10,000.  The first ladies' choices of outfits during this summit are being closely watched by the world's media, both in terms of style and comparative cost.  Both women pay for all of their clothes themselves and receive no clothing allowance, according to spokeswomen for both sides.  Lintner first designed a dress for Brown for the British Fashion Council Awards in November 2007, Lintner said. She sells to clients only through her West London studio and said she started her company out of frustration over the selection of workwear available for women. Although the clothes are expensive, she said, they are made to last.  This is not the first time Michelle Obama has chosen an \"off the rack\" outfit. She has worn J.Crew before, including in American Vogue.  When appearing on \"The Tonight Show\" with Jay Leno, she wore a J.Crew ensemble, on which she commented, \"You get some good stuff online.\"  After the photo call, Obama and Brown visited Maggie's Cancer Caring Center, where Brown is a patron.  The spouses of the G-20 leaders have several events scheduled during their stay in London. On Tuesday, Brown will be host of a dinner for G-20 spouses.  The dinner will take place at No. 11 Downing Street, the London residence of the chancellor of the exchequer, while the G-20 leaders take a working dinner next door at No. 10.  As well as the spouses of the G-20 leaders, prominent women in British sport, arts, fashion, charity and business are also expected to attend. Downing Street has said those invited are \"all intended to show off British talent.\"  Those invited include \"Harry Potter\" author J.K. Rowling, supermodel Naomi Campbell and Olympic gold medal runner Kelly Holmes. Downing Street sources said Michelle Obama will be seated between Holmes and Rowling.  The spouses also will visit the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden, London.

{"article": "Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- Raymond Thomas is a jolly man who laughs easily and likes to say \"Forget it\" a lot.  He'd like to forget the devastation wrought at the Port-au-Prince harbor where his fleet of trucks used to pick up cargo.  Tuesday's 7.0-magnitude earthquake sent a quarter-mile pier crumbling into the sea along with two of his trucks. The few workers who went into the water swam to safety, Thomas said, but the port remains shut down, and desperately needed aid cannot be unloaded quickly.  \"Now we're just starving to death,\" he said, worried that the airport and smaller harbors cannot handle the necessary volume of relief supplies.  \"That was the whole country right there,\" he added, pointing at two toppled cranes on the remains of the pier that stand out against the clear-blue sky.  Thomas owns Raymond and Sons Trucking, a fleet of 35 trucks that haul cargo from the port. The company employed about 50 employees, all of them now out of work.  \"I'm out,\" Thomas said.  The port won't be back for a while. Roads have been split apart and buckled, fences have fallen over.  \"Oh, forget it,\" Thomas said. \"Forget it. It might take a year to rebuild it. Forget it.\"  Yet he feels fortunate because although his home was destroyed and his business is shattered, no one in his family died in the quake.  Asked what happened, he demurs with a hearty laugh. \"Forget it,\" he says. \"I don't want to talk about it.\"  He then relents, calling his family's survival \"a miracle.\"  His wife was outside their house and he was driving home in his red 1995 Honda CRV sport utility vehicle.  \"I felt like the whole car was going to take off like an airplane,\" he said, laughing.  He wasn't wearing a seat belt, he admits.  \"This is Haiti. In Miami, I wear a seat belt.\" Another laugh.  Thomas' 40-year-old daughter, Marjorie, and her 15-month-old son had just left earlier that afternoon to return to her home in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.  Asked if it was a miracle that she missed the quake by such a short time, he laughs again, saying, \"You bet your sweet heart.\"  On Friday, he was wearing a bullet-proof vest after someone tried to rob him the day before. Someone wanted to take his cell phone he said, and the port is near the roughest part of town.  For now, Thomas and his wife are sleeping in a tent.  And for now, also, his mind is on the port. He's not alone.  Tug boat owner Roger Rouzier also seem a dim future without the port.  \"We cannot receive the help by plane,\" Rouzier said Friday. \"We need to receive help by boat.\"  Rouzier estimates that before the earthquake, more than 70 ships each unloaded about 8,000 tons of material every month.  \"I personally unload three or four a day,\" he said. \"The whole country depends on this port. If we're going to save people, we have to do it by boat.\"  Without the port, Thomas sees serious consequences for Haiti, one of the poorest nations on Earth.  \"We'll starve to death, that's all,\" he said. \"We'll just starve to death.\"  And it won't take long for trouble to reach the streets, he said. Especially since many of the nation's criminals escaped when Port-au-Prince's prison collapsed in the quake.  \"Very soon we're going to have a riot,\" Thomas said, this time not laughing.

{"article": "  -- Congressional auditors have uncovered widespread abuse of techniques used to restrain or discipline special-education students in U.S. schools, with some deaths linked to the practices, a top congressman says.  Investigators in Utah say a teacher left Garrett Peck in an isolation cubicle for at least two and a half hours.  The findings are among those expected from a Government Accountability Office report scheduled to be released Tuesday. The report documented serious problems with the way children with disabilities are being treated in public schools, including cases of children being held face-down on the ground.  The GAO report was prepared for the House Education and Labor Committee, which is considering new laws governing what actions teachers can take to rein in disruptive special-needs students.  \"I think what we're going to hear from the GAO is that very often, special-need children are subjected to the policies of seclusion and policies of restraint that have turned out to be lethal in a number of circumstances,\" said Rep. George Miller, D-California, the committee's chairman.  In other cases, children as young as 6 have been locked away \"for hours at a time,\" Miller said.  \"What the GAO is telling us is that that policy is fairly widespread,\" he said. \"The state regulations about how to handle these incidents don't exist in about half the states, and in other states you have kind of a patchwork of regulations.\"  The GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, found that state laws governing the treatment of the more than 6 million children classified as having \"special needs\" -- conditions including autism and Down syndrome -- are patchy at best. Teachers and school staff frequently lack training in correct restraint methods, and in some cases, where improper restraints led to injuries, teachers often kept their jobs.  Only five states keep track of incidents where special-needs students are separated or restrained. Parents contacted by CNN commonly said they were not told their child was being disciplined until he or she began to behave badly at home -- a sign of trouble at school.  When confronted with complaints, school systems sometimes sought to minimize or deny the allegations, even after public investigations found the charges to be true. And parents told CNN that when they got into a dispute with the teacher, their child was made to suffer as retribution.  Some of the most disturbing reports concerned the use of seclusion rooms. Experts have long recommended that children should only be isolated when they pose an immediate threat to themselves or others. But CNN found that isolation was often used as a punishment by teachers to compel the students to follow instructions.  State investigators in Utah found a teacher left 7-year-old Garrett Peck in an isolation cubicle for at least two and a half hours after the teacher said he told her to \"shut up.\"  While the boy was in the cubicle, the teacher taunted him by playing his favorite video and telling him what he was missing. His parents, Joshua and Becca Peck, said the child has an attention span of about 10 minutes, and they believe that after the first few minutes, he had no idea why he was in the cubicle.  \"It was so sad. We felt it was a form of torture for him but he, being autistic, he had no way to express it,\" Joshua Peck said. \"He couldn't tell.\"  And Becca Peck said her son had been left in the cubicle with nothing but a magic marker -- which he used to scrawl all over himself. When she came to school to pick him up, \"He was covered in marker -- on his eyelids, on his hair, face, clothes, arms, eyelids -- everywhere.\"  \"I started thinking, 'What was he thinking?' Was he thinking, 'Why is my mom letting this person do this to me? Why am I here? I trust no one now.' \"  In Garrett's case, like others cited by the GAO, the teacher remains on the job. And what frustrates experts is that efforts to force unruly children to comply don't actually work.  At one school in Pennsylvania, however, teachers appear to have better results using sharply different methods.  The Centennial School at Lehigh University serves severely emotionally disturbed children that have been passed from school to school, and even from juvenile justice centers. When school director Michael George came to Centennial in 1999, the school had documented more than 1,000 cases of restraint and seclusion that year. After the school revamped its approach, no such incidents were reported.  When they get to Centennial, students can be violent and aggressive. But instead of trying to force a change in behavior, the school teaches the children new skills to get what they need. Children who might be violent because they are desperate to escape an uncomfortable task or environment learn to communicate their discomfort in nonviolent ways.  Children who need to move frequently -- a common trait with conditions such as autism -- are permitted to do so, then re-directed to the task at hand. Staff are forbidden from saying anything negative about the children, parents or other teachers, even among themselves.  And when a child acts violently, the staff is trained to step aside, rather than immediately attempt a potentially dangerous restraint. On a recent visit to the school, all students appeared to be calm and receptive to teachers.  The school's philosophy can be summed up in a question George likes to ask teachers interviewing for jobs there: Which teacher you remember most from your own childhood?  \"No one ever mentions the person who yelled at them, who screamed at them, who told them to write a phrase a hundred times, who slammed them into closets, who was abrupt, who made them feel stupid. No one ever mentions those people,\" said George.  \"Our job is to teach. Sometimes the children we are teaching here present extraordinary challenges; it can be very, very difficult. But that's the job we chose to do.\"", "Q": ["Q: Which states keep track of incidents and/or have regulations in place to keep this kind of abuse from happening?

{"article": " -- Simon Cowell may not recognize \"American Idol\" alumna Mandisa the next time he sees her.  Mandisa, who appeared on season five of \"American Idol,\" has lost more than 75 pounds.  The woman about whom the acerbic \"American Idol\" judge once said, \"We're going to have to get a bigger stage,\" has lost 75 pounds -- and hopes to lose 100 or more.  Though she has long forgiven Cowell for his snippy comments during season five about her weight, she said she still wants to lose more in part because he is a father figure for her. The last time he saw her was last season when she had lost a few pounds. He raved about how nice she looked then.  \"He was very encouraging and saying how proud he was of me,\" she said. \"It's sort of like your dad who you really want to please. I want to please him and to show him that I am doing well.\"  Mandisa, whose full name is Mandisa Hundley, said that her faith in God has guided her new lifestyle.  \"It's more than the physical and more than what I am eating. It's a spiritual change,\" she said. \"I've had to not turn to food for comfort and validation anymore, and that is a complete mind change. Because my entire life, that is what I have done.\"  She named her new album, \"Freedom,\" due out March 24, after the feeling she has gotten breaking what she calls her food addiction.  It follows a successful debut CD, \"True Beauty,\" of which Entertainment Weekly said, \"Plus-size powerhouse Mandisa... realizes her considerable pipes and self-righteousness are best suited to Christian pop.\" It sold more than 160,000 copies.  The new album is full of catchy Christian pop tunes such as \"My Deliverer,\" \"Dance Dance Dance\" and \"Freedom Song,\" and power ballads such as \"Not Guilty.\"  The song that is nearest to her heart is \"You Wouldn't Cry,\" a tune based on a fan whom Mandisa met and corresponded with who lost her unborn child. Mandisa said that when she went to put together a CD of songs to help comfort her friend, she couldn't find anything from the child's point of view.  \"I wanted to write a song about what Andrew would say to his mom about the fact that he's in heaven,\" Mandisa said. \"For people who have faced the situation where a loved one had gone to be with the Lord, I think the song will mean a lot to them.\"  She called \"My Deliverer\" her personal testimony. In the chorus she sings:  My deliverer, you rescued me from all that held me captive  My deliverer, you set me free  Now I'm alive and I can live  The song as a first single is \"perfect, because it's a kind of been my story over these past few months\" of her weight loss.  When CNN.com first spoke to Mandisa in January, she was singing on a cruise ship. (Yes, Simon, a cruise ship.) \"I think that this is a cruise ship like no other,\" she said of the K-Love Family and Friends cruise, a gathering of Christian music bands and their fans.  She beamed with pride then as she described her new exercise regimen and diet. The most difficult part has been to retrain her mind to turn to God instead of turning to food, she said. She also talked about her time on the show that brought her to America's attention.  \"American Idol's\" producers gave the fifth-season contestants a speech about being themselves, saying to not pretend to be anybody other than who you are, she said.  \"I don't know that they realized that I was as vocal about my faith as I am,\" she said.  She was caught in controversy when an article in The Advocate questioned whether she was a proponent of the \"ex-gay\" movement. She thinks her critics were too focused on her statements about not agreeing with what she calls \"the lifestyle\" and missed her message of love for everyone.  \"I think that we are called to love people that are different from us and that don't agree with the things we agree with,\" she said.  She still watches \"American Idol\" faithfully, and like many other people tuning in each week, is a fan of Danny Gokey, a 28-year-old widower from Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  She said this week that he is the clear favorite but also likes 23-year-old Matt Giraud from Kalamazoo, Michigan (\"I love his voice\") and Lil Rounds, a mother of three from Memphis, Tennessee (\"I think she's incredible as well\").  \"But I am still rooting for Danny to win,\" she said.  After being booted from \"Idol,\" many observers thought that Mandisa had a good chance of becoming a successful R&B artist. She said she considered that path; it was all she wanted to be when she was growing up. But she felt a call to sing Christian music.  \"Christian music is the music that comes the most naturally for me,\" she said.  The pop world is so big, and it has been easier for \"Idol\" alums who have pursued careers in country or Christian music, she said.  She said she also is pretty passionate about exercising.  \"There's a feeling you get after you exercise; it's just unexplainable,\" she said. \"It makes you know that you have done the right thing for your body.\"  She works out with a trainer three to five times a week, mixing cardio with muscle-building exercises.  \"This is a lifestyle for me.

{"article": "WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- President Richard M. Nixon and his Brazilian counterpart, Emilio Medici, in 1971 discussed ways their countries could work together to overthrow the socialist government of Salvador Allende in Chile, according to a newly declassified document.  President Richard M. Nixon, right, and his Brazilian counterpart, Emilio Medici.  During a meeting of the two leaders at the White House on December 9 of that year, Medici was discussing the possibility of a coup by the Chilean military with assistance from Brazilian military officers when Nixon said that it was \"very important that Brazil and the United States work closely in this field,\" according to the document.  Nixon offered money or other discreet aid for the effort if it could be made available, the document shows.  \"We must try and prevent new Allendes and Castros, and try where possible to reverse these trends,\" Nixon said. Medici said he was \"happy to see that the Brazilian and American positions and views\" were so close.  The declassified document, a previously top secret memorandum for Nixon's file written by National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger, was published by the National Security Archive, a nongovernmental research institute in Washington.  The memorandum, along with other documents, were declassified in July as part of the State Department's Foreign Relations of the United States series.  \"This is an explosive document that details collusion between the colossus of the North [the United States] and the colossus of the South [Brazil],\" said Peter Kornbluh, the director of a Chile and Brazil Documentation Project for the National Security Archive. He called it \"a smoking gun of confirmation of Brazil's effort to engage in operations to overthrow the government of Chile and a discussion of collusion with the United States.\"  The two leaders also discussed the creation of a back channel for direct communication outside normal diplomatic protocols, according to the document. Each designated personal aides to carry handwritten communications back and forth to keep discussions out of official records.  \"I think there is precedent, but we've never seen it detailed in a document this way, in which two presidents set up the utmost secret of back-channel communications so they can discuss the most sensitive aspects of collusion and collaboration in efforts to challenge the left in Latin America and change the futures of select Latin American governments,\" Kornbluh said.  He added that \"there's a significant paper trail of evidence of what that collusion was that remains secret, and we're going to have to press Brazil and Washington to recover those documents.\"  Despite the leaders' effort to keep the subject of their talks secret, word got out.  A declassified CIA memorandum written some time after the Nixon-Medici meeting in Washington said that word of the secret talks between the two leaders about shaping Brazilian foreign policy filtered down to Brazilian military officers by a \"Cabinet leak.\" Gen. Vicente Dale Coutinho, commander of Brazil's 4th Army, reacted to this by saying that the United States obviously wanted Brazil \"to do the dirty work,\" it said.  A declassified CIA national intelligence estimate written in 1972 concluded, \"Brazil will be playing a bigger role in hemispheric affairs and seeking to fill whatever vacuum the U.S. leaves behind. It is unlikely that Brazil will intervene openly in its neighbors' internal affairs, but the regime will not be above using the threat of intervention or tools of diplomacy and covert action to oppose leftist regimes, to keep friendly governments in office, or to help place them there.\"  The newly published documents do not offer any conclusive proof of Brazilian involvement in the Chilean coup of 1973, which the Nixon administration supported.  Kornbluh said that with the passage of time and change in governments in all of the countries involved, the real story of diplomatic and covert collusion between the United States and Brazil in Chile can finally be told.  The National Security Archive will push for the declassification and publication of more top-secret documents from the Nixon library, he said, and will approach Brazilian government officials to ask for their cooperation in getting documents released in Washington and Brasilia, the capital of Brazil.  Kornbluh said he also hopes that surviving Chilean government and military officers from the era who knew of any arrangements with the Brazilian government will come forward and tell their stories.  \"This is history for history's sake, but history will not find closure until it's fully aired,\" he said.", "Q": ["Q: Who met at white house?

{"article": " -- A grizzly bear attacked and killed a hunter Friday in a remote part of northwestern Montana before being gunned down itself, authorities said.  The man who was killed had been part of a hunting party of three men, said Mike Weland, a spokesman for Boundary County, Idaho, which borders Canada and abuts the area where the attack took place.  By the time the other two hunters -- one of whom witnessed the attack -- arrived on the site, the man was dead, Weland said.  One of the victim's hunting partners eventually shot and killed the grizzly, according to the sheriff's office.  Authorities received a cell phone call about 10 a.m. reporting the incident near Buckhorn Mountain, the sheriff's office said. Officials from multiple government agencies were at the site by Friday evening, Weland added a short time later in an e-mail to reporters.  At that point, authorities determined that the incident -- initially believed to have happened in northern Idaho -- actually occurred on the Montana side of Buckhorn Mountain, according to Weland. Boundary County sheriff deputies remain on site, but jurisdiction was being transferred to authorities from Lincoln County, Montana.  Weland said earlier Friday that authorities were talking with the two survivors and could see the attack site from a distance as they climbed.  The sheriff's offices, the Idaho Fish and Game Department, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service are investigating.  The name of the victim, who was not from Boundary County, was not being released until authorities could notify his next of kin.  The incident follows a series of bear attacks in recent months in the United States.  Two men were killed this summer in Yellowstone National Park by grizzly bears, Park Superintendent Dan Wenk said. In August, a lone 50-year-old man was bit by a grizzly bear in Montana's Glacier National Park but was able to continue hiking until he found help, the National Park Service said.  And earlier this month, two young campers were injured when they were attacked by a black bear at Stokes State Forest in northwestern New Jersey, the state's Department of Environmental Protection said.

{"article": "(AOL Autos) -- Have you ever heard of someone having their car \"totaled\"? While the word might conjure images of a massive car accident, replete with broken glass and the Jaws of Life, the reality is sometimes far removed.  Ford's repair and safety engineers first began collaborating on the 2009 F-150 pick-up truck.  In fact, there are many accidents that produce structural damage such that the vehicle's frame is bent, even though the exterior of the car might even look drivable.  Typically these cars are \"totaled,\" which might give buyers the peace of mind knowing they will get a replacement vehicle. But, overall this produces much higher insurance rates for all drivers.  Car companies and insurers are working hard to try and reduce the cost of auto repairs and insurance premiums for consumers and some of the development is breathtaking in its innovation  This effort has already led to many new developments in the design of various auto parts and components -- which have indeed led to a reduction in repair costs for various auto parts, components and structures.  And more advances are on the way: some carmakers have recently ramped up their operations in this area, which should result in greater cost savings in coming years.  One recent development in this area is the Ford Motor Company's new $650,000 Paint and Body Technology Center in Inkster, Michigan, about 20 minutes from the company's Dearborn world headquarters. The new center was created by merging operations with the company's Safety Crash Test Analysis department.  Other car companies have their own versions of this kind of operation, including Ford's crosstown rivals, General Motors Corp. and Chrysler LLC.  The new Ford center represents an advancement over its previous paint and body tech operation in that it's larger, closer to the company's HQ, and now works more closely with design engineers and auto insurers -- and gets insurers involved earlier in the design process. AOL Autos: Cut your insurance in half  The goal is to identify potential repair issues and then use that info to refine designs -- which in turn helps cut the cost of repairs at dealerships and independent repair shops. Plus, this effort allows repair techs to more effectively restore the vehicles to their pre-accident condition.  To that end, engineers gather data earlier in the vehicle development process so it can be then analyzed during crash and durability testing. AOL Autos: How to choose a repair shop  For Ford, the closer integration of these functions began when the carmaker's repair and safety engineers first began collaborating on the 2009 F-150 pick-up truck.  During the vehicle's early development period, these engineers realized that new materials -- including ultra-high-strength steel and boron -- helped make the new truck safer, but also could make it more expensive to repair after a collision. AOL Autos: Minor damages, major repair costs  \"The extensive use of advanced technologies and materials in the 2009 F-150 required us to develop new, specific procedures and repair recommendations,\" said Gerry Bonanni, Ford's collision repair senior engineer.  So, Ford engineers designed and developed new front and rear-frame-section kits -- which means one single section of the frame can now be repaired / replaced after a crash, instead of having to replace the entire frame.  \"Partial-frame repairs cost at least $2,000 less than full-frame replacements,\" says Bonanni -- and will prevent some vehicles from being \"totaled,\" which would have previously been the case under repair laws in some states.  The success of the collaboration on the F-150 prompted the decision to open the new paint and body tech center. A more recent example was the work done on the 2010 Mustang.  \"Previously, we had no real procedure for sectioning off the rear-frame rails,\" says Bonanni. \"But, by collaborating with repair technicians and the insurance companies, we developed a procedure, which we then documented for the repair techs in our dealers.  \"That allows them to repair just a short section of the rear-frame rails, instead of replacing the entire frame-rail system -- which also translates into lower repair costs, and lower insurance rates, for the owner.\"  General Motors' Collision Repair Test Center has had also had recent success on this front, says Jim Doherty, GM's manager of the service-engineering team for aftersales body structures.  \"We coordinate with the product engineers, so as soon as a new vehicle starts development, about four years before it's introduced, we engage with their team,\" says Doherty.  \"Some of our people work on the structure, and some on the exterior, and we collaborate with the design engineers to work out whatever improvements might need to be made over the previous version of a component or assembly.\" AOL Autos: Best & worst auto designs  As with Ford, \"the goal is to make sure that the vehicle has the most cost-effective repair strategy,\" adds Dave Bakos, GM's director of global after-sales mechanical engineering. \"Our liaisons with people in the insurance industries are definitely useful -- they call us if they have concerns, and when we develop a new technology, we contact them to make sure they understand it.\"  The development of lighter-weight steel for auto frames also presents challenges to GM's center. \"They're very high-strength, but their repairability is more difficult when compared with the old cold-rolled steels -- so, that has forced us to come up with new welding, sectioning and attachment strategies as the vehicle is being designed and developed,\" says Doherty. AOL Autos: Take the guesswork out of buying a used car  Doherty and Bakos cite a couple of examples of how the Collision Repair Test Center -- and the collaboration between design and repair engineers and insurance companies -- have been parlayed into cost savings for car owners.  Prior to the current model year, the cost of repairing the frame-rail assembly on a Pontiac Solstice included $936 for the part itself, plus 13 \u00bd hours worth of labor costs to install, says Doherty.  But by working with design engineers and insurers, the Collision Repair Test Center was able to develop and create a \"service-only\" partial assembly. That means that, on the '09 Solstice, a collision technician can replace the damaged section of the front rail only, rather than the entire front rail section.  The parts for the partial assembly cost far less and require just three and a half hours of labor to install,\" says Doherty. \"Because of these changes, the total cost savings for this repair could be as high as $1,500.\"  The current Saturn Aura presented a challenge / opportunity along the same lines. For the '09 Aura, GM engineers at the Collision Repair Test Center created \"zone-specific\" replacement parts.  \"Rather than replacing the entire body-side assembly as a single piece, engineers developed sectioning procedures for the front, center and rear quarter sections of the vehicle,\" explains Doherty.  \"This allows the technician multiple repair options when repairing the side of a damaged vehicle. Even though the cost of parts remained similar, labor cost savings created were substantial, ranging from about $600 to as high as $1,200.\"  One current focus for these operations at Ford, GM and other carmakers relates to side-impact crashes. \"We don't want every vehicle to have to end up in the salvage yard just because a side pillar is damaged,\" says Bakos. \"So we're working on some combination of welding or welding and adhesives, or maybe mechanical fasteners, in order make those sections more repairable, so that the vehicle isn't totaled.\"  New challenges continue to present themselves, says Ford's Bonanni.  \"New technologies are developing pretty rapidly,\" he says. \"And each time a new one comes along, it's our job to develop new ways of repairing the various structures, components and parts that incorporate those new technologies -- and do it in a way that maintains the vehicle's after-crash structural integrity, and keeps costs down for the vehicle owner.\"", "Q": ["Q: What do new materials do?

{"article": "WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- A Bush administration official has publicly described a detainee's treatment at the U.S. Navy Base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, as torture, according to a published report.  The detention of terror suspects at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, has been a source of controversy.  Susan Crawford, the retired judge in charge of determining which Guantanamo detainees should be tried by a U.S. military commision, has refused to refer the case of Mohammed al-Qahtani to prosecutors because of that assessment, The Washington Post reported Wednesday.  \"We tortured (Mohammed al-) Qahtani,\" Crawford told the Post. \"His treatment met the legal definition of torture. And that's why I did not refer the case\" for prosecution.  Military prosecutors have accused al-Qahtani of helping to plan the September 11, 2001, terror attacks, and believe he may have sought to participate, possibly as the \"20th hijacker.\"  The United States had been seeking the death penalty against al-Qahtani and five other men in connection with the 9/11 attacks. Crawford approved charges against the other five.  She told the newspaper she came to her decision based on the combination of the interrogation techniques, their duration and the effect on al-Qahtani's health.  \"The techniques they used were all authorized, but the manner in which they applied them was overly aggressive and too persistent,\" she said.  \"You think of torture, you think of some horrendous physical act done to an individual. This was not any one particular act; this was just a combination of things that had a medical impact on him, that hurt his health. It was abusive and uncalled for. And coercive. Clearly coercive. It was that medical impact that pushed me over the edge\" to call it torture, she told the paper.  When asked later  Wednesday about the report, White House Press Secretary Dana Perino responded, \"It has never been the policy of this president or this administration to torture.  \"Because of command influence concerns, I have not commented about individual cases from this podium and... that's as much as I can say about it.\"  Pressed further on the issue, Perino said, \"The commander-in-chief should not be commenting on cases where the government is bringing a case against a detainee. It would be inappropriate to do so from the White House.\"  The Department of Defense issued a statement Wednesday defending the military treatment of al-Qahtani.  \"We have conducted more than a dozen investigations and reviews of our detention operations, including specifically the interrogation of al-Qahtani, the alleged 20th hijacker.  \"The investigations concluded the interrogation methods used at Gitmo (Guantanamo), including the special interrogation techniques used with Qahtani in 2002, were lawful.  \"However, subsequent to those reviews, the department adopted new and more restrictive policies, and improved oversight procedures for interrogation and detention operations.  \"Some of the aggressive questioning techniques used on al-Qahtani, although permissible at the time, are no longer allowed in the updated Army field manual.\"  In November, military prosecutors said they would try to refile charges against al-Qahtani based on later interrogations that did not use harsh techniques, the paper reported.  Crawford, who dismissed war crimes charges against al-Qahtani in May 2008, said she won't let the prosecutors pursue other charges.  His interrogation took place over 50 days -- from November 2002 to January 2003, and he was held in isolation until April 2003, she said.  \"For 160 days, his only contact was with the interrogators,\" she said.  Crawford, who studied interrogation and other military records, said al-Qahtani was forced to stand naked in front of a female agent, threatened with a military dog named Zeus, \"forced to wear a woman's bra and had a thong placed on his head\" during questioning, and \"was told that his mother and sister were whores,\" the newspaper reported.  Al-Qahtani, a Saudi national, was denied entry to the United States by an immigration officer in August 2001, and later was captured in Afghanistan. In January 2002 he was sent to Guantanamo, where he has remained in custody as an enemy combatant.  The agency said it is now focused on ensuring the proper treatment of detainees.", "Q": ["Q: What is Mohammed al-Qahtani  accused of? A:", "Q: What did the judge refuse to do?

{"article": " -- Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe has warned against outside influences in next month's run-off election, likening one American diplomat to a \"prostitute\" and threatening to oust another from his country.  Robert Mugabe tries to stir voters with a blistering speech criticizing the U.S. and Britain.  \"Zimbabwe cannot be British, it cannot be American. Yes, it is African,\" said Mugabe, whose speech Sunday was quoted Monday in The Herald, the state-run newspaper.  \"You saw the joy that the British had, that the Americans had, and saw them here through their representatives celebrating and acting as if we Zimbabwe are either an extension of Britain or... America. You saw that little American girl [U. S. Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Jendayi Frazer] trotting around the globe like a prostitute...\"  Mugabe went on to say that U.S. Ambassador to Zimbabwe James McGee would be expelled from the country if he \"persisted in meddling in Zimbabwe's electoral process,\" the newspaper reported.  The fallout from Zimbabwe's stalled election has brought international criticism, with Frazer taking the most emphatic stance. In April, Frazer accused Mugabe, who has ruled Zimbabwe for nearly three decades, of \"trying to steal the election\" and \"intimidating the population and election officials as well.\"  The first election was March 29. An announcement of the winner of the presidential election was delayed for weeks as opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai claimed he had won. The Zimbabwe Electoral Commission, after a long delay, ruled that neither candidate had won the required majority of votes, and scheduled a runoff election for June 27.  Since the March balloting, there have been numerous reports from Tsvangirai's party and church groups about kidnappings, torture and other violence, including the deaths of opposition party members. They say the violence targets opponents of Mugabe and his Zanu-PF party.  At about the same time Sunday that Mugabe was giving his campaign speech, Tsvangirai was speaking at a funeral.  Tsvangirai spoke harshly as he stood near the casket of a man he claimed was killed by Mugabe's supporters.  Watch Tsvangirai address mourners \u00bb  \"This is a clear testimony of the callousness of this regime,\" said Tsvangirai to a funeral procession of hundreds gathered outside the capital city of Harare. \"They can kill us.

{"article": "  -- Golfer Tiger Woods will \"apologize for his behavior\" Friday when he makes a statement at PGA headquarters in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida, his agent said.  Agent Mark Steinberg said Woods would not answer questions. It will be the golfer's first public appearance since his November 27 car crash outside his home near Orlando, Florida.  \"Tiger Woods will be speaking to a small group of friends, colleagues and close associates,\" Steinberg said. \"... Tiger plans to discuss his past and his future and he intends to apologize for his behavior.\"  A statement on Woods' Web site elaborated: \"While Tiger feels that what happened is fundamentally a matter between him and his wife, he also recognizes that he has hurt and let down a lot of other people who were close to him. He also let down his fans. He wants to begin the process of making amends, and that's what he's going to discuss.\"  Blog: No apologies Tiger, just be real  Steinberg said he didn't know if Woods' wife, Elin Nordegren, would appear with her husband.  Woods crashed his black Cadillac Escalade into a fire hydrant and then a tree just a few days after the National Enquirer reported he was having an affair with a New York nightclub hostess who denied the affair.  A day after he paid his $164 traffic ticket, Woods' seemingly perfect world began to crumble under what would eventually become an avalanche of allegations of infidelity threatening his five-year marriage to Nordegren.  The couple have two children, Charlie, 1, and Sam, 2.  Woods issued an apology for \"transgressions\" that had let his family down, as several women reported they had affairs with the golfer -- including one woman who allegedly had Woods on a voicemail asking her to take his name off her cell phone because \"my wife went through my phone and may be calling you.\"  Several of Woods' major sponsors, including AT&T and Accenture, ended their business relationships with Woods following the crash and the exposure of his marriage troubles.  iReport: Share your thoughts on Woods' apology  But other companies, including Nike and Pepsi's Gatorade, continue to sponsor Woods, who has taken a break from his professional golfing career.

{"article": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- Bollywood leading man Akshay Kumar plays a character who basks in the glamorous shadow cast by American stars like Sylvester Stallone and Denise Richards in his latest movie.  Akshay Kumar is one of the biggest names in Indian film.  In reality, Kumar has no need for such humility. One of the biggest names in Indian film, he's increasingly rubbing shoulders with the global glitterati these days.  In \"Kambakkht Ishq,\" he plays a Hollywood stuntman alongside Stallone and Richards, who have cameos in the film.  He starred this year with U.S. rapper Snoop Dogg in the film \"Singh is Kinng,\" and he's set to appear in a film alongside Australian pop star Kylie Minogue later in the year.  The unstoppable rise of Bollywood and the massive popularity of Indian film beyond its homeland have made stars like Kumar hot property.  The poster boy of Indian action films now finds himself at the vanguard of the crossover between the world's two largest movie industries.  Watch Kumar speak to CNN about his upcoming projects \u00bb  The Hollywood men in suits have been eyeing the Indian market greedily for some time. While the economic downturn has hit Tinseltown hard, Bollywood is a rising tiger -- the industry was worth $15 billion in 2008 and is projected to grow by 10 percent, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers.  With the notable exception of this year's runaway Oscar hit \"Slumdog Millionaire,\" attempts to make crossover films for both markets have largely failed. The masala mix of genres and exaggerated acting that typifies the Bollywood formula has met limited success in the West.  Instead Hollywood studios have begun bankrolling Bollywood productions solely for the Indian market. But the financial traffic is by no means one-way. In the other direction, Steven Spielberg's Dreamworks recently snagged a multi-million dollar film production deal with Reliance Big Entertainment, one of Bollywood's biggest hitters.  For Kumar, the strengthening of ties between Hollywood and Bollywood is bringing many opportunities, including the chance to work alongside his childhood hero Stallone. \"Well it was great. It was an honor to work with him,\" he told CNN.  In addition to starring in \"Kambakkht Ishq,\" his other major role this year was as an Indian chef who learns martial arts in \"Chandni Chowk Goes to China.\" The movie was financed by Warner Brothers. (Warner Brothers, like CNN, is owned by Time Warner.)  The typically flamboyant plot of \"Chandni Chowk\" was loosely inspired by Kumar's own life. Born in Punjab but raised in Delhi, he came to acting late after working as a waiter in Bangkok. While in the Thai capital he learned martial arts, which he taught upon his return to India before becoming a male model.  He landed his first movie role in the 1992 Hindi language film \"Deeder\" and has gone on to become one of Bollywood's leading men. He is married to fellow actor Twinkle Khanna. The couple created a buzz in India when they fell foul of the country's notoriously strict obscenity laws in March after Kumar encouraged his wife to undo the top button of his jeans at a fashion show in Mumbai. A complaint was lodged with the police and they were briefly questioned.  With more than 80 features to his name, Kumar maintains that a strong work ethic is the reason for his longevity in the movie business. \"I think it's the simplest thing. It's actually hard work and punctuality,\" the 41-year-old told CNN from the London set of his latest movie, a comedy called \"Housefull.\"  \"Even if you're not a good actor, to be a producer's actor is essential. If you finish your films on time you save money for the producer,\" he noted.  His devotion to the job is coupled with a strong sense of family duty. \"I would say my success lies at the feet of my parents because that's been my biggest strength and that's what we Hindus believe,\" he said.  \"Every morning before you go to work just touch your parents' feet and go ahead in life. People may not believe it, but I do.\"", "Q": ["Q: Which country is home to the $15 billion Bollywood industry? A:", "Q: What is the number of Bollywood movies that Kumar has appeared in?

{"article": "  -- American Lindsey Vonn suffered a pre-Olympic scare after taking a crashing fall in the World Cup giant slalom in Lienz on Monday.  Vonn, who is a medal favorite in several disciplines for February's Winter Games in Vancouver, damaged her left arm after sliding out on the first run, losing her balance on a bump after a sharp left turn before thumping into a gate.  She received lengthy medical treatment on the slope with initial fears that she had broken the arm.  But scans at a local hospital showed only severe bruising and the 25-year-old may even compete in Tuesday's slalom at the same venue, U.S. team medical director Richard Quincy told reporters.  Vonn's arm has been placed in a splint to speed recovery and she was said to have been in considerable pain.  \"Hurting my arm is way better than hurting one of my legs,\" Vonn was quoted on her personal Web site www.lindseyvonn.com.  Her crash overshadowed a fine victory for Kathrin Hoelzl of Germany, who led after the first run and posted a combined time of  two minutes, 16.61 seconds with Manuela Moelgg of Italy just 0.05 seconds back in second.  Taina Barioz of France occupied the final podium position.  Vonn retains her lead in the overall standings with 581 points ahead of second-placed Maria Reisch, who appeared distracted by her friend's crash and also skied out first time down.  The German is 50 points adrift as Vonn looks to defend her overall crown.  Vonn suffered an unusual injury setback at the world championships in Val d'Isere, France earlier this year.  Celebrating a medal success, she sliced her thumb open on a champagne bottle and competed for the rest of the season with heavy strapping.  Vonn's appearance in Vancouver is being heavily plugged by sponsors and television rights holders, but she is still seeking her first Olympic medal after missing out in Salt Lake City and Turin.  Austria's Kathrin Zettel, who led the GS standings going into the race but was overtaken by Hoelzl, was 0.95 seconds behind the German after skiing off-course in her first run and finished fifth.

{"article": "Palm Beach, Florida (CNN) -- For years, Army veteran Roy Foster's motto has been \"No man left behind.\" This month, he's broadened it to include women.  In November, Foster was recognized at \"CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute\" as a Top 10 CNN Hero of 2009 for his efforts to help male veterans struggling with homelessness and addiction. His nonprofit, Faith*Hope*Love*Charity, has provided food, housing, counseling, employment and medical services to more than 1,100 veterans.  \"I was somewhat overwhelmed at the tribute. To be a part of something that you love doing -- to be honored in doing it was, you know, strange,\" recalled Foster, 54. \"But then to be showcased internationally was tremendous. And it's still reaping benefits today.\"  Among those benefits is Foster's recent opening of the First Stop Resource Center and Housing Program in Palm Beach, Florida. The center and program widen the scope of support services his organization has been offering through its original Stand Down House. They also bring Foster's long-held dream to fruition.  \"Twenty years ago, the dream was to be able to provide assistance and services for homeless veterans and their entire family,\" he said. \"We did come up with Stand Down House 10 years ago, but there was never that support for the family or the female veterans. This year, we've been fortunate enough to complete that vision.\"  Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2010 CNN Heroes  The First Stop Resource Center assists veterans and their families through various periods of crises, including homelessness and addiction. Before its addition, Foster and his team had to send veterans in need from one partner aid agency to another over multiple days, in multiple locations -- increasing the risk of losing clients back to the streets.  At the new resource center, veterans in need are able to meet with any of First Stop's 15 community aid partners under one roof in a single visit. They can receive assistance with housing, legal, medical care, employment, child care, education, pensions, food stamps and transportation needs.  \"We were looking to establish a place where we will not lose them in that process of 'hurry up and wait,' \" Foster said. \"We want to centralize it. We want to get their needs addressed and... get these service members back out into the community. That's what it's about.\"  First Stop's housing program is geared toward female veterans and veterans with children. Set adjacent to the organization's original Stand Down House for male veterans, the two new residence buildings can provide temporary housing for up to eight single female veterans and two small families. It is only the second transitional housing facility in the nation available to veterans with children, according to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.  \"We're trying to empower the family structure, because if the family struggles, the soldier struggles. When the soldier struggles, it puts everyone at risk,\" Foster said.  Barbara Williams is First Stop's first female resident. An Operation Desert Storm veteran, Williams fell on hard times after losing her job last year. Now, she and her daughters have a roof over their heads and the hope of better days to come.  \"My pride is restored,\" said Williams, 40. \"I'm able to just go off to look for jobs and not worry about where am I going to go when I come home. It's just so much relief.\"  The seed money for the new housing facility arrived shortly after Foster was announced as a Top 10 CNN Hero. A local veteran and recovering addict who was touched by Foster's story approached him with a donation that covered the first year's housing budget, about $44,000. The furnishings were donated by a local veterans' motorcycle club.  \"Believe it, there are people in America that do care, and we were blessed to come across these individuals,\" Foster said. \"And the thing that I appreciate the most is it is done for veterans by veterans.... We are going to leave no man, or woman or family behind.\"  Want to get involved?

{"article": " -- Four months after he was escorted in his pajamas onto a military plane and flown out of the country, ousted Honduran President Jose Manuel Zelaya could return to power within days, analysts said Friday.  Negotiators for Zelaya and Roberto Micheletti, the politician who was appointed president hours after Zelaya's June 28 removal, reached an agreement late Thursday to form a government of national reconciliation. The nation's congress, in consultation with the supreme court, must approve Zelaya's return to power.  The reconciliation government would rule until a new president, to be chosen in November 29 elections, takes office in January.  Micheletti announced the agreement in a televised speech to the nation Thursday night.  Zelaya said Friday his return to the presidency is \"imminent\" and should occur within days. He has been staying at the Brazilian Embassy in Tegucigalpa, the Honduran capital, since secretly returning to the country September 21.  \"At this moment we are trying to reach a consensus so we can reconstruct democracy,\" he told CNN en Espa\u00f1ol on Friday.  Although Zelaya's return to the presidency is not guaranteed in the eight-point pact, several analysts say they expect the congress will approve the measure.  \"If Micheletti came forward with a public announcement, the odds of this being approved by congress are pretty good. It's a done deal,\" said Kevin Casas-Zamora, a senior foreign policy fellow at the non-partisan Brookings Institution and a former vice president of Costa Rica. \"It would be a horrible letdown if congress did not approve the agreement.\"  Peter Hakim, president of the Inter-American Dialogue policy institute, also believes \"they'll go ahead and vote for it.\"  Said Larry Birns, director of the liberal Council on Hemispheric Affairs: \"There seems to be no other way.\"  The United States played a key role in the accord after weeks of stalemate. Thomas Shannon, assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs, and two other high-level U.S. officials arrived Wednesday and met separately with Zelaya and Micheletti. An agreement appeared possible Thursday when Shannon announced at a news conference that the U.S. delegation would stay another day.  A delegation from the Organization of American States had visited Honduras in early October but failed to obtain an agreement. Costa Rican President Oscar Arias had held consultations with both sides but did not get them to agree on a solution.  The OAS, the United Nations, the European Union and the United States condemned the military-backed coup and demanded that Zelaya be reinstated. The United States and others imposed economic sanctions, which some analysts say have started to hurt Honduras.  \"The dark secret here is that the Honduran economy has been devastated,\" Birns said. \"Huge numbers of Hondurans have crossed over into Mexico and are desperate for jobs.\"  Crumbling economic conditions left Micheletti little choice, Birns said.  \"All along Micheletti was holding a diminishing deck,\" he said. \"Not only the poor were being hurt. The cutoffs were hurting the nation's economic elite. So there was a very strong economic motive to reach a solution.\"  There also was a strong political motive, Hakim said.  \"The candidates for president, the people looking forward, wanted to see the elections on November 29 as being legitimate,\" he said.  Birns agreed that \"the candidates wanted a resolution because of legitimacy.\"  The United States and many other nations had said the elections would be considered illegitimate if held under Micheletti's rule.  \"By far, the most important thing right now is not whether Zelaya will be reinstated, but that the U.S. is going to recognize the elections,\" said Heather Berkman, a Latin America analyst with the Eurasia Group consulting firm.  \"The next president will be able to receive diplomatic recognition and much-needed access to international aid and financing, which will be crucial given the weakness of the economy and the fact that the government is running out of money,\" she said.  Zelaya also appeared to have little choice but to accept the pact, even though it does not automatically return to him to power, as he had demanded all along.  \"He didn't have many options, did he?\" said Casas-Zamora of the Brookings Institution. \"He was never able to mobilize people in the numbers he claimed to have. He didn't have much clout, frankly. Holed up in the Brazilian Embassy he became much more marginalized. That's as good as it gets for him.\"  The president's four-year term -- whether it's Zelaya or Micheletti -- ends January 27, when the new head of state will take over.  Berkman believes Zelaya heard the clock ticking.  \"Zelaya probably accepted this agreement because he was running out of time and leverage, and he may have thought that going through congress was his best bet at getting an agreement in his favor,\" she said.  Birns sees it as a face-saving move.  \"The only thing Zelaya gets out of this is the dignity of serving out his complete term,\" Birns said. \"He will be a president without any authority. Basically, he's been rendered into a figurehead president.\"  In addition to the formation of a reconciliation government, the pact also stipulates -- at Zelaya's insistence -- that there will be no amnesty for those involved in his ouster.  Micheletti said in an interview Friday evening with CNN en Espa\u00f1ol that he's certain Zelaya will try to prosecute him. Just a few weeks ago, it was Micheletti who was saying Zelaya would be prosecuted if he left the Brazilian Embassy.  \"Yes, we are certain that there will be persecution,\" Micheletti said Friday. \"But I am not afraid. What we did was within the constitution.\"  Micheletti has insisted Zelaya was removed through constitutional means, not a coup.  Some analysts say legal proceedings might not be the best course.  \"Any attempt to seek revenge here is going to be costly and inefficient and conflictive,\" said Birns, head of the Council on Hemispheric Affairs.  The pact also calls for the creation of a \"truth commission\" to investigate the events surrounding Zelaya's ouster; the formation of a \"verification commission\" to ensure that the agreement is adhered to; and a solicitation to the international community to lift economic and diplomatic sanctions.  The political crisis stemmed from Zelaya's plan to hold a referendum that could have changed the constitution to allow longer terms for the president. The country's congress had outlawed the vote and the supreme court had ruled it illegal.  Zelaya has said since his ouster he would not try to revive the issue if returned to power. That's a good thing, Hakim said.  \"The most important thing,\" he said, \"are the assurances that Zelaya will be limited in his powers.\"", "Q": ["Q: What has planned the Zelaya's referendum?

{"article": "Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- Turn back time, more than 90 years, to a cold case that won't gather dust.  It's a classic whodunit, starting with the rape and murder of a 13-year-old girl and ending in a lynching. It was grist for a prosecutor's political aspirations, a case that was appealed all the way to the country's highest court and a story hotly debated in the national press.  At the center of it all was Leo Frank, a northern Jew who'd moved to Atlanta to supervise the National Pencil Company factory. When the body of Mary Phagan, a white child laborer, was found in the basement, law enforcement homed in on Frank. He was tried and convicted, based on what most historians say was the perjured testimony of a black man, and sentenced to death. But when the governor commuted his sentence in 1915, about 25 men abducted Frank, 31, from the state prison and hung him from a tree in Marietta, Georgia.  Considered one of the most sensational trials of the early 20th century, the Frank case seemed to press every hot-button issue of the time: North vs. South, black vs. white, Jew vs. Christian, industrial vs. agrarian.  In the years since, it has inspired numerous books and films, TV programs, plays, musicals and songs. It has fueled legal discussions, spawned a traveling exhibition and driven public forums.  Who murdered Mary Phagan? What forces were behind the lynching of Frank? Why should we still care?  Answers to these questions, or theories, keep coming.  \"Leo Frank was not a good ole Southern boy. He was different and not ashamed of being different,\" said Ben Loeterman, whose new documentary, \"The People v. Leo Frank,\" will air Monday on PBS. \"The test of us as a society is not necessarily how we treat the best among us but how we treat the most questionable.\"  Mixed in with ongoing analysis of the Phagan-Frank story are the descendants of those involved, people who learned of their connections differently and carry these legacies forward in unique ways.  The accused  \"The story goes that no one in my family talked about it,\" said Cathee Smithline, a 62-year-old great-niece of Frank.  Frank was the one who handed Mary Phagan her check when she stopped by the factory on April 26, 1913, Confederate Memorial Day. The night watchman, Newt Lee, would find the body and call police early the next day.  Smithline, of Wyckoff, New Jersey, was 16 when she first heard about the case. Her mother sat her down, told her a story about what a man in the South had been through, said it was based on her uncle and handed over a book: \"A Little Girl is Dead.\"  It turns out Smithline's mother got the news in her teens, too, when her boyfriend turned to her after seeing \"They Won't Forget,\" a 1937 Hollywood film. \"You know that's about your uncle,\" he said.  She'd grown up hearing Uncle Leo died of pneumonia, and after asking family about it, the truth was revealed, followed by the words, \"We will never talk about this again,\" Smithline said.  \"I think it was a family embarrassment,\" she said. \"My grandmother [who died when Smithline was 1] was very close to her brother. It cannot be easy to tell someone your brother was lynched and why.\"  The first victim  Mary Phagan Kean was 13 when the story hit her. She was in a South Carolina classroom, and her name stopped short a teacher taking attendance.  \"Mary Phagan, you say?\" she recalled the teacher asking, peering up from his list. He wanted to know if she was related to a girl with that name who died in 1913. Confidently, she told him she wasn't. But the boys on the playground taunted her anyway, telling her she was reincarnated from a dead girl.  Traumatized, she asked her father about her name. \"He turned whiter than white,\" she remembered.  Mary Phagan had been her grandfather's little sister. He only wept when asked about her. When Mary Phagan Kean's family moved back to Marietta, questions about that name never stopped.  \"I went on a campaign,\" said Kean, 55, who sought out every article and piece of information she could find. \"I did that for years and years and years.\"  The consensus of historians is that the Frank case was a miscarriage of justice. Crime scene evidence was destroyed, they say. A bloody hand print was not analyzed. Transcripts from the trial vanished.  Frank's conviction was based largely on the testimony of a janitor, Jim Conley, who most came to see as Phagan's killer. He'd written notes found with the body, but said they were dictated to him. The prosecutor, Hugh Dorsey, used race in his argument, saying a black man couldn't be smart enough to come up with such stories.  Witnesses would come forward to say Conley was seen carrying the body and washing out a bloody shirt. Conley's own attorney, William Smith, came to believe in Frank's innocence, scrawling a note to that effect on his death bed nearly 35 years later.  Conley, who appeared in the press for petty crimes over the years, eventually disappeared.  Dorsey, the prosecutor, had political aspirations riding on this win.  \"A conviction of just another black guy wasn't going to do anything for his career,\" said Sandy Berman, the archivist at The William Breman Jewish Heritage Museum in Atlanta who created the traveling exhibit, \"Seeking Justice: The Leo Frank Case Revisited.\"  Two years after Frank's lynching, Dorsey was elected governor of Georgia.  But the story was interpreted differently by Kean, who wrote \"The Murder of Little Mary Phagan,\" and stands by this conclusion: \"Leo Frank was guilty as sin. He was a sexual pervert.\"  Kean often visits her namesake's grave in Marietta. She's not the only one. She says she's struck by the teddy bears people leave there.  The governor  Elizabeth Slaton Wallace couldn't be prouder of her heritage. At 81, she's the great-niece of the late Georgia Gov. John M. Slaton, the man who commuted Frank's death sentence to a life sentence, believing Frank's innocence would be proved and, in doing so, ruined his political career.  The Georgia National Guard was called out to protect the governor after his decision prompted a rabble-rousing newspaper publisher to call for the lynching of both Frank and Slaton.  Frank had been moved to the state prison in Milledgeville, Georgia, where an inmate slashed his throat. He survived, but weeks later about two dozen Marietta men came into the prison, with no resistance from officials, and abducted Frank in the dark of night.  By dawn, he was hanging from a tree in Marietta. Photographs of his dangling body and the crowds who gathered there adorned souvenir postcards.  \"Leo Frank was a Jew and a Yankee Jew at that. He was railroaded. Uncle Jack knew that,\" said Wallace, who lives in Atlanta.  She can't explain why the story persists to this day. But throughout her life she's witnessed the kindness of the Jewish community, especially toward her father, who was named for the late governor.  \"The Jewish community could never do enough for my father,\" said Wallace, who recalled being in a Jewish-owned store with her parents in the 1980s. \"They could have given us the shop.\"  As grateful as they were to Slaton, Frank's lynching left Georgia's small Jewish community frightened. Many left the state; those who stayed kept a low profile. For decades, they only spoke of Frank in hushed tones.  The lynching party  The lynching of a white man can hardly be compared to what happened in the black community in the South. But this case, the only lynching of a Jew on American soil, was the culmination of a state-sponsored conspiracy, historians say.  While Georgia Jews remained quiet, so did those who were involved in Frank's killing, said Steve Oney of Los Angeles, California, who wrote the authoritative book \"And the Dead Shall Rise: The Murder of Mary Phagan and the Lynching of Leo Frank.\" It would be about 80 years before members of the lynching party were publicly, and not just secretly, known.  \"They were not liquored-up yahoos,\" said Oney, a journalist, editor and Atlanta native who spent 17 years researching his book. \"These were smart, deliberate people -- from good, prominent families.\"  They included a former governor, a former mayor, a U.S. senator's son, a judge, lawyers, a state legislator and business owners. One of the 25 or so men was Cicero Dobbs, the grandfather-in-law of Roy Barnes, a Georgia lawyer and politician who is a former governor himself and will be running again in 2010.  Barnes and his wife, Marie, never knew Dobbs, who owned a taxi company in Marietta and likely provided transportation to the prison where Frank was held. Oney broke the news about the family connection to them.  \"Marie's parents didn't know. It was never mentioned,\" Barnes said. \"On death beds, people confessed. It was just that powerful.\"  Barnes, who is featured in the new documentary, said it's important to keep the story alive and learn from it.  \"It's a terrible blot on our history,\" he said. \"How we keep it from happening again is to never forget.\"", "Q": ["Q: Of whom did the mob consist?

{"article": "THE EVERGLADES, Florida (CNN) -- Joe Wasilewski drives along a narrow stretch of road through Florida's Everglades. The sun is setting, night is coming on quickly, and Wasilewski is on the prowl for snakes -- and one snake in particular.  Reptile expert Joe Wasilewski holds a Burmese python he found in the Florida Everglades.  \"The next 10 miles seem to be the hot spot for Burmese pythons,\" he said.  Wasilewski is a state-sanctioned snake-hunter who regularly scours this area for the reptiles. The Everglades, known as the River of Grass, has the perfect space and climate for pythons to hide and breed.  And breed they do: The largest clutches found in the Everglades have contained 83 eggs.  They are also speedy travelers, able to move across 1.6 miles of land every day, experts say.  The travel lets people like Wasilewski hunt the snakes from the driver's seat of his truck. But it also means that the problems created in the local ecosystem by the non-venomous snakes are spreading.  \"It's a large predator, and they're eating basically everything in sight. That's the problem,\" Wasilewski said of the Burmese python.  Volunteers like Wasilewski, happy to grasp the problem and the snakes with both hands, are not the only troops in Florida's war on the invading pythons.  A \"Python Patrol\" was launched in the Florida Keys, south of the Everglades, by Alison Higgins of the Nature Conservancy. Her program uses utility workers, wildlife officials, park rangers and police to keep an eye out for snakes and trains them to capture any they find.  \"The Burmese pythons that are coming out of the Everglades are eating a lot of our endangered species and other creatures, and we want to make sure they don't breed here,\" said Higgins, the conservation manager for the Keys.  It is believed that the problem originated when reptile-breeding facilities near the Everglades were destroyed during Hurricane Andrew. Compounding the problem is the release of these snakes by pet owners.  \"These pets were released by owners that do not understand the threat to the ecosystem,\" Everglades National Park spokeswoman Linda Friar said. She said the pets, which can grow to 200 pounds and live for 30 years, often get too big for owners to handle.  The state has a pilot program with several volunteer snake hunters such as Wasilewski.  Twenty years ago, no Burmese pythons were found in the Everglades, park statistics say. Now, there could be 100,000 snakes in the River of Grass, but no one knows for sure.  What Wasilewski, an expert on reptiles, is sure of is that night is the best time for his hunting, as that is when the snakes tend to be on the move.  When he finds his prey, he puts the snake in a bag, deposits it in a crate and delivers it to biologists for the Everglades National Park, where the snake can be studied and/or destroyed.  On one recent evening, the pickings were slim, and after two hours of driving back and forth along the two-lane Tamiami Trail, Wasilewski's crate was empty. He saw a python on the road, but it was dead, and the other small snakes and a baby alligator in the area did not interest him.  Finally, Wasilewski, an environmental and wildlife consultant, spotted something. \"Yeah, baby! Hee ha! Look at the size of this one,\" he exclaimed from the front seat of his truck.  He got out and picked up the brownish-green snake, which immediately coiled around his arm.  \"This isn't a big one,\" he said, but as he got a closer look, he did not deny that it was a good one: \"At least 12 [feet.]\"  Wasilewski has a soft spot for these species, and one of the reasons he volunteers for the snake hunt is to learn more about them.  He says it is not the snakes' fault that they ended up in the Everglades, but he acknowledges the problems they are causing on the Florida ecosystem and the need to do something.  \"One down, 100,000 to go,\" he said.", "Q": ["Q: How many in numbers are there A:", "Q: What breeds quickly and travels quickly?

{"article": "WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The nation's largest publicly owned utility company may be vulnerable to cyber attacks, according to a new report.  In 2007 President Bush visited the Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant, operated by the Tennessee Valley Authority.  The Tennessee Valley Authority, which supplies power to almost 9 million Americans, \"has not fully implemented appropriate security practices to protect the control systems used to operate its critical infrastructures,\" leaving them \"vulnerable to disruption,\" the Government Accountability Office found.  Simply put, that means a skilled hacker could disrupt the system and cause a blackout.  Rep. James Langevin, a Rhode Island Democrat, fears the problem is much larger than just the TVA.  \"If they are not secure, I don't have a great deal of confidence that the rest of our critical infrastructure on the electric grid is secure,\" he said.  The TVA operates 52 nuclear, hydroelectric and fossil-fuel facilities in the southeastern United States.  Among the government watchdog agency findings:  \u2022 The TVA's firewalls have been bypassed or are inadequately configured  \u2022 Passwords are not effective  \u2022 Servers and work stations lack key patches and effective virus protection  \u2022 Intrusion-detection systems are not adequate  \u2022 Some locations lack enough physical security around control systems.  The GAO recommends 73 steps to correct the problems in its report to Congress.  In September, CNN first aired dramatic footage of a government experiment demonstrating that a cyber attack could destroy electrical equipment.  The experiment, dubbed \"Aurora,\" caused a generator to fall apart and grind to a halt after a computer attack on its control system. The test was conducted by scientists at the Idaho National Laboratory.  In October, the North American Electric Reliability Corp. told Congress that 75 percent of utilities had taken steps to mitigate the Aurora vulnerability, but Langevin said it now appears that Congress was misled.  A congressional audit of the electric reliability corporation's claim cast doubt on the assertion that most utilities were taking steps to fix the problem.  \"It appears that they just made those numbers up,\" Langevin said. \"It is not acceptable. It is outrageous.\"  He said the result is there is now no clear picture of how vulnerable utilities are to cyber attacks.  The electric reliability corporation -- a nongovernmental group that oversees the power system and comprises members of the industry and some consumers -- told CNN it regrets the confusion.  Experts told CNN that Cooper Industries is the only manufacturer of hardware that can close the Aurora vulnerability. The company estimated it would need to sell about 10,000 devices to fix the problem nationwide. It has sold just over 100, it told CNN.  Langevin said the federal government may need new powers to require utilities to take corrective actions to close cyber security gaps, and he will press to give those powers to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.  The congressman is chairing an Emerging Threats, Cybersecurity, and Science and Technology subcommittee hearing Wednesday afternoon.  Representatives of the TVA, the GAO, the federal commission and the electric reliability corporation are to appear before the subcommittee.", "Q": ["Q: Who can disrupt the Tennessee Valley Authority?

{"article": " -- The father of Haleigh Cummings, a Florida girl who disappeared in February, plans to file for divorce from the girl's stepmother, a key witness in the case, his attorneys told HLN's \"Nancy Grace.\"  Ronald Cummings plans to divorce his wife, Misty, his attorney says.  The move follows weeks of reported tension between Ronald and Misty Cummings during the search for Haleigh, who was 5 when last seen.  In papers expected to be filed Tuesday, Ronald Cummings, 25, cites irreconcilable differences in ending his short marriage to his 17-year-old wife, said Terry Shoemaker, Ronald Cummings' attorney.  Haleigh went missing from her father's home in Satsuma, Florida, on February 9. Cummings has made several public pleas for information in her disappearance.  Misty Cummings, then known as Misty Croslin, was the last person known to have seen Haleigh the night she disappeared from the family's rented mobile home. The teenager said she tucked Haleigh and her 4-year-old brother into bed about 8 p.m. and went to sleep herself two hours later, but awoke at 3 a.m. to find the girl missing and a cinder block propping open a back door.  Ronald Cummings called police and reported his daughter missing when he returned from work at dawn.  Investigators have said they do not feel Misty Cummings has told them everything she knows.  \"The police have been telling me that I've been keeping Misty under my wing and that's why she hasn't talked to the cops,\" Ronald Cummings told a \"Nancy Grace\" producer Tuesday. \"So now, here you go, I divorced her. So now go find my baby.\"  Watch Ronald Cummings speak to Nancy Grace \u00bb  The Putnam County Sheriff's office said in August that \"the evidence and investigatory effort has minimized the likelihood that Haleigh's disappearance is the work of a stranger.\" Ronald Cummings and Crystal Sheffield, Haleigh's mother, are not considered suspects, police said.  \"Investigators believe that Misty Croslin-Cummings continues to hold important answers in the case,\" the sheriff's office said in a written statement. \"She has failed to provide any sort of detailed accounting of the hours during the late evening and early morning of Haleigh's disappearance. Furthermore, physical evidence at the scene contradicts Misty's sketchy account of her evening activities.\" Shoemaker said his client told Misty Cummings he wanted a divorce on Sunday, and that the a divorce agreement was drawn up Monday. The agreement was sent to Misty Cummings' lawyer for her signature.  \"He really didn't come to us and say, 'I want to file for divorce,'\" said another of Ronald Cummings' attorneys, Brandon Beardsley. \"My understanding is that this is something that he and Misty have been discussing for the last few days and they're contemplating it because they ultimately feel that it is in the best interest for both of them.\"  Misty Cummings' attorney, Robert Fields, told CNN he has not talked with his client and doesn't know her thoughts regarding the divorce. Fields said he had received the papers via e-mail but had not had a chance to review them. Asked what he thought the divorce would mean for the search for Haleigh, he said, \"Probably nothing.\"  \"You have to understand that ever since Haleigh went missing, they have been scrutinized,\" Beardsley said of the Cummingses. \"They can't go out to dinner, can't even go to the convenience store to get a drink.... The pressure of everything that is going on, the allegations and speculation, has been a stress on the relationship.  The two lived together for about six months before marrying in March. The divorce agreement provides no financial terms, according to Shoemaker.

{"article": "COLUMBIA, South Carolina (CNN)  -- South Carolina Republican Party Chairwoman Karen Floyd seemed to suggest Wednesday that the time had come for GOP Gov. Mark Sanford to consider resigning from office.  Gov. Mark Sanford has said it's better for him to keep his governorship to \"learn lessons.\"  \"For the past two days, I have been speaking with Republican leaders across South Carolina,\" she said in a statement. \"There is clearly a growing view that the time may have come for Governor Sanford to remove himself and his family from the limelight, so that he can devote his efforts full-time to repairing the damage in his personal life.\"  The statement comes on the same day as a growing number of GOP state senators called for Sanford to step down.  CNN has learned that GOP Sens. Daniel Verdin, Shane Martin, Ronnie Cromer and Wes Hayes joined the anti-Sanford chorus Wednesday morning, bringing the total number of Republican senators calling for the governor's resignation to 13. There are 27 Republicans in the state Senate.  Another state senator stopped just short of calling for Sanford to step down Wednesday. Glenn McConnell, Senate president pro tempore, didn't explicitly ask Sanford to resign, but he did ask him \"to do the right thing for himself, his family and our state.\"  Sanford and his staff have said repeatedly this week that he will not resign. He wrote in a message to his political action committee e-mail list Monday that while he considered resigning, \"I would ultimately be a better person and of more service in whatever doors God opened next in life if I stuck around to learn lessons rather than running and hiding down at the farm.\"  After returning last week from a secret trip to Argentina that his staff and wife didn't know about, Sanford admitted to an extramarital affair with a woman identified as Maria Belen Chapur. Sanford also told The Associated Press on Tuesday that he's \"crossed lines\" with other women, although Chapur was the only one he had sex with.  Watch a report on Sanford's situation \u00bb  Sanford's support among legislators and grassroots leaders in the state eroded considerably Tuesday after Sanford told The Associated Press he had met with his mistress more times than he had previously disclosed. He also admitted to dalliances with other women.  At least four county GOP chairmen have also called for Sanford to go.  Glenn McCall, the York County Republican Party chairman who has been leading a grassroots effort against the governor, said Wednesday that he and other conservative activists are postponing a rally at the State House next week because legislators are starting to come out strongly against Sanford.  The rally had been scheduled to pressure Senate and House leaders to call for Sanford's resignation and start an investigation into his activities. But now that officials are publicly coming out against the governor and Attorney General Henry McMaster has begun investigating Sanford's travel records, McCall said the rally may not be necessary.  \"We are hoping that legislators can quietly, in private talks with the governor, ask him if he would please step down,\" McCall said.  A top South Carolina Democrat also called for Sanford's resignation Wednesday. \"While I believe an investigation should still be done to determine the full extent of Mark Sanford's abuse of power, [through] his long stream of confessions he has already revealed enough immoral and reprehensible behavior to justify asking him to step [down],\" state Democratic Party Chairwoman Carol Fowler said in a statement.  \"State officials seem unable to do anything except worry and talk about Governor Sanford's extramarital affair, which we learn more about every few hours.  \"... South Carolina can't afford to be at a standstill for the next 18 months with a governor who ignores his job responsibilities while pursuing personal interests,\" the statement said. \"Any other worker in South Carolina would be fired for not showing up at work with no notice.\"  Late Tuesday, seven GOP senators, including Majority Leader Harvey Peeler, jointly issued a letter demanding that the governor step down because he has lost the trust of South Carolinians.  \"The bottom line is that the Governor's private matters should remain private, but his deception and negligence make it impossible for us to trust him, and for him to govern in the future,\" they wrote.  Peeler told CNN that Sanford \"has lost his ability to lead, and I'm afraid he has lost his ability to function as a man.\"  \"He is sitting all alone in that big governor's mansion, totally alone,\" Peeler said. \"It's about leadership and moving forward and it's time for him to resign.\"  Peeler issued the statement along with Sens. Hugh Leatherman, Paul Campbell, Thomas Alexander, Jake Knotts, Larry Martin and William O'Dell.  Earlier Tuesday, two of Sanford's top conservative allies in the senate -- Larry Grooms and Kevin Bryant -- also said Sanford must go.  The Greenville News, one of the largest papers in South Carolina, also issued a sharply worded editorial Wednesday telling Sanford to go. It wrote that Sanford has \"acted like a heart-sick school boy, and he's revealed facts that clearly demonstrate he is capable of exceptional deception, arrogance and narcissism.\"  The State, of Columbia, South Carolina's largest paper, editorialized earlier that he should remain in office.  Watch a reporter from The State comment on the situation \u00bb  The attorney general of South Carolina asked the State Law Enforcement Division to review Sanford's travel records after the governor admitted Tuesday to more visits with his mistress than previously disclosed.  The review by law enforcement officials would be the first formal investigation into whether Sanford abused his power while carrying on his affair.  State Law Enforcement Division Chief Reggie Lloyd said he would not characterize the review as a criminal investigation.  He told reporters on a conference call that law enforcement officials are reviewing documents from the governor's office going back to 2003, when Sanford came to power. He said the review should be concluded by the end of the week.  Attorney General Henry McMaster, a Republican, had been reluctant to move forward with calls for an investigation into Sanford, saying he is wary of mixing legal matters with political score-settling from longtime Sanford opponents. However, an aide to McMaster told CNN on Tuesday that \"that all changed this morning when the governor disclosed additional trips that were not disclosed last week.\"  Sanford said in a statement Tuesday that he's \"pleased that [the State Law Enforcement Division] will look into this matter.\"  \"There's been a lot of speculation and innuendo on whether or not public moneys were used to advance my admitted unfaithfulness.

In Germany, consumers have junked more than 1.2 million guzzlers in the last five months and significantly boosted the economy there. So we know that Clunkers programs get the job done. How many other government programs can you say that about?  The Senate has joined the House in passing an additional $2 billion for Cash for Clunkers, allowing the program to move forward. This will bring additional buyers to the showroom. One key feature of the Clunkers program is that it is not just $3 billion of new money into the economy. It is injecting $21 billion -- since consumers must bring the rest of the money to pay for the new car. That is a lot of stimulus for the dollar.  Cash for Clunkers is saving jobs up and down the auto supply chain: from dealers to assembly workers and parts markers. Dealerships alone lost 50,000 jobs in the last 18 months and would continue to shed jobs without this program.  If you look at the new cars consumers are buying with the program, 45 percent are from Detroit's Big Three automakers. That is a lot of new sales for Ford, GM and Chrysler.  Cash for Clunkers also helps autoworkers across the country. Let's remember that lots of the Toyotas and Hondas sold in the program are made by American workers right here in this country. They are in states such as Kentucky, Tennessee and Alabama. This program helps all American autoworkers, not just those up North.  Some people ask why we should help the auto industry and not other industries in this same way. Cash for Clunkers actually helps all of us -- even those of us who do not participate in the program or work in the auto industry.  First, the auto industry has so many connected jobs in real estate, finance, manufacturing and other industries, that is hard to separate it out.  Second, one of the biggest drags on our economy is our trade imbalance. We import about $700 billion more than we export. That hurts our capital flows, credit and other key indicators.  Guess what amounts to 50 percent of that trade imbalance? Oil. We use 21 million barrels of oil every day in the United States and import 62 percent of that -- mainly from countries that really don't like us. We use that oil mainly for transportation -- cars, SUVs, and other vehicles.  Unless we scrap guzzlers at a faster rate, we will never reduce our oil consumption. Cash for Clunkers is a step in the right direction. It educates the consumer on how much they are paying for having a low-MPG car and encourages them to get into a more efficient vehicle.  A family can save $750-$1,000 a year by jumping just 10 mpg in efficiency. Those savings will increase as gas prices go back up. Gas has already shot up from $1.50 a gallon to $2.60. Do you want to be stuck with a 10 mile-per-gallon guzzler when gas jumps back to $4 a gallon?  Third, Cash for Clunkers saves lives. When you bring in a clunker that has no airbags, anti-lock brakes or other modern safety features and get a new car that does, you are protecting your family. Forty thousand people die every year on American highways and many more get serious injuries.  You can reduce your chances of becoming a statistic by getting the most safety for your dollar -- and with the Clunkers program you can now do that more affordably.  As a co-architect of the federal Cash for Clunkers program with the Center for American Progress and the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy and adviser to various congressional offices on the issue, it is gratifying to see how quickly it has been adopted by the American people. It achieves multiple goals -- it stimulates auto sales, increases the efficiency of the U.S. fleet and makes us safer.  Let's support this program by encouraging our friends and neighbors to finally retire that guzzler and help the country with the purchase of a cleaner, lower maintenance car for the future.

{"article": "Los Angeles (CNN) -- Tipsters are coming forward with additional information regarding actress Natalie Wood's 1981 drowning death, after authorities announced two months ago they were reopening the case, a Los Angeles County sheriff's spokesman said Wednesday.  \"After the presser, we got a number of calls, and those calls were intriguing, and we're chasing those down now,\" said spokesman Steve Whitmore.  Meanwhile, investigators have yet to re-interview a key witness -- Dennis Davern, the captain of yacht owned by Wood and her then-husband, actor Robert Wagner. Davern offered a new account in November about how Wood's death was reported, saying that Wagner waited hours to call the Coast Guard after Wood went missing off Catalina Island, near the California coast, following an argument the couple had.  Whitmore declined to reveal whether detectives plan to talk with Davern, saying he would \"not get into the specifics\" of the investigation.  Investigators haven't re-interviewed Wagner either. Authorities have no plans to question the actor at this time, but \"who knows where things may go from here tomorrow,\" Whitmore said.  \"The investigation is not closed. It's possible we could yield new information that changes this case,\" the sheriff's spokesman said. \"There are leads we're following up on and have to close them out before we say anything definitive. Sure, there is possible new information that could come out that really changes everything.\"  In November, homicide investigators decided to take a new look at one of Hollywood's most enduring mysteries after they were contacted by people who claimed they had additional information about the actress' drowning, the sheriff's department said.  \"This new information is substantial enough to make us want to take a new look at the case,\" Lt. John Corina said at the time.  Corina declined to comment directly on statements made by Davern to some media outlets.  When asked if the captain could face charges for possibly lying to authorities during the 1981 investigation, Corina responded: \"That, I can't say. We'll probably end up talking to the captain sooner or later, and we'll assess what he has to say then and now.\"  Authorities haven't gone into specifics about who they've interviewed, but did say when they reopened the case that Wagner wasn't a suspect.  Wood drowned in the Pacific Ocean on November 29, 1981, off the isthmus of Catalina Island. She once said in a televised interview that her greatest fear was of dark seawater.  Her body was found floating in the water about a mile away from the yacht, wearing a long nightgown, socks, and a down jacket, according to police reports.  The autopsy report showed the actress had two dozen bruises on her body, including a facial abrasion on her left cheek and bruises on her arms.  \"My sister was not a swimmer and did not know how to swim, and she would never go to another boat or to shore dressed in a nightgown and socks,\" said Lana Wood, refering to theories that the actress voluntarily jumped from the boat.  Although the county coroner's office ruled that Wood's death was an accident, others say the case hasn't made sense.  In 2010, Lana Wood told CNN she believes a highly charged argument between her sister and Wagner on the yacht's back deck preceded Wood's drowning. She told CNN last year she does not suspect foul play.  \"I just want the truth to come out, the real story,\" she said.  Davern, the former captain of the yacht Splendour, broke his long silence with a detailed account of that day in \"Goodbye Natalie, Goodbye Splendour,\" a book he wrote with his friend Marti Rulli. It was published in September 2009.  Davern has said he believes Wood's death was a direct result of a fight with Wagner.  In a lengthy interview with CNN in 2010, Davern said he now believes the investigation of Wood's death was incompetent and suggested there was a cover-up. He said he regrets misleading investigators by keeping quiet at Wagner's request.  Wood and Wagner married in 1957, divorced in 1962, then remarried in 1972. They often sailed their yacht off the coast of California and they invited Wood's \"Brainstorm\" co-star, Christopher Walken, to join them on a sail on Thanksgiving weekend in 1981.  The Hollywood rumor mill was abuzz with speculation that Wagner was jealous over Walken, but authorities have said Walken witnessed only the events leading up to an argument between the couple.  Wagner admitted his jealousy in his book \"Pieces of My Heart,\" also published in September 2009. He acknowledged that there had been a fight with Wood, writing that he smashed a wine bottle on a table.  After Wagner argued with Walken and broke the wine bottle, Wood left in disgust and went to her stateroom, Davern told CNN. Walken also retired to a guest room, Davern added, and Wagner followed his wife to their room. A few minutes later, Davern said, he could hear the couple fighting.  Embarrassed, Davern said he turned up the volume on his stereo. At one point, Davern recalled, he glanced out of the pilot house window and saw both Wagner and Wood on the yacht's aft deck. \"They'd moved their fight outside... you could tell from their animated gestures they were still arguing,\" he said.  A short time later, Wagner, appearing to be distraught, told Davern he couldn't find Wood. Davern searched the boat but couldn't find her. He noticed the rubber dinghy also was missing.  Wagner shrugged and poured them both drinks, Davern said. He suggested his wife had probably gone off in a temper.  Wagner's story, as told in his book, differs from Davern's. He maintains that after the argument with Walken, Wood went to her room and prepared for bed while he and Walken sat on the deck, cooling off.  Wagner writes that he went to check on Wood, but she wasn't there. He maintains that he and Davern searched the boat and noticed the dinghy was missing. Wagner assumed his wife had gone ashore on her own, he wrote.  He radioed the restaurant on shore where they'd had dinner and called the harbor master to see if anyone had seen Wood.  The dinghy was found about a mile away from the yacht, and a mile from where Wood's body was found.  Wood's first starring role was as a child in \"Miracle on 34th Street\" in 1947, and she played alongside some of Hollywood's top leading men -- James Dean in \"Rebel Without a Cause\" and Warren Beatty in \"Splendor in the Grass.\" She was nominated for Oscars in both of those films, as well as for \"Love With the Proper Stranger\" (1963), according to IMDb. One of her more memorable roles was as Maria in \"West Side Story.\"  Wagner's striking good looks landed him roles in dozens of films in the 1950s and '60s before he hit it big in television. He starred in two popular series, \"It Takes a Thief\" (1968-70) and \"Hart to Hart\" (1979-84), and more recently as Number Two in the \"Austin Powers\" spy spoofs.", "Q": ["Q: where is Detectives have yet to interview ?

{"article": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- She stood by her husband throughout the contentious 2008 presidential campaign and during heated health care reform debates during his presidency.  First lady Michelle Obama listens to remarks during a health care forum at the White House on Friday.  Now, as the debate is reaching a fever pitch, first lady Michelle Obama is weighing in on the issue by focusing on how health care can affect families.  \"What she's doing is putting a personal and human face on the issue... there's nothing more crucial,\" said Washington Post columnist Sally Quinn. \"Everybody gets sick, and everybody has someone in the family that gets sick.\"  \"I think if you can humanize it and personalize it, it suddenly brings it home to people -- especially those who are screaming and yelling about the government taking over,\" Quinn said.  On Friday, the first lady, a former hospital administrator, spoke about the issue to a crowd at the White House, highlighting her own family's experience with health care.  In one touching moment, Obama recalled when daughter Sasha exhibited signs of potentially deadly meningitis when she was 4 months old.  \"We didn't know what, but he [the doctor] told us she could have meningitis, so we were terrified. He said get to the emergency room right away,\" she said. \"Fortunately, things worked out.\"  \"But it is that moment in our lives that flashes through my head every time we engage in this health insurance conversation. It's that moment in my life, because I think about what on earth would we have done if we had not had insurance.\"  Mrs. Obama not only faced the issue as a mother, but also as a daughter.  \"My father has multiple sclerosis. He contracted it in his 20s.... He was able to get up and go to work every day, even though it got harder for him as he got sicker and more debilitated. And I find myself thinking what would we had done as a family on the south side of Chicago if my father hadn't had insurance.\"  Watch more of Michelle Obama's message \u00bb  Quinn says that personal story is critical in the health care debate -- something that has been lacking in the president's message so far, which has often been deemed by pundits as too policy-oriented and too surgical in nature.  \"What she's doing is she's humanizing the issue. And I think that has been missing in their [White House] campaign,\" she says. \"He's been so focused on the details and the strategy and the money that the individual problems and issues have seemed to have gotten lost in the fray.\"  Gloria Borger, a CNN senior political analyst, agreed.  \"I think she's always been a great asset to him,\" she said. \"She can help in this health care debate by not getting involved in the minutiae of the bills, but essentially emphasizing the reason we need health care reform. And that's what she will stick to.\"  Michelle Obama was a lightning rod -- both good and bad -- throughout her husband's presidential campaign. Now, in her role as first lady, she has garnered greater support among American voters from both parties.  A national survey by the Pew Research Center for People and the Press in April found that the first lady's positive ratings have increased since her husband took office. The poll found that 76 percent of Americans had a favorable opinion of her, which is up from 68 percent in January.  \"Much of the change has come among Republicans, especially Republican women,\" the organization noted. \"About two-thirds of Republican women [67 percent] have a favorable impression of Michelle Obama, a gain of 21 points since January.\"  But a first lady's involvement in health care reform is nothing new.  In the early '90s, first lady Hillary Clinton spearheaded the Clinton administration's push for reform, holding meetings, testifying before congressional committees and, in general, taking charge of the issue.  \"Hillary Clinton was the architect of health care reform,\" Borger said.  As for whether Michelle Obama is mirroring Clinton's role, the answer from both Borger and Quinn is absolutely not.  \"I don't see any parallels at all.... The Clintons came in, and they had run on the platform of buy one, get one free, a co-presidency and all of that. And she took over this huge thing herself. Bill wasn't doing it,\" Quinn said.  She said the president, not Michelle Obama, was the was the one who pushed health care reform in his early domestic agenda.  \"He promised in his campaign, and then he's the one that did it. This is not Michelle's plan. She hasn't been doing the town meetings and the national press conferences,\" she added.  Borger said that the first lady is playing a completely different role.  \"It's a much more supportive role, and it's a role out of the policy arena, but more in the arena of just why we ought to think we need reform.\"", "Q": ["Q: Will her remarks help her husband?

{"article": "  -- A new standoff was brewing in Honduras as the country's recently deposed president vowed to return, while the new provisional government said it would arrest him if he set foot back in the country.  Ousted Honduran President Jose Manuel Zelaya appears Tuesday at the U.N. General Assembly.  Political turmoil has swept this Central American nation of 8 million people following a military-led coup Sunday that ousted President Jose Manuel Zelaya. Troops entered the president's residence and sent him out of the country in exile. A veteran legislator, Roberto Micheletti, was sworn in that same day as provisional president with the support of congress.  Roberto Micheletti, the veteran legislator who was sworn in that same day as provisional president with the support of congress, was adamant that Zelaya would not return to power.  \"He already committed crimes against the constitution and the laws; he can't return to be president of the republic,\" Micheletti told reporters Tuesday. \"He can no longer return to the presidency unless a president from another Latin American country comes and imposes him with arms.\"  Micheletti added, \"If there is an invasion against our country, we have seven-and-a-half million Hondurans ready to defend our territory and our laws and our homeland and our government.\"  However, Zelaya still vows to defy the provisional government.  \"I am going to return on Thursday because they expelled me by force, and I am going to return as always: as a citizen and as president,\" Zelaya said at a U.N. news conference shortly after the world body unanimously adopted a resolution that he should be restored to power.  Zelaya, speaking to the U.N. General Assembly, called the resolution historic.  \"Your servant has several accusations against him in Honduras,\" Zelaya said. \"But nobody has given me a trial. Nobody has convened a tribunal.\"  Meanwhile, Micheletti's provisional government said Zelaya would be arrested if he returned.  \"As soon as he arrives he will be captured, as we already have the arrest warrants ready,\" new Foreign Minister Enrique Ortez Colindres told CNN en Espa\u00f1ol.  Zelaya would face charges of violating the constitution, corruption and drug trafficking, among others, Ortez said.  The deposed president said he would travel to Washington to attend a meeting of the Organization of American States. He also is expected to meet Tuesday evening with Tom Shannon, the top U.S. official on Latin America.  Even as Zelaya spoke at the United Nations, his opponents held a large and noisy rally in Tegucigalpa, the capital of Honduras. Crowd members waved blue and white Honduran flags and signs denouncing Zelaya.  Roberto Micheletti, the new provisional president, briefly addressed the crowd Tuesday afternoon. He vowed that the next national elections, slated for November, will be held as planned, and that a new president will be sworn in as usual in January.  Gen. Romeo Vasquez Velasquez, the top Honduran military commander who had butted heads with Zelaya, also spoke at the rally. By removing Zelaya, the armed forces were only complying with their constitutional duties, he said.  Before he spoke, the crowd chanted in support, \"Armed forces! Armed forces!\"  Zelaya supporters also were active Tuesday, with three major public-sector labor unions launching a general strike, a union official told CNN. About 100,000 workers joined the strike, said Oscar Garcia, vice president of the Honduran water workers union SANAA. That number could not be independently verified.  \"It will be an indefinite strike,\" Garcia said. \"We don't recognize this new government imposed by the oligarchy, and we will mount our campaign of resistance until President Manuel Zelaya is restored to power.\"  Also on Tuesday, the U.S. State Department said it was reviewing its aid to Honduras as it works with regional partners on a deal to restore Zelaya to power and quell political unrest in the country.  State Department spokesman Ian Kelly said the U.S. was reviewing whether Zelaya's ouster met the legal definition of a \"coup\" before any decision was made.  \"Because of the situation and the very dramatic nature of the events there and our profound concern about what's going on there, I think we're looking at a number of aspects of our cooperation,\" Kelly said.  The State Department has also issued a travel alert due \"to the current unstable political and security situation in Honduras.\" The alert \"recommends that American citizens defer all nonessential travel to Honduras until further notice.\"  In another development, two U.S. military officials in Washington confirmed to CNN that U.S. helicopters will fly over southern Honduras on a humanitarian relief mission Tuesday. The officials said there is great sensitivity to any public appearance by the U.S. military in the country.  The U.S. military also postponed some planned exercises with the Honduran military until the situation in the country settles down, according to the U.S. Southern Command.  \"We have postponed certain activities,\" Maj. D.L. Wright, Southern Command spokesman, told CNN.  Wright said this decision would be in effect for at least two to three weeks, or \"until the political situation settles.\"  Zelaya was overthrown early Sunday when the Honduran military arrested him and flew him to Costa Rica. Micheletti, president of the Congress, was sworn in as provisional president later Sunday.  The United Nations, OAS and most nations in the Western Hemisphere, including the United States, have condemned the ouster and demanded that Zelaya be restored to power.  The World Bank said Tuesday it would freeze funds to Honduras until the crisis is resolved, and the United States said it is reviewing its aid to the Central American nation. The U.S. joined many other nations in co-sponsoring Tuesday's U.N. resolution.  Zelaya had been at odds with the other branches of government over a referendum he wanted to hold Sunday. The Honduran Supreme Court had ruled that the referendum was illegal, and Congress had voted not to hold it.  The high court also had overturned Zelaya's dismissal of Honduras' top general, who said the military would not participate in the referendum. The court ordered that the general be reinstated immediately.  Zelaya disregarded those actions and vowed to hold the vote anyway.

David J. Lavau, 67, of Lake Hughes, California, was found in a ravine a week after losing control of his car on a rural road and plunging 500 feet down an embankment into heavy brush, according to a report by the California Highway Patrol.  Lavau, who is partially disabled, told authorities that he spent the first night in his car.  \"The next morning, he exited his vehicle and observed another vehicle adjacent to his own with a deceased male driver behind the wheel,\" the report said. \"The deceased appeared to have been there for some time.\"  Authorities say they have not identified the dead driver.  The case began to unfold on September 23, when Lavau failed to return home.  Lavau's family began searching for him when he failed to return home, driving the route and stopping at all the curves in the road from Castaic to his home in Lake Hughes.

{"article": "NEW YORK (CNN) -- Charges have been dropped against four men accused of raping an 18-year-old student at Hofstra University after the woman recanted her allegations, prosecutors said.  A Hofstra University student recanted her claims that she was lured to a dorm and assaulted in a bathroom stall.  A judge dismissed all charges Wednesday night and ordered the release of the four men -- Jesus Ortiz, 19; Stalin Felipe, 19; Kevin Taveras, 20; and Rondell Bedward, 21; all of the New York metropolitan area, according to Nassau County, New York, District Attorney Kathleen Rice.  They had been arrested, arraigned and jailed, with bail set at $500,000 each. Each was facing five counts of first-degree rape.  \"Late this evening, during the continuation of the Nassau County Police Department's investigation of the allegation, and under questioning by my office's chief trial attorney and chief sex crimes prosecutor, the alleged victim of the sexual assault admitted that the encounter that took place early Sunday morning was consensual,\" Rice said.  She said her office has launched a criminal investigation into the statements and reports given by the woman.  The student had told Nassau County police that she had been lured from a club, forced into a men's bathroom at a university dormitory, bound and assaulted.  The woman then called the university public safety office, which alerted local police.  The reported rape shocked the Hofstra University community.

{"article": " -- The son of Gabon's former president was declared the winner of the country's presidential elections on Thursday, sparking violent protests in some parts of the West African nation.  Two men walk by tyres set on fire by opposition supporters in Libreville, Gabon.  Voters went to the polls Sunday to elect a successor to President Omar Bongo, who died in June after more than four decades in office. Bongo, 73, was Africa's longest-serving ruler.  In a live announcement Thursday on Gabonese television, Interior Minister Jean Francois Ndongou said Ali Bongo received 41.73 percent of the votes in Sunday's election, with former interior minister Andre Mba Obame getting 25.88 percent and main opposition leader Pierre Mamboundou winning 25.22 percent.  Opposition supporters protested the results outside the French consulate in the oil-rich city of Port-Gentil, on the country's coast. A fire broke out at the consulate during the demonstrations, a French official told CNN. The official did not want his name to be used.  Some people were seriously injured in the blaze, the official said.  In his first address to the nation shortly after the results were announced, Ali Bongo, 50, promised to work to improve living conditions for all Gabonese by a redistribution of the country's riches, according to Gabonese media reports.  The country has multiple lucrative natural resources, including oil, timber, minerals and gems.  Before the results were made public, all three candidates had previously claimed victory, with the opposition candidates denouncing what they said was fraud in the election and vote-counting.  Security forces patrolled the streets in the Gabonese capital of Libreville, where violence broke out in some quarters when the results were released, according to French media reports.  Libreville was deserted because residents had fled to villages for fear of post-election violence, Andriankoto Ratozamanana told CNN by phone from the capital.  \"The citizens won't accept if Ali Bongo wins, because that will mean the government stole the vote,\" Ratozamanana said. \"They want change. They don't want Bongo, because he is his dad's son.\"  The younger Bongo, a former defense minister, was one of 23 politicians originally in the ballot. Several candidates pulled out a few days before the vote to support the opposition, said Archippe Yepmou, a media activist.  The elder Bongo took power in 1967, seven years after the country's independence from France.  He imposed one-party rule a year after succeeding the country's first president, who died in office. He allowed multiparty elections after a new constitution in 1991, but his party retained its grip on the government despite that.  The nation of about 1.5 million has a per capita income four times that of most sub-Saharan African nations, according to the CIA World Factbook.  Despite its wealth, which also comes from timber exports, a large percentage of its population lives in poverty because of poor financial management and a huge gap between the rich and the poor.

{"article": " -- For a little while, it looks like \"Up,\" Pixar's 10th feature-length film, is going to be a downer.  In \"Up,\" a curmudgeonly senior citizen, Carl, tries to cope with the enthusiasm of Russell, a young boy.  Not that there's anything wrong with an animated film tugging at our tear ducts. But you can sense unease rippling through the younger halves of the family audience when, about five minutes into a spunky prologue, intrepid pre-pubescents Carl and Ellie abruptly morph into newlyweds, and then not-so-newlyweds.  They gray and stoop before our eyes, youthful dreams of exploration traded in for the comforts of home and domestic bliss. Ellie wants a baby but can't have one. Their savings for the holiday of a lifetime are eaten up by this rainy day, that domestic disaster, until there's no more lifetime left -- not for Ellie, anyway.  That leaves us with Carl, a grumpy homebody voiced by Ed Asner, who makes WALL-E look like a chatterbox. And he's one of the main characters.  No, I didn't hear anyone demanding when the dancing penguins were going to show up, but I'll wager someone was thinking it.  Watch a preview of \"Up\" \u00bb  Such misgivings are ill-founded. As far as razzmatazz goes, \"Up\" delivers the goods. Not penguins, precisely, but more than the airborne house promised by the commercials.  There's a mythical multicolored bird, which may or may not be a snipe, but which answers to the name of Kevin and exhibits a sweet taste for candy bars. There are zeppelins and old-time explorers and talking dogs -- a whole pack of dogs, in fact. Dogs that serve wine and play cards and fly biplanes.  And there's Russell, a chubby Boy Scout -- or \"Wilderness Explorer\" -- who turns up on Carl's doorstep when he least expects it. After all, Carl wants to be free, and to get there, he launches his house into the sky thanks to thousands of balloons. How was he to know Russell was around?  \"Up\" doesn't always fly high. The dogs' canine high jinks are closer to \"Beverly Hills Chihuahua\" than we'd expect from Pixar, which tends not to play so fast and loose with the laws of nature for the sake of a few cheap laughs.  But if the muttering mutts keep the kids happy, well and good. The movie is on surer ground teasing out the relationship between Carl and Russell, floating well above the Earth.  Russell is all wide-eyed innocence and boundless enthusiasm, haplessly helpful. He's the mirror image of the child Carl used to be, if only the old man were capable of recognizing it.  But instead of looking around him, Carl is focused on landing that prize home of his in the prime location he mistakes for his ultimate destination (the lost world of Paradise Falls). The image of Carl valiantly dragging his house through jungle and over mountains will strike a chord with anyone holding down a mortgage. iReport.com: Share your review of \"Up\"  Written by Bob Petersen and directed by Petersen and Pete Docter -- both Pixar veterans -- \"Up\" mixes allegory with adventure and dumb imaginative exuberance. The balance isn't quite as tight as in Pixar's best movies, but the lightness is appealing, and Russell (voiced by Jordan Nagai) is an irresistible character. He's already carrying his own emotional baggage at 8 years old, but he's all heart, the kind to give kids a good name.  Screening in 3-D where possible, \"Up\" doesn't go overboard on stereoscopic gimmickry, but does exploit depth of field in a string of exhilarating cliffhangers and dogfights.  Funny and poignant and full of life, \"Up\" easily qualifies as one of the best movies of the year so far. Go with someone you care about.  \"Up\" is rated PG and runs 96 minutes.

{"article": "London, England (CNN) -- The value of shares in a British company drilling for oil off the Falkand islands halved Monday, after it revealed the existing supply may not be commercially viable.  In a statement on its Web site, Desire Petroleum said \"oil may be present in thin intervals but that reservoir quality is poor.\"  Desire will release the final results of its 30-day test drilling operation in the South Atlantic archipelago on Wednesday. According to the company it may have to drill deeper to find greater quantities of oil and gas.  Desire estimated that the North Falkland Basin could contain 3.5 billion barrels of oil as well as having \"significant gas potential.\"  But potential revenues from oil and gas reignited a long-running dispute between London and Buenos Aires over ownership of the Falklands.  Last month, Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner signed a decree requiring all ships navigating from Argentina to the islands to carry a government permit.  The Falklands, known as Las Malvinas in Argentina, lie in the South Atlantic Ocean off the Argentinean coast and have been under British rule since 1833.  Argentina has always claimed sovereignty over the islands and invaded them in 1982, prompting a war in which more than 600 Argentinean and 255 British military personnel died.  The island's government, representing a population of around 2,500, remains committed to British sovereignty and the UK maintains a military presence on the islands.  The Argentine position is that natural resources around the islands should be protected, and Britain must accept international resolutions labeling the Falklands a disputed area.  \"This has to do with the defense of the interests of Argentineans, not just about sovereignty,\" Argentine Cabinet Chief Anibal Fernandez said in February, adding that Argentina lays claim not just to the islands, but to any resources that could be found there.", "Q": ["Q: which nations are at odds A:", "Q: what does desire say A:", "Q: What quality is the reservoir?

{"article": "NEW YORK (CNN) -- New York celebrates the centennial of its most famous New Year's tradition Monday, as organizers of the Times Square ball drop have given the crystal globe an environmental makeover.  Technicians prepare the New York Times Square ball Thursday for the event's 100th anniversary.  This year the 1,415-pound ball has been outfitted with more than 9,500 energy-efficient light-emitting diodes that will illuminate the ball's more than 600 crystals. The LEDs will use the same amount of electricity as about 10 toasters, say event officials.  That's a dramatic overhaul from 1907's first Times Square ball, which was made from iron and wood and was covered with about 100 light bulbs.  Watch the computer-controlled ball \u00bb  New York police estimate about a million people will crowd Times Square to watch the ball drop from a flagpole atop the One Times Square building at midnight.  Another billion people worldwide are expected to watch the spectacle on video, said Tom Chiodo, a spokesman for the Times Square Alliance. Of those viewers, 100 million will be in the United States, he said.  New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg will be joined by Iraq war veteran Karolina Wierzchowska, who was also a Ground Zero guard worker and a New York Police Academy valedictorian -- to push the button for the ball drop at 11:59 p.m.  Weather forecasts indicate clear skies for the celebration, with temperatures in the 40s -- a mild departure from inclement weather gripping much of the Northeast.  In an effort to help people stay warm, New York City sanitation workers will be passing out \"goody bags\" from the Times Square Alliance that will include mittens and hats, said Chiodo.  The event will include musical performances from Hannah Montana, the Jonas Brothers, Kid Rock, Lenny Kravitz, Lifehouse, The Bravery, and alums from Fox TV's \"American Idol,\" Carrie Underwood, Jordin Sparks and Blake Lewis.  Security inside Times Square will be tight and everyone should expect to have their bags searched at least three times, said New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly on CNN's \"American Morning.\"  In addition to a heavy police presence on the ground, Kelly said the NYPD's counterterrorism unit, radiation detectors and helicopters will also be patrolling the crowds.  Kelly said that once the Times Square attendees pass the entrance gates, they will not be able to leave.  New York's terrorist threat level remains at orange -- the nation's second highest level -- as it has since the September 11, 2001, attacks.  \"We certainly haven't let our guard down,\" Kelly said.  As the ball drops, the new year will be greeted with a massive fireworks explosion, some 168 shots in the first five seconds alone, and a downpour of two tons of fireproof confetti. Some of the confetti includes New Year's wishes that were written by visitors to the city in nearly two dozen languages.  Over the past week, visitors from across the country wrote their messages on a Times Square \"Wishing Wall.\"  \"I want to turn the world green and the water clean,\" one person wrote.  \"Let my husband stop snoring,\" another wrote, while others were more serious: \"That my mom will get her kidney transplant\" and \"Peace in Pakistan.\" E-mail to a friend.", "Q": ["Q: What was the meeting about?

{"article": " -- Florida authorities were searching Sunday for a 33-year-old man after his wife and five children were found dead in their Naples home.  Mesac Damas pleaded no contest to the misdemeanor battery against Guerline Damas in June.  The bodies of Guerline Damas, 32; Michzach, 9; Marven, 6; Maven, 5; Megan, 3; and Morgan, 11 months, were discovered Saturday, Rambosk said.  Authorities have been unable to locate Mesac Damas, who possibly left the country Friday morning and may be in Haiti, Capt. Chris Roberts of the Collier County sheriff's department said Sunday at a news conference.  \"We don't see at this point any indication of an individual out in the neighborhoods committing additional crimes or homicides, but certainly we will look at every opportunity,\" Collier County Sheriff Kevin Rambosk said at an earlier news conference.  There had been a \"handful\" of domestic disturbance calls to police since 2000 involving the Damas couple, with the latest resulting in the arrest of Mesac Damas in January, Roberts said. Mesac Damas pleaded no contest to the misdemeanor battery against Guerline Damas in June, and Roberts said he does not think Mesac Damas served any jail time for the crime.  \"We are still talking to people that knew the family and obviously the ultimate information we need is not so much what happened in the past but what happened when these people died,\" Roberts said.  The six bodies were found Saturday at about 6:30 p.m., a day after police had visited the home to check on the family, Roberts said.  Watch why authorities are looking for Damas \u00bb  When a family member had not heard from a resident at the home, the family member asked authorities on Friday to do a welfare check on the house, Roberts said. Responding police knocked on the door but got no answer, he said, but officers saw no indications to arouse their suspicions.  The following morning, the family member became more concerned and filed a missing persons report, which authorities took, Rambosk said.  Later, authorities requested from property management a key to the house and an authorization to enter.  \"When we did, we found the bodies of the individuals,\" he said.  \"I can tell you that in no uncertain terms this is the most horrific and violent event this community has ever experienced. This is the worst of the worst.\"  He would not release the manner of death.  Rambosk said authorities had recovered Mesac Damas' vehicle at Miami International Airport, and they believe that he left on a flight to Haiti on Friday.

An Indian army soldier lays a wreath during the funeral of a slain soldier, northeast of Srinagar on Tuesday.  Defense Minister A.K. Antony, meeting with India's military chiefs in Delhi, reviewed the situation in the Himalayan region and told the Army to deal with the situation in the Himalayan region with \"utmost firmness.\"  Kashmir has been in the throes of a violent separatist campaign for nearly two decades during which authorities say 43,000 people have been killed. However, various NGOs and rights groups put the number of dead at twice the official count.  In Srinigar, Kashmir, Army spokesman Lt. Col. J.S. Brar told CNN the Army was moving against the militants \"based on sound intelligence inputs as well as human intelligence provided by our own sources.\"  The battles in the Shamsbhari forests of north Kashmir Kupwara district have caused \"minimum collateral damage to property,\" Brar said.  The spokesman denied media reports that helicopter gunships and heavy weapons had been used by the army during these operations against the militants.  This month's encounter between the Indian Army and the militants is the second longest in Kashmir this year. In January, a fierce encounter raged for seven days in the Poonch district of Jammu region of Indian-administered Kashmir. Two soldiers, a policeman and four militants were killed in that encounter.

{"article": "Mexico City, Mexico (CNN) -- Mexico City, the country's capital, is one of the world's important cultural centers -- showcasing Latin America's rich history and traditions.  \"I love its uniqueness,\" CNN's Armando Talamantes said of the city where he lives and works. \"The weather is never too hot and never too cold.\"  What's just right is the city's endless supply of music, local food and art museums. With a population of 8.8 million people, Mexico City is one of the most densely populated areas in the country and one of the richest cities in the world. It's also a huge attraction for soccer fans and bullfighting enthusiasts.  From eating out any time of the night to enjoying a day in the \"Mexican Venice,\" or Xochimilco, to visiting the pyramids just outside the city, Talamantes says Mexico City is a constant surprise and delight. Here, he offers some insider tips on traveling to his hometown:  Where can you get the best view of the city?  If you're downtown, go to the top of Torre Latinoamericana. It was the tallest skyscraper in Mexico City for many years. Now, it's kind of old but keeps its charm.  If you're on Reforma, Mexico's most beautiful avenue, try to step into Piso 51 in Torre Mayor, the tallest skyscraper in Latin America. Beware: It is a private club, and you will be asked to join.  Which restaurant would you take your loved one to for an anniversary or other special occasion?  Taberna del Le\u00f3n in Plaza Loreto offers traditional Mexican cuisine in a cozy environment. It's managed by M\u00f3nica Pati\u00f1o, the famous Mexican chef.  Where is the best place to people watch?  Try barrio La Condesa -- its streets are full of bars and restaurants attracting a very interesting crowd, especially on nights and weekends. Also, you can go to Emilio Castelar, a street in Polanco full of life and good-looking people.  What is your favorite neighborhood? Why?  Colonia Roma is becoming the \"Mexican Soho,\" with lots of galleries, restaurants, bars, boutique hotels, fountains and squares. It is antique, so you can find old buildings, but it's also transforming into a more modern area.  It is close to La Condesa, which is also a very cool place, full of young people.  What's the biggest misconception about your city?  You won't believe how many trees are in the city. And the robberies aren't that common, either.  Where do you go to relax?  Espacio Escult\u00f3rico at the UNAM, Mexico's biggest university campus, offers a collection of sculptures by famous artists. That is a little farther south of the city. If you're not willing to travel that much, go into Bosque de Chapultepec's audiorama, where you can sit on a bench and listen to some good music.  What essential thing should visitors see or experience if they have only a few hours?  Go inside Museo de Antropolog\u00eda, which showcases the very DNA of Mexico. If you don't want to step into a museum, go downtown to see El Zocalo (Mexico City's main square) and Templo Mayor, the remains of an ancient Aztec temple.  What's the biggest tourist trap? Is there a \"tourist trap\" that's actually worth seeing?  The biggest tourist trap is Plaza Garibaldi, were the mariachis are awful and you can get mugged. A trap that could be worth seeing is the area called Xochimilco, often called \"Mexican Venice\" because of a series of canals.  Where was your most memorable meal? Where's your favorite place to spend a night out on the town?  Zinco bar, on Cinco de Mayo Street in downtown, has great jazz music and a very cheerful crowd.  Are there local specialty dishes or drinks that visitors must try?  Not really. Just stick to the tacos and tequila as if you were any place in Mexico. If you want something fancy, try duck enchiladas in Izote restaurant on Avenue Presidente Masaryk, Mexico's most expensive street.  What is a good local souvenir?

{"article": " -- The alleged gang rape of a 15-year-old girl on the campus of Richmond High School in Northern California while 10 or more witnesses, most of them students, looked on has sparked familiar questions: \"Why are our kids so messed up?\" \"Why didn't these students try to stop the crime?\" \"What's happening in our schools?\"  These are fair questions, and commentators in the media have provided familiar answers. The purported rape is another sad example of today's self-absorbed and uncaring youth. It was the media's glorification of violence that caused it. The horrific act shows how sociopathic brains develop. But it seems as if the majority of commentators have settled on the idea that the Richmond students did nothing because of the \"bystander effect\": The more people involved in a criminal incident, the less likely any one of them will intervene to do something about it.  Unfortunately, this \"What's wrong with our children?\" approach leads to a dead end, because it results in a sweeping moral condemnation of the schools, families and students in this community. These perpetrators committed a heinous act that should be widely condemned. But a discussion that focuses exclusively on the immorality of these deviant young men does not provide solutions that prevent gang rape from happening.  Talking only about the bystander effect wrongly suggests that the vast majority of teens would not call for help. Take Richmond. Claims of depraved acts by a few kids have served to demonize an entire student community.  Rather than demonize all teenagers in Richmond High School, we should be asking another question: \"What can we do to prevent such heinous acts from happening?\"  The answer to that question leads to a wholly different kind of dialogue, one that may surprise. It is primarily students, the reputed problem, who can best prevent acts of violence on campus.  Make no mistake about it. The alleged two-hour-long gang rape on October 24 was an extreme form of school violence. It unfolded not far from the gym where the school-sponsored homecoming dance, supervised by school staff and police officers, was being held. And students, police say, largely perpetrated it.  Research since the massacres at Columbine High School (1999) and Virginia Tech (2007) has taught us a lot about how to prevent such school violence. Chief among them is that school staff and security should patrol campuses, especially violence-prone areas, during and after school events.  According to a CNN report, a friend of the alleged victim saw blatant failures in safety precautions. She said, \"I looked outside of the gym, and I saw 12 to 15 guys, sitting there, with no IDs. The officers -- not only did they not check the IDs of those students or men sitting outside of of our campus, but the security officers who are employed here did no job of checking either.\"  Virtually all students and teachers at a school can identify these dangerous hot spots. At Richmond High School, one such spot is \"a dark alley near the back side of the school,\" the site of the purported rape.  As CNN reported, school officials had even requested that video cameras and more lights be installed in the area, but they were never installed. The alleged rapists and student bystanders probably knew that no one would be patrolling the area.  As important as campus patrols are in reducing campus violence, the most powerful form of prevention is believing that students can help stop crime from happening. They didn't stop the purported rape at Richmond, a skeptic might say. A possible reason is that they were not educated on how to stop it..  Research shows us that students often know ahead of time when and where violence will flare up on campus. Strong social networks and the widespread use of cell phones and text messaging rapidly convey such information.  This dynamic can fuel violence, as officials say it did at Richmond High School. It can also prevent violence. Thousands of potential school crimes, including violent ones, have been averted on campuses across the country because students alerted school officials before the crime occurred.  Students and families using a hot line in Colorado were credited with preventing more than 206 incidents of school violence from 2004-06. As of summer 2009, this one hot line fielded 1,687 reports that resulted in crime prevention or intervention.  Alert students have also helped prevent replays of the tragedies that occurred at Columbine and Virginia Tech by tipping off school officials. Several years ago, student reports stopped a Columbine-style massacre plot, employing bombs, napalm and automatic weapons, at a high school in Green Bay, Wisconsin.  This year, tips from students and alert teachers and police disrupted a student-massacre plot, featuring pipe bombs and firearms, at Hillside High School in San Mateo, California. Since Columbine, school shootings have been averted in New Bedford, New York, and Covina, California, to name some others.  And at Richmond, it was an 18-year-old bystander, overhearing others talking about the incident, who reported the crime.  Unfortunately, the public is largely unaware of these frequently heroic acts by high school students and their teachers because they don't often get national media attention. That lack of information has helped obscure the important roles that students and their responsive teachers play in preventing school violence.  But the evidence is clear. Students who know what to do when they witness school violence, or when they have a strong sense of impending violence, will become anonymous heroes. But they need to be taught what to do, which phone numbers -- including hot lines -- to call and which school officials or police department can be trusted to act on their reports. Students also need to feel confident that they can report trouble without fear of retribution from their peers or being called a snitch.  It is up to the teachers and administrators who run schools to teach their students these procedures. They need to convince students that they will listen and respond consistently to their reports of violence or possible violence.  Yes, local police need to develop trusting relationships with students and the overall community, or nothing will be reported. But the job of preventing violence on campus belongs primarily, if not solely, to the schools.  Rather than wring our hands about the so-called immorality of today's students, we should embrace them as full partners in the prevention of violence on campus. Morality is not the issue. If students are educated on what to do when the threat of violence arises and are encouraged to follow the procedures, they can be trusted to do the right thing.

{"article": "  -- Swedish golfer Henrik Stenson carded a solid 69 in the opening round of the WGC-CA Championship but it was his highly unusual recovery shot on the 12th on the Blue Monster course at Doral which raised more than a few eyebrows.  Stenson did not leave much to the imagination with his Doral antics.  Stenson stripped down to the bare essentials -- a pair of white boxer shorts -- before wading into the mud to hack out his ball after an wayward tee shot.  The watching galleries could hardly believe their eyes as the tall Swede peeled off his clothes.  \"Shirt, trousers, socks, shoes, hat, the lot was off,\" he told the Press Association.  \"Because of the mud I couldn't really afford to play in any of my clothes as they would have been a real mess down the last six or so holes so I had no option,\" Stenson explained.  After getting the ball back on to the fairway, Stenson eventually made a one-over par bogey on the hole when he could have dropped at least two shots by taking a drop.  \"If you are saving a shot, that has to be worth taking your shirt and trousers,\" he added.  What do you think of Stenson's cheeky recovery shot ?  The incident proved the main talking point on the day that Tiger Woods made his return to strokeplay golf and 32-year-old Stenson jokingly said it might offer a new avenue for sponsorships.  \"Absolutely, you never know, after this I might have a new endorsement with PlayGirl or something like that.\"  European Ryder Cup star Stenson is playing for the $1.4 million first prize in the tournament in Florida which has an elite 81-strong field.  His recovery shot evoked memories of the last-hole drama at the 1999 British Open at Carnoustie when tournament leader Jean Van de Velde waded into the Barry Burn after taking off his shoes and socks.  The Frenchman at least spared the blushes of the crowds by keeping on his clothes but he made a hash of hole and lost his chance of winning the famous major.", "Q": ["Q: Where was the tournament?

{"article": " -- The European Commission handed down its ruling in a landmark anti-trust case against Intel Wednesday, fining the computer chip giant a record  $1.45 billion for abusing its dominant position in the computer processing unit (CPU) market.  On Wednesday the European Commission fined Intel a record $1.45 billion for violating anti-trust laws.  The ruling, which Intel plans to appeal, may have future implications for American companies accused of \"jurisdiction shopping\" to avoid anti-trust verdicts against them, says CNN's Jim Boulden, who explains the basics of the Intel case.  The commission has hit Intel with the biggest fine ever -- what were its reasons?  The European Commission says Intel has been abusing its dominant market position in semiconductors for years. The EC says Intel has systematically given PC makers and stores rebates to keep computers with AMD chips off the shelves. AMD (another American company and Intel's only competitor) first raised the red flag in 2000.  Why does the commission have the power to impose such fines?  EU law does not regard market dominance as illegal, but it is allowed to fine a company that abuses its position as the biggest in any given market. It has a guideline of fining a company based on a percentage of profits.  EU law is set up to \"protect consumers,\" and the anti-trust office says consumers were hurt. Yet as Intel likes to point out, consumers did not launch this case -- AMD, a competitor, launched this in Europe (and in Japan and South Korea) as the U.S. antitrust officials under George W. Bush were unlikely to pursue a case on these merits.  The EU could fine Intel (or any company) based on 10% of global annual revenues, but chose to fine it on a smaller percentage made in the EU.  Can Intel afford to pay this fine? What state is the company in at the moment?  Intel reported first quarter revenue of $7 billion. It can easily afford this. Interestingly, it lost 4 percent of its market share to AMD so far this year.  The company says it will appeal -- when is that likely to be heard?  Another appeal will take months. Intel already appealed a preliminary part of this ruling last year and lost. Meanwhile, the EC can argue that Intel is still abusing its position and increase the fine during the appeals process, as it did to Microsoft.  Intel is not the first tech company to be hit by the European Commission. What about Microsoft?  The anti-trust unit has launched another round of investigations against Microsoft. It has already paid its fine and the EU continues to watch the company's behavior on the previous matters.  What kind of precedent does the Intel case set?  The EU has fined all kinds of cartels and market abusers, but rarely does it fine big American companies based on complaints from American competitors -- so the case catches the eye, especially with critics who accuse American companies of \"jurisdiction shopping\" to get a favorable outcome.", "Q": ["Q: what is happening with microsoft A:", "Q: when European Commission fines Intel a record $1.45 billion?

{"article": " -- Get four successful women together on a movie set and you'd think it's all claws, all the time.  Some rumors would insinuate that \"Sex and the City's\" Kim Cattrall doesn't get along with her co-star Kristin Davis, while another would allege there were catfights on the set of the sequel, as the stars revealed in the June issue of Marie Claire magazine.  Last week there was a similar tiff making headlines, although the spat seemed to be a bit one-sided. In an interview with Out magazine, pop star Christina Aguilera referred to fellow superstar Lady Gaga as a \"newcomer\" who was \"fun to look at,\" but Aguilera posted a statement on her website claiming that there wasn't any malice behind those words.  \"It is very easy for comments to be taken out of context and create unnecessary drama -- especially between us women,\" Aguilera said in the statement. \"So I would like to tell you all directly so my words cannot be misconstrued to sell someone else's story.... I have absolutely nothing against Lady Gaga or any other female artist in this business.\"  As Aguilera noted in her statement, this isn't the first time she's \"been unfairly pitted against another female artist.\"  If Aguilera or the \"Sex and the City\" stars really are estranged from other famous women, so be it -- but why no mention of their relationship with co-stars Chris Noth or John Corbett? For that matter, where are the stories about how the male actors got along on the set?  \"There are hardly ever any stories about male celebrities fighting,\" said celebrity blogger Vera Sweeney, who runs IAmNotObsessed.com. \"Even when Shia LaBeouf got into that car accident while on a date with Isabel Lucas -- even though she was dating Adrian Grenier at the time -- nothing happened. Adrian said they weren't serious, and the story was dropped.\"  Obviously, this doesn't mean that male celebrities are never pitted against one another in the media -- take a look at earlier beefs between Kid Rock and Tommy Lee, Eminem and Moby or Nas and Jay-Z.  The difference, said Robert Thompson, director of the Bleier Center for Television and Popular Culture at Syracuse University, is that those battles are often steeped with violent overtones, and they're treated with more severity than the disputes female celebrities are rumored to have.  Or, Sweeney said, the \"celebrity men in conflict\" angle will be given a different spin.  \"Instead of there being a power struggle or an emotional issue, different work ethics will most likely be cited,\" she said. \"For example, when Christian Bale and Johnny Depp filmed 'Public Enemy' it was said that both men wanted to stay in character even when they weren't shooting. So it was understood why they weren't friendly with one another in between takes -- because they were 'in character.' If two women did that, it would be pitched as a cover-up for a more deep[ly] rooted reason.\"  The actresses themselves seem to accept it as just another part of an oft-dirty business. \"The chemistry among the four of us is very strong, [but]... the press has to put women in these boxes, rather than show them as the movie portrays them: working together and being powerful,\" Cattrall said in the Marie Claire interview. \"Things just have to be explosive for no other reason than for people's imaginations.\"  A likely reason for the media coverage, explained pop culture expert and \"The Cult of Celebrity\" author Cooper Lawrence, is because \"it's much easier to believe that women don't like each other. It's one of the few bastions of sexism that's left in our culture, and we can't imagine that powerful, successful women could ever get along.\"  It all boils down to the gender norms many of us are raised with, Thompson said.  \"One theory we can reject is that the women are fighting with each other more than the men are.... Anyone who's been in a workplace knows that it's not an inherently gender-specific sort of thing,\" Thompson said. But \"with the gender norms that we've all grown up with, men manifest their 'cattiness' differently than women; we're OK with the idea that women are emotional, and we expect them to be.\"  But said Ian Drew, senior editor of celebrity magazine Us Weekly, you can't discount the reality of the entertainment industry -- and that's to sell albums and rack up box-office numbers.  \"Obviously, this is a competition,\" Drew said. \"People need to be responsible for their own actions -- [Aguilera] did say those words, and she said those things for a reason. Lady Gaga, for example, never says anything negative about anybody.\"  If these stars wouldn't send the media smoke signals with their words or actions, Drew said, the media wouldn't start yelling fire. \"No one is a victim in the celebrity world,\" he added. \"Very few of those rumors end up not being true.\"  Regardless of whether they're true or not, Sweeney said she's willing to bet the stories of this starlet being angry at that one aren't likely to let up anytime soon.  \"The question isn't why are these stories about women catfights being created,\" she said. \"Unfortunately, the question is why not? People enjoy the drama, and drama and divalike behavior sells.\"", "Q": ["Q: what does the editor say A:", "Q: what does us weekly editor state?

{"article": " -- Republican presidential hopeful Mitt Romney has scored the endorsement of Bob Dole, who lauded the former Massachusetts governor in an ad Sunday in Iowa's The Des Moines Register newspaper.  The public endorsement comes one day after the Register -- Iowa's largest newspaper -- backed Romney in his bid for the Republican presidential nomination and just over two weeks before Iowa's critical presidential caucuses on January 3.  In his advertisement, Dole said Romney is the GOP candidate is best suited to defeat President Barack Obama in 2012.  \"I've known Mitt and his family for decades. His parents instilled in him a strong work ethic, rock-solid conservative values, and a deep sense of service to others,\" the former Kansas senator and 1996 GOP presidential nominee wrote. \"These traits -- which have shone through in both the debates and in my own visits with him -- will serve him well in the White House.\"  Dole also said Romney \"rescued a flailing Winter Olympics when it was mired in financial scandal.\" And as governor of Massachusetts, Dole wrote, Romney \"managed to both balance the state's budget and cut taxes while dealing with an overwhelmingly Democratic state legislature.\"  The Register's editorial board said Romney was the most qualified candidate competing in the caucuses.  While the paper didn't endorse Romney during his last run for president in 2007, the editorial board said voters now face a different GOP field and Romney \"has matured as a candidate.\"  \"Rebuilding the economy is the nation's top priority, and Romney makes the best case among the Republicans that he could do that,\" the editorial board wrote.  The board hailed Romney for his \"solid credentials,\" saying he was the most likely candidate to see through \"knee-jerk, ideological\" perspectives and \"bridge the political divide in Washington.\"  Taking issue with the two other top-tier candidates, the paper claimed Romney stood out against former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, whom the board called \"an undisciplined partisan who would alienate, not unite, if he reverts to mean-spirited attacks on display as House speaker.\"  It also criticized Texas Rep. Ron Paul as someone with a libertarian ideology that would \"lead to economic chaos and isolationism.\"  Also significant, the board somewhat defended Romney against a line of attack taken by opponents who criticize him as a \"flip-flopper.\"  \"Though Romney has tended to adapt some positions to different times and places, he is hardly unique. It should be possible for a politician to say, 'I was wrong, and I have changed my mind',\" the paper wrote.  But the paper still reserved questions over his changing tune on issues such as abortion and said it was up to the voters to decide \"whether such subtly nuanced statements express Romney's true beliefs or if he's trying to have it both ways.\"  While the paper's endorsement is highly coveted, it does not necessarily spell success for a candidate.  In the last election cycle, the paper endorsed GOP Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who didn't actively campaign in the state and took third place in the caucuses, while former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee pulled off a surprise victory.  The newspaper has long endorsed candidates for the general presidential election, but it began making endorsements for the caucuses in 1988.  Since then, three of its choices went on to win the contest: Dole in 1996 and 1988 and then-Texas Gov. George W. Bush in 2000.  In addition, three endorsees eventually secured the Republican nomination: Dole in 1996, Bush in 2000 and McCain in 2008.  Only one of its chosen candidates - Bush in 2000 - went on to win the White House.  According to an American Research Group poll taken Dec. 8-11, Romney placed second in the Hawkeye State with 17% of support among likely caucus voters, while Gingrich took first with 22%. Paul tied with Romney at 17%  On Friday, Romney garnered a nod from South Carolina Republican Gov. Nikki Haley. South Carolina's primary, set for January 21, is the first presidential contest in the South and the third overall in the early voting season.

{"article": "  -- Despite the rise of the Web and its freewheeling second-by-second ferment, government efforts at control and censorship remain rife across the Middle East and North Africa, a new report said Thursday.  \"In the Middle East and North Africa, the Internet has offered many people access to information and the outside world that would have been unimaginable a few years ago,\" according to the International Press Institute's latest report: the IPI Press Review 2009 Focus on the Middle East and North Africa.  \"However, government control of the media remains tight in almost all [Middle East and North Africa] countries, and censorship and self-censorship are prevalent throughout the region.\"  The Internet has emerged as a challenge to officialdom and its pronouncements and reaction from activists. Journalists say government efforts to stem the flow of information are futile.  Communication on the popular social media sites, where people are attempting to elude the strictures of their governments, is playing a cat-and-mouse game with widespread independent reporting in places like Iran and Egypt.  But, said Anthony Mills, managing editor of the World Press Freedom Review based in Vienna, Austria, \"Overall, things are getting worse.\"  In Iran, authorities cracked down on journalists after protests surfaced when President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was declared the winner in the June 12 presidential election, a victory that many in Iran say was fixed.  \"Dozens of journalists have been detained without trial, and several sentenced to long prison sentences,\" the report said. \"As demonstrators took to the streets, a news blackout was imposed on the foreign media. And yet, through social media networks like Facebook, YouTube and Twitter, news of a violent government crackdown seeped out.\"  With the rise of the Internet, censorship efforts have emerged in Iran and other places across the region.  Iran \"also cracked down on online media following the disputed June elections, and arrested online activists in an effort to stop the spread of dissenting information and opinions,\" according to the report.  Egypt, for example, uses a law designed to combat terror for arresting and detaining bloggers.  But Abdul Rahman al-Rashed, general manager of the TV network Al-Arabiya, said the resistance to the flood of Internet information from government and other sectors of society is like trying to stop the Nile River from flowing. They can't halt it.  \"A lot of information is getting through to the average person, in Cairo, in Jeddah and Dubai. Censorship will not stop the free flow of information, in my opinion,\" he said.  Al-Rashed said the business needs of the telecommunications companies, the integral role the Internet plays in business, and the demand from citizens can't be thwarted. He said there might be remote regions where censorship can work because there isn't access to the Internet in such places.  Octavia Nasr, CNN senior editor for the Middle East who monitors social media sites, said young people are boldly circumventing the official media censorship across the Middle East with Twitter, Facebook and alternatives.  \"People are taking matters into their own hands,\" Nasr said. \"Traditional media is not necessarily a driving force.\"  Azza Matar, translator at the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information in Cairo, Egypt, said governments want the Arab world to use the Internet for fun and not interfere with government and serious issues, but people are circumventing the officials with new media.  \"We're trying to express ourselves and expose the lies,\" she said.  People from different countries prefer different kinds of new media, she said. As for Iranians, who are gearing up for a day of protests Thursday against the regime on the Islamic Revolution's anniversary, she said Iranians prefer Twitter because it can't be blocked and \"is faster than blogs in conveying messages for masses.\"  Neziha Rejiba, vice president of the Tunis-based Observatory for the Freedom of Press, Publishing and Creation and editor at Kalima Radio, said that theoretically, the whole world is getting its information online, but in the Middle East, censorship remains a reality, with cyberpolice blocking sites or even, as in the case of Syria, the Internet itself.  There is a dynamic in the Middle East between censorship and self-censorship.  \"When journalists sit down to write a piece, they have to keep in mind the reaction to what they're writing. They're either scared of sanctions or revenge.\"  Bahrain's Foreign Minister Khalid Al Khalifa said the Internet \"has revolutionized the world\" and \"has helped foster creativity, innovation and freedom.\"  There have been complaints there about the recent blocking of Web sites in Bahrain.  While Al Khalifa said regulating different kinds of censorship internationally is impractical, he said in the Middle East, censorship takes forms he has mixed feelings about.  \"Censorship can be taken too far to silence dissent and opposing views, but it can also be used as a tool to prevent potentially destructive and damaging ideas and behavior. There is increasing concern about harmful content on the Internet from violence, inciting racial hatred and terrorist activity, to sexual content and pornography, which justifies censorship on moral grounds,\" Al Khalifa said.  As for other aspects of the Middle East and its media, the report reveals several relative silver linings when it comes to press freedom: the environment in Lebanon, Israel and the United Arab Emirates.  Lebanon has a \"far and more diverse and vibrant media than any other Arab country,\" but the institute found that \"most of Lebanon's media outlets are unduly influenced in their journalism content by powerful political figures to whom they are financially and politically beholden.\"  Mills said the media in Lebanon can be characterized as \"partly free\" because there's a lot they don't talk about, such as criticism of military intelligence and the head of state, for example.  According to the report, \"Israel has one of the most open media environments in the Middle East\" for Israeli journalists with a wide range of opinions and commentary.  At the same time, Israeli security policy prevents Israeli journalists from traveling into the Palestinian territories without special permission, and Palestinian journalists are prevented from entering Israel.  The report said both Israeli soldiers and Palestinian security forces interfere with the work of Palestinian journalists, and that journalists in Gaza have to resort to self-censorship.  Freedom of speech and press in the United Arab Emirates gets \"some of the highest marks in the Arab world,\" but it \"still has a long way to go.\"  The report cited a \"number of taboo topics that journalists in the United Arab Emirates are not supposed to touch and indeed, most of the media do not,\" such as criticism of the ruling family. Across the Middle East, criticism of royal families and words perceived as insults to Islam have been criminalized.  In Iraq, violence there has dropped and so has the number of journalists' deaths, but \"the U.S. military continues to imprison journalists without charge\" and local security forces have been responsible for beating journalists. There is concern about the rise of proposed legislation stifling media freedom.  In Syria, which has \"one of the world's worst records on media freedom,\" the media outlets are owned or controlled by the government. Political unrest elsewhere, the report said, is accompanied by media crackdowns, such as in Yemen, where there has been an insurgency in the north and civil unrest in the south. Elections in Algeria and Tunisia have also led to press freedom violations.  Governments have controlled \"moral content\" as well, the report said.  \"In Saudi Arabia, several people involved in the production of a television show about sexual attitudes were sentenced to flogging and jail terms. In Sudan, journalist Lubna Hussein was sentenced to a flogging for wearing trousers. Following international uproar, the punishment was reduced to a fine, which was then paid by a pro-government journalists' association.\"", "Q": ["Q: What actually happens with the news?

{"article": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- It is not often that football players are actively encouraged to play dirty -- unless of course they are taking part in a unique variant of the game called \"Swamp Soccer\" when it is virtually unavoidable.  The competition is fierce in the 2009 Swamp Soccer World Championship held in Scotland  Originating from the bogs of Finland, the game was started by cross-country skiers who used the football matches in knee-deep mud to strengthen their leg muscles.  The first tournament took place in 1997 with 13 teams, but now annual events take place in Sweden, Iceland, Russia and Brazil which can often feature over 200 teams.  What do you think of Swamp Soccer? Do you prefer Beach Football of another form of the game? Let us know your thoughts on the 'Sound off' box below.  Glasgow Rangers fan Stewart Miller imported the concept to the United Kingdom after a chance meeting with founder Jyrki Vaananen while on a business trip to Iceland.  Miller launched the first UK tournament in 2005 and now teams travel from all over the globe to the Scottish village of Strachur to try and become the annual Swamp Soccer World Champions.  Watch the action from the bog \u00bb.  \"We had teams coming from as far afield as Australia and New Zealand to take part in the tournament this year so there is an international flavor to the event,\" Miller told CNN.  \"There is a huge appetite to try out new things and I think that's why Swamp Soccer is able to capture the imagination of people.  \"The basic rules of football also apply to Swamp Soccer with the exception that matches are played in thick mud with six players on an oversized five-a-side pitch.  \"It's probably one of the only sports in the world where the worse the conditions are the better the sporting spectacle!\"  There is no offside in Swamp Soccer while kick-offs, throw-ins, corner kicks, free kicks and penalties are taken by using the hands to drop the ball onto a chosen foot.  Teams are also allowed to make unlimited substitutions although no shoe changing is allowed for the match duration.  Miller believes that the oft-used quote that the state of a pitch can bridge the gap between two unevenly match teams is even more applicable with Swamp Soccer.  \"You could put the Brazilian national side up against an amateur team and you wouldn't know who would come out on top -- the pitch really does prove to be a leveler in this instance,\" he said.  \"Although professional footballers are precious commodities these days -- I'm not sure we'll see any stars getting caked in mud too soon, most of them are far to pampered for that.  \"Nobody's ever been injured seriously playing in the swamp, sometimes somebody's got a cut or two but nothing big -- so maybe when they retire from the game they might be prepared to give it a go.\"  The imaginatively titled Real Mudrid, Mudchesthair United and Cowdungbeath were unable to make it past the group stages in the 44-team event which was won by FC Full Gunge from Poole in England who retained their title with a 1-0 victory over The Chocolate Men.  This year's Swamp Soccer tournament was held in a village in the Scottish countryside but Miller revealed that he intends to bring the mud game to metropolitan areas.  He added: \"The future for Swamp Soccer is in the city and of course I'm certain we'll bring all the mud with us. It will certainly make a great spectacle if set up a swamp in the middle of Glasgow or Edinburgh, so watch this space.\"  If you are interested in taking part in the 2010 Swamp Soccer World Championships visit the official Web site of the tournament.", "Q": ["Q: Where was Swamp Soccer started?

{"article": " -- Internet sensation Susan Boyle came up short, coming in second during \"Britain's Got Talent\" finale on Saturday.  Fans cheering on Susan Boyle react after she comes in second during \"Britain's Got Talent.\"  Boyle was upset by winner Diversity, a 10-person dance group from Essex and East London, England, ranging in age from 12 to 25 years old. The group won 100,000 British pounds ($161,000) and will perform for Queen Elizabeth II in the Royal Variety Show.  \"The best people won,\" Boyle said.  The dancers appeared shocked Saturday when it was announced that they had won.  The group was formed in 2007, and in the same year won the United Kingdom Dance Championships.  The group's choreographer \"tries to create a dance style that is eye-catching and entertaining\" and uses films such as 2007's \"Transformers\" for inspiration, the show's site said.  Boyle wowed the crowd Saturday night with an encore performance of the song that first made her so famous around the world -- \"I Dreamed a Dream,\" from the musical \"Les Miserables.\"  After her performance Saturday, the crowd and judges gave Boyle, who wore a floor-length gown, a standing ovation.  Boyle finishes second \u00bb  \"You had the nerve to come back here tonight, face your critics and beat them,\" judge Simon Cowell told her. \"You did it.\"  Boyle had vowed to leave the television show before the finale, after a hectic week, but recanted and performed at the finale Saturday.  The 48-year-old Scottish singer wowed audiences and judges during her audition in April when she belted out \"I Dreamed a Dream.\" Her performance earned her a string of global television appearances.  During the semifinals Sunday, she started off by missing the first note of her performance of \"Memory\" from the musical, \"Cats.\"  Watch Boyle's semifinal performance \u00bb  She redeemed herself to earn a standing ovation and a spot in Saturday's finale.  The global fame and the \"odd bit of negative press\" in the past week have been too overwhelming for her, judge Piers Morgan told CNN's \"Larry King Live\" on Friday.  \"She's just had a pretty rough week because I think the full enormity of what has happened to her is beginning to hit home,\" Morgan said.  \"Earlier this week, she had a lot of tears.... At one stage, she was going to leave the show. So, fortunately, we've calmed everything down.\"  Watch how Boyle may be feeling the pressure \u00bb  Boyle said that that she has put the tumultuous week behind her and is getting ready for the finale.  \"It's all I've been thinking about,\" she said on the show's Web site. \"I'm not going to throw away my big chance now.\"  \"Britain's Got Talent\" defended Boyle on its Web site, saying that media reports of an emotional outburst \"have been taken out of context.\"  The unemployed charity worker has inspired millions in the face of pop music's penchant for pre-processed princesses.  Before she sang during her audition, the unassuming single woman with a loose mop of curly hair drew snickers from the audience, including notoriously hard-to-please judge Simon Cowell.  The scowls and eye-rolling were replaced by wild cheers as soon as she sang the first line.  Cowell later apologized for poking fun at her during the auditions stage.  \"You are one special lady,\" he said last week. \"You really are.\"  Reporters made their way to her quiet home in Blackburn, West Lothian, Scotland, much to Boyle's great surprise.  \"I keep my feet firmly planted on the ground, because you have to,\" Boyle told CNN last month.  Asked what has been the most surprising change since her audition, she responded simply -- \"The way everyone seems to have embraced me.

{"article": " -- The city of Fargo, North Dakota, largely completed flood preparations early Thursday as a surging Red River rose nearly 3 feet in 24 hours.  The waterway was well beyond its banks along the North Dakota-Minnesota line.  \"Thanks to our volunteers, we've been able to fill a million sandbags and place 700,000 around our city,\" Fargo spokeswoman Karena Carlson said early Thursday. \"We're just buttoning up a lot of our clay levees and putting a few more sandbags in place, and we hope to be protected up to 40 feet.\"  Several hundred volunteers worked with the National Guard in Fargo to fill those sandbags as the river rose.  Flooding where you are? Share pictures, video  Fargo set a record in 2009 when the Red River hit 40.8 feet. As of 9:15 a.m. Saturday, the river stood at 36.56 feet, more than 18 feet above the flood stage of 18 feet and past major flood stage.  \"Fortunately, we started filling sandbags March 1st. We thought our crest was going to be the first or second week in April. It turns out our crest is going to be this week,\" Carlson said. \"So we did it in just over two weeks.\"  Floodwaters are forecast to peak at 38 feet Sunday afternoon.  Last week, warm weather and rain melted snow south of Fargo and Moorhead, Minnesota, causing the Red River to swell. Upstream, snow and ice have yet to melt, causing water to accumulate near the two cities.  Across the river in Moorhead, Tom Holmgren spent Wednesday filling sandbags as Minnesota State University gave students time off to help with the effort.  \"Most of my friends have put in at least a couple hours,\" said Holmgren, who said sandbagging has become a source of college pride. \"I know there's a big push in just the college community that's like, 'Yeah, we're doing it. We're saving this town.'\"  One man refuses to leave his home  About 90 miles south of Fargo in Browns Valley, Minnesota, Kathryn Bartz said Thursday that she's grateful that a 40-year water diversion project is nearly complete.  \"Otherwise I believe we would have washed out a considerable amount of our town,\" said Bartz, a former town council member.  Browns Valley suffered severe flooding from the winding Little Minnesota River in 2007, 1993 and 1943, and lesser floods many other years. Funding and property acquisition problems kept the diversion project -- consisting mainly of a canal to carry overflow around the town -- from being completed, Bartz said.  A section of a new road that is part of the project washed out this week, but boulders and rocks were put in place to prevent further erosion, said Bartz, 66, who owns a hobby ranch outside of town.  \"That will be repaired when the water goes down,\" she said. \"It's an inconvenience, but we are grateful that it has worked as well as it has.\"  Meanwhile, in the Northeast, utility crews made steady progress restoring electricity after a nor'easter -- a powerful low-pressure system -- blasted the region over the weekend.  About 40,000 customers in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut remained without power early Thursday, down from a peak of more than 500,000.  \"We recognize the hardship our customers face from being without power for days,\" said Jeff Butler, president of Connecticut Light & Power. \"We appreciate everyone's patience as we continue to safely restore power as quickly as possible.\"  The outages were caused mostly by power lines downed by Saturday's hurricane-force winds, which knocked over trees and utility poles. At least seven deaths were attributed to the storm, authorities said.

{"article": " -- The Arkansas weatherman found last week in a hot tub alongside a man's lifeless, naked body is hoping autopsy results and other evidence will soon clear his name, his lawyer said Monday.  Mark Hampton said his client, Brett Cummins, resigned Friday from his position as a meteorologist at KARK, which is based in Little Rock.  \"The station was getting continuing inquiries, and Brett thought it would be best if he resigned,\" Hampton said, adding that the resignation was done orally after his client contacted the station.  In a statement on its website, KARK confirmed that Cummins' tenure at the station ended Friday afternoon.  Authorities have not charged him, or anyone else, in the death of Dexter Paul Williams, 24.  Christopher Barbour, 36, said he awoke Monday morning in his home outside Little Rock to find Williams' body at the bottom of an empty tub, his face blue and purple and a chain around his neck, a Maumelle Police Department report said.  Cummins, 33, was asleep next to the corpse, whose head was lying behind the meteorologist's shoulder, Barbour told police, according to a report by Officer Gregory Roussie. The witness said he awakened Cummins, who screamed and ran to the living room, where he vomited next to the couch after noticing Williams' discolored face and cold skin.  The previous night, Williams and Cummins arrived together at Barbour's house, Barbour told police. Once there, the three had drunk alcohol and snorted illegal narcotics, though Barbour could not identify the drugs, according to the report.  Last week, Williams' family issued a statement through their lawyer Thomas Nichols that said, \"Dex had a very loving but trusting heart. Anyone who knew him would agree that he was easily influenced.\"  Hampton had identified Williams as Cummins' friend, but on Monday the lawyer said that -- heeding his advice -- the weatherman had not contacted the dead man's family.  No arrests had been made, but an investigation is under way, Lt. Jim Hansard said last week. \"We don't have a crime -- yet,\" he said. \"That's part of the investigation.\"  Arkansas State Crime Laboratory Director Kermit Channell said Monday that Williams' autopsy examination \"should be finished up,\" anticipating that a final report will be ready \"in the next week or so.\" After that, it will up to the local law enforcement agency overseeing the case -- the Maumelle Police Department -- to decide whether the autopsy results will remain confidential or be released to the public, Channell said.

{"article": "SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (CNN) -- Search operations resumed Monday for six U.S. citizens missing since their small plane crashed Sunday evening off the north coast of Puerto Rico.  The U.S. Coast Guard found debris late Sunday night in the area where the single-engine Cessna 206 went down, half a nautical mile from the shoreline of the city of Quebradillas.  But despite five searches Sunday and two others throughout the night, rescue crews were not able to find the pilot or the five passengers from the plane, the Coast Guard said Monday.  Three searches are planned for Monday, said Coast Guard spokesman Ricardo Castrodad.  The private plane, chartered by Tropical Aviation Corp., took off from the Dominican Republic and was on its way to an airport in Puerto Rico when it went down Sunday evening, officials said.  Three male and two female passengers were returning to Puerto Rico after spending the weekend in the Dominican Republic, said Noemi Corporan, service manager for Tropical Aviation Corp. The passengers were San Juan residents and had flown to the Dominican Republic on Friday, she said.  Four HH-65 Dolphin helicopters from Coast Guard Air Station Borinquen and the Coast Guard Cutter Matinicus are taking part in the search, said spokesman Castrodad.  The airplane took off from Casa de Campo International Airport in the Dominican Republic and was supposed to land at the Luis Mu\u00f1oz Marin International Airport in Carolina to clear U.S. Customs before going on to the Isla Grande Airport in San Juan, the Coast Guard said.

{"article": "Hong Kong (CNN) -- She's traveled more than 35,000 kilometers hugging the equator, powered entirely by the sun.  PlanetSolar, the world's largest solar powered boat, recently stopped off in Hong Kong's Victoria Harbor as part of its 18-month journey around the world.  Measuring 31 meters (102 feet) long and 15 meters (49 feet) wide, the catamaran is powered by 537-square meters of photovoltaic solar panels.  On a sunny day they produce on average 94 kilowatts of power -- the equivalent to 127 horsepower.  Seventy-five percent of the energy propels the boat that travels between 5 and 10 knots an hour. The remainder is used for everything else from flushing toilets to operating the boat's navigational systems.  PlanetSolar is the brainchild of 39-year-old Swiss Raphael Domjan.  While hiking in Iceland, the former ambulance driver was alarmed to see how quickly the glaciers were melting and decided to find a novel way to raise awareness of global warming.  \"If we can go out on the road with this boat, it's a huge boat, only on solar energy, and we live on this boat, everything is working the computer, the telephone, everything is on solar energy. It means everyone can use solar and renewable energy at home everyday,\" Domjan said.  Built in Germany at the cost of $26 million dollars, this vessel tracks the sun thanks to state-of-the-art solar technology.  \"We can travel around three days with no light,\" explains Christian Ochsenbein, chief engineer aboard the boat.  \"But usually there is light everyday even if it's raining. So when we come in a bad weather situation we can expand this time, we reduce this speed and we sail for about 5 days before we run out of battery,\" he added.  Planet Solar set sail from Monaco in September 2010 crossing the Atlantic, the Panama Canal and is currently in the Pacific. Next stop is Singapore.  It will then travel across the Indian Ocean and the Suez Canal before finally returning to the Mediterranean where it plans to dock back in Monaco in May next year.  French captain, Erwann Le Rouzic (one of six crew members on board), says that while the technology has been faultless, Mother Nature has proven to be a challenge.  \"When you cross to the south of the planet you always find rain, strong winds and big waves, so we passed all this with lots of patience and humility, because you are always humble against bad weather,\" Le Rouzic explains.  In every port, the catamaran and its message has been warmly received. It's hoped the shipping industry -- responsible for 5% of global greenhouse gas emissions, according to the United Nations -- embraces this technology the same way the public has.  \"One day we won't have any more oil anywhere. Maybe it's in 50,100, 200 years but one day we will have no more oil and we'll have to find another way to live,\" Domjan said.  And if Planet Solar completes its mission, the crew says that will be proof that the sun, and solar power, is the answer.", "Q": ["Q: What was the reason for PlanetSolar to stops off in Hong Kong?

{"article": "NEW YORK (CNN) -- While President Obama takes plenty of heat over his plans to overhaul domestic policies, critics have also taken aim at his foreign policy approach, particularly as it relates to human rights around the globe.  Human Rights Watch advocacy director Tom Malinowski says Obama should have met with the Dalai Lama.  Human Rights Watch advocacy director Tom Malinowski said Wednesday that while the administration appeared to have \"gotten the balance right\" on Myanmar, the military junta-ruled Asian nation formerly known as Burma, by starting a dialogue while maintaining sanctions, \"China is a different matter.\"  \"And that's where we've seen the tension play out in the most acute way, with several signals that have been sent suggesting that the administration is putting human rights issues to one side,\" Malinowski said on CNN's \"Amanpour.\" \"And most recently, the, I think, symbolic mistake of the president declining to meet the Dalai Lama before his own visit to China later next month.\"  Watch the discussion \u00bb  The Tibetan spiritual leader, who fled to India in 1959 and established a government in exile there, visited the United States earlier this month.  China considers Tibet a renegade province and accuses the Dalai Lama of inciting violence.  The timing of a presidential meeting with the Dalai Lama is considered largely symbolic, and Malinowski said the president's delay \"sent a message to the Chinese government that perhaps this isn't as high a priority for the United States as it has been in the past.\"  Malinowski also criticized the U.S. special envoy to Sudan, retired Air Force Maj. J. Scott Gration, who had suggested wooing the Sudanese government with \"cookies\" and \"gold stars, smiley faces, handshakes, agreements, talk, engagement\" to change its attitude about Darfur, where genocide and famine have killed hundreds of thousands of people.  \"It's a really dumb thing to say,\" said Malinowski, who previously served in the administration of President Clinton.  \"Governments like this, they are not children, and they do not react to cookies and gold stars,\" he said. \"They act on their interests, and historically, as you know from Bosnia, to all the places where we have successfully defeated this kind of violence, governments respond to pressure.\"  Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir, a candidate for re-election next year, has been indicted on war-crimes charges by the International Criminal Court. Despite Gration's comments, the Obama administration has not yet articulated a Sudan policy.  But Louise Arbour, president of the International Crisis Group and a former U.N. human rights commissioner, told \"Amanpour\" that talking rather than pressuring governments over human rights can be beneficial.  \"If you have a policy of engagement, which I think very much is the one put forward by the Obama administration, you may give an impression that you're softening,\" said Arbour, who is also a former war crimes prosecutor. \"It's very easy to look tough, right? You don't talk to anybody, you repudiate everything, you slam all the doors and you accomplish nothing, or very little. And we have a lot of precedence for that.  \"When you have a policy of reinforcing diplomatic initiatives, engagement, it may look soft, because you have to put on the table a multiplicity of issues, not just a single one. But on balance, I think there's more chance on some of these... all important initiatives than just by looking tough and achieving nothing.\"  Arbour added, however, that the engagement approach to human rights abuses will not create fast change from the abusive regimes.  Noting the glacial pace of transformation in Myanmar, where democracy advocate Aung San Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, has been held under house arrest for nearly two decades, Arbour said \"it's going to be very slow.\"  \"You can't have 20 years of extremely adversarial, confrontational posturing, and then say, well, we're ready to talk and be friendly, and assume that the other side's going to roll over,\" she said. \"It's just not going to work that way.\"  \"There have to be very slow processes, but I think Aung San Suu Kyi herself has been encouraging more engagement. She wants to have contact with the junta and with foreigners, and it's happening. These are small steps.

{"article": " -- October 6, 1981, remains etched in the minds of Egyptians who witnessed the assassination of President Mohamed Anwar al-Sadat at the hands of four military officers during an annual parade celebrating the anniversary of Egypt's 1973 war with Israel.  In 1979, Sadat signed the Camp David peace treaty with Israel that won him the Nobel Peace Prize and the fury of many Arabs who accused him of betraying their cause.  In a tribute to the former \"hero of war and peace,\" as the inscription on his grave reads, Egyptian State TV ran footage Thursday of the assassination, depicting the moment Sadat stood in the pavilion saluting his killers while they fired at him as French Mirage fighters screeched over the parade grounds as part of the festivities.  Khaled El Islambouly, the lead gunman, was captured and executed.  Sadat's bullet-riddled body was rushed to the Maadi Military Hospital and the president was proclaimed dead at 2.40 p.m. due to \"intense nervous shock and internal bleeding in the chest cavity.\"  Talaat El Sadat, a former member of parliament and the nephew of the slain president, recalls the details of that grim day.  \"The president thought the killers were part of the show when they approached the stands firing, so he stood saluting them,\" El Sadat told CNN.  El Sadat claims his uncle refused to wear bulletproof vests and always confidently argued, \"I am among my sons.\"  An investigation uncovered evidence that the killers had plotted the attack with Al Gamaa al-Islamiyya, a Muslim Brotherhood offshoot that had failed ambitions of launching an Islamic revolution in the mid-1980s.  Aboud El Zomor, the leader of Al Gamaa al-Islamiyya, was convicted of plotting the assassination and spent almost 30 years behind bars before his release in April, among hundreds of political prisoners detained during President Hosni Mubarak's regime.  Three decades later, in his first interview with a U.S. television news organization since his release, El Zomor was unapologetic about being a part of the killing of Sadat.  \"Our role was related to assisting but not decision-making,\" El Zomor recalled in his interview with CNN. \"All that we did, our role, is that we had ammunition that we sent\" to the assassins.  \"The idea was just to change and provide an alternative leader who could save Egypt from a crisis of the political dead-end we lived in then,\" El Zomor explained. \"I intended complete change, not just the murder of Sadat.\"  He cheered the January 25 revolution that ousted Mubarak on February 11 and felt \"jealous\" that his own religious revolution did not succeed. He also claimed that Al Gamaa al-Islamiyya has renounced its military arm because there was \"no need to fight the oppression of the former Mubarak regime.\"  The fall of regimes almost always comes with the unveiling of secret documents and conspiracy theories.  Sadat's assassination was recently revisited by his daughter, Roqaya al-Sadat, a month after Mubarak was toppled. She filed a case in March at the general prosecutor's office claiming new evidence had emerged implicating Mubarak, who was Sadat's vice president.  \"The lead gunman's machine gun jammed and he reached in the vehicle for another gun,\" said Talaat El Sadat. He demands an explanation to how guns without their safety pins were smuggled in.  \"Where was my uncle's elite security all this time?\"  \"The answer (to all of this) is Hosni Mubarak. He benefits the most from the killing, assisted by the Americans and the Israelis,\" El Sadat said.  Meanwhile, the peace with Israel that Sadat worked relentlessly to achieve may be at the brink of collapse.  Anti-Israeli sentiment in Egypt in the past few months has been its most violent since the times of Sadat, as highlighted by the pro-democracy protesters who breached the Israeli Embassy on September 9.  The same protesters who brought down the Mubarak regime insist on ending the exports of gas to Israel and many call for the cancellation of the Camp David Peace Treaty after an incident on the Israeli-Egyptian border left five Egyptian soldiers dead.", "Q": ["Q: What has deteriorated this year?

{"article": "Editor's note: The staff at CNN.com has recently been intrigued by the journalism of VICE, an independent media company and website based in Brooklyn, New York. VBS.TV is Vice's broadband television network. The reports, which are produced solely by VICE, reflect a transparent approach to journalism, where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process. We believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our CNN.com readers.  Brooklyn, New York (VBS.TV) -- Whenever someone at our office bitches about being overworked, our stock response is \"Beats digging ditches.\"  While the express intention of the statement is usually not-so-supportive, we think it's a healthy reminder that at the end of the day, we are all basically professional e-mailers and should be thankful for such.  The wildland firefighters who work for Grayback Forestry in Medford, Oregon, have no such motivational adages because their job is actually digging ditches. Around active forest fires. On the sides of mountains. You can't even bitch at these guys for having cushy government pensions to fall back on when they get older, because they're all private-sector contractors. Which means if they aren't out fighting forest fires or doing preventative forestry on unburned woods (basically extreme landscaping), they are losing money. They are the hardest working men in the tree business.  Southern Oregon in the summer is a tinderbox. Last year the state recorded some 560 wild fires, the majority of which occurred in the seemingly endless sea of trees running across its bottom from the Cascades to the Pacific Coast. Humidity is next to nonexistent, which is extremely pleasant, but means that even an errant spark from a chainsaw or the proverbial cigarette butt out the car window can set the entire region ablaze.  Flying into the Rogue Valley, there is evidence of past wild fires is everywhere: From the miles-long scar of the 2002 \"Biscuit\" fire stretching past the horizon, to the smaller pockets of charred trees crowding the edge of towns to the blue Wilderness-Firefighter-ribbon bumper stickers flying past on the I-5 to the elaborate wildfire and firefighter shrines at a local bar.  See more of Oregon Fire Lines at VBS.TV  There are very few places firemen aren't revered as local heroes, but the wilderness firefighters of Oregon go past people simply risking their lives to help others into a crazy superhero realm where their work regularly prevents entire settlements from being destroyed. They're literally the guardians of their communities. Incidentally, their work is also very beneficial for the forest.  We spent a few days following a crew of Grayback forest-firefighters walk up the sides of what most people would consider a cliff, to chop down underbrush in preparation for a controlled burn. This is what they like to call \"project work\" -- the light stuff they do between fires. The work is the hardest and least rewarding work we have ever tried to do. Unless you consider 12-hour-plus shifts of backbreaking labor, virtually zero outside recognition, and occasional accusations of being shills for the timber industry rewards. Which we do not.

{"article": " -- The rivalry is so intense that Barnes & Noble actually spoke its competitor's name:  \"Kindle Fire is deficient for a media tablet,\" Barnes & Noble CEO William Lynch said as he unveiled his company's Nook Tablet on Monday. \"Content will render better on Nook than on Kindle Fire.\"  That jab essentially re-opened the fight between Barnes & Noble and Amazon over customers looking for digital-book-reading devices. Round I in this donnybrook was between the Nook and Kindle e-readers.  Next week, however, both companies will put their next-generation tablets on the market, setting up a new battle for holiday shoppers looking for gadgets that are good for reading books, watching videos and browsing the Internet.  Here's a quick comparison of the devices, which are called the Nook Tablet and Kindle Fire.

{"article": "Kansas City, Missouri (CNN) -- Deborah Bradley appeared calm and joyful just hours before her baby daughter was reported missing, according to a supermarket clerk who sold her baby wipes, baby food and boxed wine.  \"She had a smile on her face, like she always does when she comes in here,\" said clerk Rebecca Guerrero, whom FBI agents interviewed Saturday about conversations she'd had with Bradley.  Surveillance video recorded at a grocery store on October 3 shows Bradley and a man purchasing the items from Guerrero the day before 11-month-old Lisa Irwin was reported missing.  Police, who were joined in their search effort by federal authorities last week, have said they have no suspects or solid leads in Lisa's disappearance.  In an exclusive interview with CNN, Guerrero described the FBI agents' questions.  \"They pretty much asked me if she was depressed,... how she acted around the baby, if she seemed stressed out,\" Guerrero said. \"I told them she never looked depressed around me. You know, she always seemed to have a smile on her face when her kids were around.\"  Bradley and the girl's father, Jeremy Irwin, are friendly people who were thrilled to have a baby daughter, Guerrero said.  \"When they're here, they're happy. They're smiling. They love their kids,\" she said.  After two years chatting with Bradley in the checkout line at Festival Foods in Kansas City, Missouri, Guerrero said she had learned a lot about the family.  \"We would just pretty much talk about what they've been doing, stuff like that; the children, her two sons, and then when she found out she was pregnant with Lisa, that's all we talked about,\" Guerrero said.  The supermarket clerk said she also told FBI agents Lisa's parents never mentioned anyone wanting to harm them.  \"From my interaction (with the parents), I really don't think that they have anything to do with this,\" she told CNN.  Authorities had expressed frustration recently after Lisa's parents had stopped cooperating with investigators, police Capt. Steve Young said. However, a family spokeswoman for Bradley and father Jeremy Irwin attributed the frustration to \"miscommunication,\" and a subsequent meeting with the parents was held Saturday.  On Tuesday, Irwin's family announced they had brought in a prominent private investigator to help with the search -- a high-profile twist in a case that has gripped national headlines.  Flanked by family members wearing T-shirts with a picture of Lisa and the word \"Kidnapped\" above it, investigator Bill Stanton said Tuesday night that he wants a \"happy ending\" to the case.  He told CNN a family friend was paying for his services.  \"I will be asking questions,\" he added. \"I am here to seek the truth.\"  Stanton is a former New York City police officer who has served as a security consultant for several television networks. He said his role is to help \"coordinate and focus the family\" in both the investigation and in its dealings with the media.  \"We are here to cooperate with anyone and everyone that will help us find the guilty party and return Lisa home safely,\" he said.  Stanton said the family, which remains united and strong despite the \"tremendous hardship,\" will release more information soon. He did not elaborate.  \"I know everybody's watching this family and watching this house, and that's fair,\" he said. \"Keep one eye on them, but also keep the other eye out on the streets, in every place. Because there is a bad guy out there, or bad people, with this child. And we want to get this child home safe and sound.\"  Lisa was last seen around 10:30 p.m. October 3, asleep in her crib, police said. Authorities were called to the home about 4 a.m. October 4.  She turned 11 months old Tuesday, the eighth day of the search.  On Tuesday, authorities focused on an abandoned home about a half mile from the Irwin home, and included an inspection of a well in the backyard of the property.  The search did not yield any evidence, police said. Authorities had previously combed a nearby landfill and creek.  \"It appears the suspect entered/exited through a bedroom window,\" authorities said in a statement. \"Evidence at the scene leads police to believe the child has been abducted.\"  Lisa's father, Jeremy Irwin, told reporters that he discovered the girl was missing when he got home from work.  \"The front door was unlocked,\" he said last week. \"Most of the lights were on in the house, and the window in front was open -- all very unusual.\"  Three cell phones were also reported missing at the home, Young said.  Lisa is described as 30 inches tall with blue eyes and blond hair, police said. She weighs between 26 and 30 pounds and was last seen wearing purple shorts and a purple shirt with white kittens on it.  The missing girl has two bottom teeth and a \"beauty mark\" on her right outer thigh. She had a cold with a cough, police said.

{"article": "(Mental Floss) -- In his victory speech on Tuesday night, Barack Obama promised his daughters Sasha and Malia that they'd get to bring a new puppy with them to the White House in January.  President Bush's dog Barney, left, plays in 2001 with Spot, the offspring of George H.W. Bush's dog Millie.  It's a good thing Obama said \"Yes, we can\" to the girls' request to getting a dog; for all of his charm, ability, and oratorical flair, he could never be our nation's chief executive without a White House pet.  Counting Obama, the country has had 44 Presidents, and only two of them -- Chester A. Arthur and Franklin Pierce -- left no record of having pets.  Like Obama himself, the family pooch will have some big shoes to fill. Previous White House pets have set the bar pretty high. iReport.com: What pet would you want if you lived in the White House?  Here are a few of our favorites:  Watch Obama on \"mutts like me\" \u00bb  1. Billy: Calvin Coolidge's pygmy hippopotamus  Calvin Coolidge may have been known for his reticence, but he showed little of his trademark reserve when it came to acquiring pets.  After taking over the presidency upon the death of Warren G. Harding, Coolidge assembled a menagerie that would rival most zoos' collections.  He had six dogs, a bobcat, a goose, a donkey, a cat, two lion cubs, an antelope, and a wallaby. The main attraction in his personal zoo, though, was Billy, a pygmy hippopotamus.  Watch new baby pygmy hippo \u00bb  Billy was born in Liberia, but was captured at a young age.  He came into the possession of tire mogul Harvey Firestone, who gave Billy to President Coolidge as a gift, possibly because Firestone didn't want to feed the critter. (Even a pygmy hippo is still quite rotund; Billy was six feet long and weighed upwards of 600 pounds.)  Coolidge donated Billy to the Smithsonian National Zoological Park. Because there were only a handful of pygmy hippos in the U.S. at the time, Billy quickly went to work as a stud, an endeavor at which he found some success.  He sired 23 little hippos, and many of the pygmy hippos you see in American zoos today are his offspring. Mental Floss: 7 crafty zoo escapes  2. The White House gators  Herbert Hoover wanted to put a chicken in every pot, a car in every garage, and... a gator in the Oval Office? It's true.  Hoover owned a slew of dogs, but those weren't his only pets. His second son, Allan Henry Hoover, owned a pair of gators that were occasionally allowed to wander around the White House grounds.  Sound crazy? Blame John Quincy Adams for setting the precedent. The sixth president also had a pet gator. His was a gift from the Marquis de Lafayette; it lived in a bathroom in the East Room of the White House. According to some reports, he enjoyed using the gator to scare his guests.  3. Fala: FDR's traveling companion  What do you get the Depression-conquering president who has everything? A lapdog.  In 1940 Franklin Roosevelt received a Scottish Terrier puppy named Big Boy as an early Christmas gift from a family friend.  FDR immediately realized that Big Boy was no name for a presidential companion and rechristened the pooch Murray the Outlaw of Falahill, after a Scottish ancestor. For the sake of simplicity, though, he called his new pal Fala.  After that, Fala became FDR's inseparable companion and traveled everywhere the President went.  The dog \"gave\" $1 a day to the war effort, generosity that earned him the rank of honorary private in the Army. Each morning when FDR's breakfast tray came in, it included a bone for Fala.  Fala also made a famous appearance in one of his master's speeches. When FDR was decrying personal attacks from his political opponents, he jokingly said that it was okay to mock him, but leave Fala alone.  \"You know, Fala is Scotch, and being a Scottie, as soon as he learned that the Republican fiction writers in Congress and out had concocted a story that I had left him behind on the Aleutian Islands and had sent a destroyer back to find him -- at a cost to the taxpayers of two or three, or eight or 20 million dollars -- his Scotch soul was furious.  \"He has not been the same dog since!\"  Fala stayed with FDR until the President's death in 1945 and lived in the care of Eleanor Roosevelt until his death in 1952. Mental Floss: 6 utterly loyal dogs  4. Millie: Literary sensation  When George H.W. Bush took office in 1989, he brought his pet springer spaniel Millie to the White House.  The bubbly canine won over the nation's heart so completely that she even collaborated with the First Lady on Millie's Book: As Dictated to Barbara Bush.  Millie brought further joy to the Bush family when she gave birth to a litter of six presidential puppies in 1989.  Just as her master helped slip one of his boys into the White House, so did Millie: when George W. Bush moved into the Oval Office, so did his dog, Millie's son Spot Fetcher.  5. Barney, Miss Beazley & India: The current residents  Sadly, Spot Fetcher had to be put down in 2004, but the Bushes aren't pet-deprived now.  They have a pair of Scottish Terriers named Barney and Miss Beazley, both of whom have websites and appear in White House-produced web videos. (Your tax dollars adorably at work!) The Bushes also have a black cat named India, who also goes by \"Willie.\"  Watch Barney bite a reporter \u00bb  The name India rankled some citizens of the country of the same name to the point that many Indians supposedly named their dogs \"Bush.\"  The name wasn't meant to be controversial, though; the Bushes merely named their cat after Ruben \"El Indio\" Sierra, who played for the Texas Rangers while George W. owned the team. Spot Fetcher was similarly named after former Rangers middle infielder Scott Fletcher.  Other first pets of note:  Mr. Reciprocity and Mr. Protection -- Benjamin Harrison's two opossums. Harrison's son Russell also had a pet goat named Old Whiskers.  Pauline -- The last cow to live at the White House. She made milk for President Taft's consumption.  Old Ike -- To save cash during World War I, Woodrow Wilson brought in a flock of sheep to take care of the White House's groundskeeping duties. Old Ike, a ram, supposedly chewed tobacco.  Laddie Boy -- Warren G. Harding's beloved Airedale who had his own seat at Cabinet meetings and gave a 1921 \"interview\" with The Washington Post in which he talked about Prohibition and shortening the workday for guard dogs.  Liberty -- Gerald Ford's golden retriever hung out in the Oval Office and could supposedly read a sign from Ford that she should go be affectionate to guests -- a cute and cuddly way to gracefully end the President's conversations.  Socks and Buddy -- President Clinton's faithful cat and the chocolate lab he acquired while in office. Socks didn't like Buddy's youthful friendliness, so the two pets had to be kept separated at all times. The tensions were so bad that the family couldn't keep both pets at the end of Bill's second term, so Socks went to live with Clinton's secretary, Betty Currie.  Gamecocks -- Ulysses S. Grant supposedly kept some gamecocks at the White House.  Two tiger cubs -- Martin Van Buren received the cats as a gift from the Sultan of Oman. Congress supposedly made him give the gift to a zoo.  Satan -- One of Abigail Adams' unfortunately named dogs. She called the other one Juno.  Jonathan Edwards -- Theodore Roosevelt received this black bear cub as a gift from supporters in West Virginia who gave the bear the name, he wrote to a friend, \"partly because they thought they detected Calvinistic traits in the bear's character.\"  Dr. Johnson, Bishop Doane, Fighting Bob Evans, and Father O'Grady -- Teddy Roosevelt's kids also had these tremendously named guinea pigs.  Josiah -- Roosevelt also had a pet badger, of course.  Bonus trivia: Checkers  Nixon's dog was immortalized in the \"Checkers speech,\" which Nixon gave while facing allegations of illegal campaign contributions.  He said the only gift he'd accepted was a cocker spaniel named Checkers for his daughters. Mental Floss: Why was the 'Checkers speech' so important?  Checkers, however, was never the White House dog. This scandal bubbled up while Nixon was Eisenhower's running mate in the 1952 election, and Nixon gave the Checkers speech to convince Republicans to keep him on the ticket.  Although the speech was a success and Nixon later made it to the White House, Checkers never got to be First Dog; he passed away in 1964.

{"article": " -- A union representing thousands of transit workers went on strike early Tuesday in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, shutting down buses, subways and trolleys that carry almost a million people daily.  Transport Workers Union leaders walked out of contract talks just before midnight, saying they couldn't accept an offer from the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority because of a shortfall in their pension fund and disagreements on some work rule issues.

{"article": "MIAMI, Florida (CNN)  -- An internationally known Catholic priest who was shown in photographs last week embracing a bathing-suit-clad woman on a Florida beach has admitted they had a two-year affair.  The Rev. Alberto Cutie was removed from his duties after pictures showed him bare-chested with a woman.  The Rev. Alberto Cutie -- sometimes called \"Father Oprah\" because of the advice he gave on Spanish-language media -- said Monday on CBS' \"Early Show\" that he is in love with the woman and is considering his options: Whether to break up with her or leave the priesthood and marry her. The woman, who has not been publicly identified, wants to get married, Cutie said.  The priest was removed from his duties last week at St. Francis De Sales Catholic Church in Miami Beach, Florida, and on the Radio Paz and Radio Peace networks.  \"I take full responsibility for what I did, and I know it's wrong,\" he said Monday.  The photos of the Cuban-American priest, also known as \"Padre Alberto,\" appeared on the cover of last week's TV Notas magazine and on eight inside pages. The cover says in Spanish: \"Good God! Padre Alberto. First photos of a priest 'in flagrante' with his lover.\"  Other media outlets throughout Latin America, including the official Notimex news agency in Mexico, picked up the story, and it became an Internet sensation. Cutie has millions of followers in the Spanish-speaking world.  In a message posted on the Miami, Florida, archdiocese Web page last week, Archbishop John C. Favalora apologized to parishioners and radio listeners for what he called a \"scandal.\"  \"Father Cutie made a promise of celibacy and all priests are expected to fulfill that promise with the help of God,\" Favalora said. \"Father Cutie's actions cannot be condoned despite the good works he has done as a priest.\"  Cutie expressed his regret in an online statement last week and again Monday on the CBS program.  \"I deeply apologize to the Catholic community and especially to my bishop and to my brother priests who are faithful and who are committed to celibacy,\" Cutie said.  The priest said he believes in celibacy but thinks it should be optional. He said he had never had a sexual relationship with anyone other than the woman since leaving the seminary 15 years ago.  Watch Father Cutie question the celibacy requirement \u00bb  \"I don't support the breaking of the celibacy promise,\" Cutie said. \"I understand fully that this is wrong.  \"I don't want to be the anti-celibacy priest. I think that's unfortunate,\" he said. \"I think it's a debate that's going on in our society, and now I've become kind of a poster boy for it. But I don't want to be that. I believe that celibacy is good, and that it's a good commitment to God. This is something I've struggled with. And something that I never expected to become a public debate.\"  He also talked about the woman, saying they have been friends for a long time and the attraction was there from early on, but it was not acted on until a couple of years ago. They have \"both struggled\" with the relationship, he said.  \"She's also a woman of faith,\" Cutie said. \"She's also somebody who cares about the priesthood, who cares about these things. So it hasn't been easy. And those who have helped me through this process know it hasn't been easy. Obviously, you know, through the photos, it looked like a frivolous thing on the beach, you know, and that's not what it is. It's something deeper than that.\"  Cutie was the first Catholic priest to host a daily talk show on a major secular television network, his information on the LinkedIn online professional network says.  In addition to his TV and radio appearances, he has written newspaper advice columns and a self-help book, \"Real Life, Real Love.\"  Before being removed, he was president and general director of Pax Catholic Communications, home of Radio Paz and Radio Peace in Miami.", "Q": ["Q: Who was removed from duties?

{"article": " -- Sonia, a single mother with HIV in Brazil, travels four hours to reach a government-run health facility that provides her with free drug treatment.  Brazil's response to the HIV/AIDS fight has been widely praised and adopted as a model around the world.  The journey is long, she told CNN, but it's a small price to pay for the government-provided drugs that have helped keep her out of the hospital for the past 11 years.  Sonia is just one of the many Brazilians who have benefited from the country's novel approach to fighting the HIV/AIDS epidemic.  Brazil jolted the global health community in 1996 when it began guaranteeing free anti-retroviral treatment to HIV/AIDS patients.  For Sonia, government-funded treatment comes in the form of 20 pills. Taken daily, the anti-retroviral medicine has helped keep her HIV at bay.  Coupled with government-supported prevention efforts and aggressive public awareness campaigns, the so-called Brazilian response has been hailed as a model for developing countries.  Watch a report on Brazil's pioneering response to HIV/AIDS \u00bb  Prevention campaigns, which often take the forms of candid public awareness ads with slogans like \"Be good in bed, use a condom,\" have resulted in widespread knowledge of HIV.  According to a recent study conducted by the country's Ministry of Health, Brazil boasts one of the highest rates of knowledge globally when it comes to HIV avoidance and transmittal.  Brazil was \"the first country to realize there is no separation between prevention and treatment,\" Mauro Schechter, professor of infectious diseases at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, told CNN.  Schechter, who has studied the HIV/AIDS epidemic since 1989, said it took the rest of the global health community some 15 years to realize that the two go hand-in-hand.  Other countries that have adopted the Brazilian model \u00bb  The comprehensive response has extended the lives of tens of thousands of Brazilians and saved the government billions, researchers estimate.  A recent study published by researchers from Brown University and the Harvard School of Public Health said that Brazil has saved $1 billion alone by producing its own generic versions of HIV/AIDS medicines and negotiating discounts for imported drugs.  Those drug savings come on top of the estimated $2 billion the program has saved Brazil in hospital costs between 1996 and 2004.  Brazil's efforts to reverse the tide of the AIDS epidemic have become the object of admiration in the global health community, but the trailblazer is encountering new challenges.  When Brazil decided to guarantee free anti-retrovirals, there were 10,000 people being treated and it was organized as a program to treat a small amount of people for a limited amount of time, according to Schechter.  Patients are living longer and oftentimes able to get their disease under control, thanks to combination therapies, better known as drug cocktails. But that means they also require drug treatment for a longer period of time.  Furthermore, as HIV has evolved from an acute illness into a chronic disease, patients have also become vulnerable to other health risks and medical conditions.  Valdileia Veloso is the director of the Institute of Clinical Research at the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, a public health research institution in Rio de Janeiro.  She told CNN patients are presenting with complications of chronic HIV and AIDS, which requires new treatment. \"It's a new challenge for us,\" she said.  Heart disease is one of the big problems that doctors are encountering. While there's a system in place to prevent people from dying from HIV, preventable causes like heart conditions are causing deaths.  \"These people are dying from preventable causes,\" Schechter told CNN.  While Brazil has shown that providing universal access to treatment can be achieved, it needs to modify its approach to treat the evolving disease, he said. \"If the epidemic changes face, you need to adapt.\"", "Q": ["Q: what is happening in brazil A:", "Q: what country has been hailed as a leader in the fight against the HIV/AIDS epidemic?

Video captured in Austin, Texas, shows a meteor-like object in the sky Sunday morning.  There were no reports of ground strikes or interference with aircraft in flight, FAA spokesman Roland Herwig said.  Herwig told CNN the FAA received no reports from pilots in the air of any sightings but the agency recieved \"numerous\" calls from people on the ground from Dallas, Texas, south to Austin, Texas.  Video shot by a photographer from News 8 TV in Austin showed what appeared to be a meteor-like white fireball blazing across a clear blue sky Sunday morning. The photographer caught the incident while covering a marathon in Austin.  On Saturday, the FAA told pilots through its routine notification system that \"a potential hazard may occur due to re-entry of satellite debris into the earth's atmosphere.\" The notice did not specify a time or location.

Calls to NORAD headquarters in Colorado were not immediately returned.  Lisa Block, spokeswoman for the Texas Department of Public Safety, said her agency had received calls from residents surprised by sonic booms about 11 a.m. She said calls came from an area from Dallas to Houston.

{"article": " -- It took about 110 years and some delicate surgery on his most private parts, but Henry -- a lizard-like creature from New Zealand -- is now a dad.  Henry, the oldest tuatara to mate at Southland Museum, enjoys a cold shower in his home in New Zealand.  Henry, a tuatara who, as far as curators at Southland Museum in New Zealand know, had never mated before, hooked up with Mildred, a younger woman of about 80, in March.  In July she laid 11 healthy eggs and, this week, all 11 of them hatched -- the last one on Wednesday.  \"Eleven out of eleven,\" curator Lindsay Hazley said Friday morning. \"Bloody brilliant. We had a champagne breakfast to celebrate.\"  Henry was the oldest tuatara ever to mate at the museum, on New Zealand's South Island, Hazley said.  Tuataras are the only living descendants of an order, related to dinosaurs, that flourished 200 million years ago. They're endangered, only living on a handful of islands in New Zealand, which makes Henry's happy news all the more important to supporters of the species.  But it didn't come easy.  Until about six years ago, Henry was a nasty, irritable fellow who showed no interest in mating and would attack females when they were introduced. Hazley, who has been breeding tuataras for the past 35 years, eventually had to put him in \"solitary confinement.\"  But in 2002, veterinarians discovered that a lump in Henry's nether regions was a cancerous tumor. They removed it and, over the next few years, his mood -- and interest in the ladies -- improved.  Now, Henry lives peacefully with Mildred and two other females. Breeders are hoping he'll show interest in Lucy, who is about the same age as Mildred, later this year. Female tuataras only lay eggs every two or three years, so Mildred likely won't be interested.  Watch a curator take care of the reproducing dinosaur kin \u00bb  Henry's newfound libido does have some limits, however. Hazley said Juliet, a youthful 22 year old, appears to be too hot to handle for the centenarian -- who could live to be 200 years old if he stays healthy.  \"I think he's a bit shy to mate with such a young woman,\" Hazley said. \"After a bit of experience with Mildred and Lucy, maybe he'll be interested in Juliet next year.\"  Maxing out at about two-and-a-half feet long, tuataras are much smaller than their ancestors.  The word \"tuatara\" is derived from a Maori word meaning \"spiny back.\" In Maori legend, they are messengers of Whiro, the god of death and disaster, and they were featured on one side of a New Zealand five-cent coin that was phased out in 2006.  It's been a baby boom at Southland Museum lately. Hazley said another 10 babies were born to another couple recently -- swelling the ranks of the 50 or so tuataras that were already there.  Friday morning, Hazley was working to install a camera so Henry's international fan base can watch him and other tuataras on the Internet. But they shouldn't expect any images of the proud dad playing with his batch of hatchlings.  \"If it's small and it moves, it's food,\" Hazley said. \"He'd have them for lunch.\"", "Q": ["Q: what did henry have removed A:", "Q: How many eggs did Henry and his near 80 year old mate Mildred produce?

{"article": "ISTANBUL, Turkey (CNN) -- Were nine attractive young Turkish women duped and imprisoned in a villa by Internet soft-core porn peddlers? Or did they simply call in the police to help them break their contract with an Internet contest similar to the reality TV show \"Big Brother\"?  A lawyer for the production company, Istanbul Group Electronic Trade Communications and Advertising A.S., is arguing the latter.  In a written statement on the company's Web site, Hilmi Tufan Cakir denied reports published in the Turkish and international media, that nine women were trapped against their will in an Istanbul villa, while cameras sold their images on the Internet.  \"My client organized a contest with reward money, contracts were signed with the contestant girls,\" the lawyer's statement said. \"In accordance with the contracts signed by the nine girls, this contest was to be broadcast on the Internet live.\"  But on Friday, an officer with a Turkish gendarme unit, told CNN that security forces raided the reality show's villa earlier this week, after they received a complaint.  \"We detained one person,\" said the gendarme officer, who asked not to be identified. \"There were eight or nine young girls, some younger then 18, who were returned to their families.\"  Turkish television showed footage of gendarme officers raiding the villa and detaining a suspect earlier this week.  The disputed Web-site is a page of hot pink graphics and photos of scantily clad young women, accompanied by throbbing dance music and the title, \"We Are at Home.\"  It shows video of the villa and its pool, and flashes photos of the nine female \"contestants\" as well as a list of ratings for viewers, who can vote for their favorite lady via cell phone text message. Audience members were also encouraged to send \"virtual gifts\" to the contestants, like pink panties, beer, chocolate and a pearl necklace.  Each resident of the house had their own introductory video. The women, dressed in mini-skirts and bikinis, pose by the villa's pool, dance around in revealing outfits, and introduce themselves to the camera.  In one segment, a hostess named Zeynep Karacan, who wears a long dress with a plunging neck line, reads from cue cards, introduces viewers to the house and its residents, who enter one-by-one waving to the camera and carrying luggage.  According to the Web site's rating system, the second most popular contestant was woman from the town of Kocaeli who went by the name \"Tugce.\" Text on the web-page said she was 18-years old, born on September 14th, 1990. But in her on-camera appearance, Tugce tells the audience \"I am 16.\"  She wears a purple bikini by the pool and goes on to say \"I came here to be discovered. My biggest dream is to be a model.\"  In Turkish press reports, the women said they signed contracts requiring them to pay fines of more then $30,000 if they left the show before it completed filming.  This is not the first time scandal has rocked the booming reality TV industry in Turkey.  In 2005, a male contestant from the hit show \"Would You Be My Bride?\" died of an apparent drug overdose after the season wrapped up production. On that show, mothers helped their sons choose a bride.

{"article": "Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN)  -- In the central plaza, there was once an orgy of music, street dancing and revelry unmatched by any other nation in the Americas, Haitians say.  But where there was joy now sits a vast settlement of people left without loved ones, without homes, without life's belongings.  Haitians have celebrated Carnival through dictatorships, military coups and bloodshed. Popular belief was that if a government failed to deliver on Carnival, Haiti's equivalent of Mardi Gras, it was sure to fall, said Marie Laurence Lassegue, Haiti's minister of culture and information.  But this year, the three-day festival has been canceled, another indication of the enormity of the earthquake's devastation.  Musicians fell silent, seamstresses stopped sewing costumes and ghostly skeletons of unfinished floats lay scattered on the outskirts of Port-au-Prince. A month after the devastating January 12 earthquake, the Champs de Mars plaza is home to the capital's displaced, where thousands of people have eked out a tiny space in which to survive.  Full coverage of the earthquake's aftermath  \"This is the first time Carnival is not happening,\" said Roberto Martino, lead singer of popular Kompa band T-Vice. \"I don't even think about music anymore.\"  Less than a week ahead of Carnival's start on Sunday, revelry is replaced with mourning. The nation's foremost concert producer, Charles Jubert, died. So did members of four bands who were practicing inside a studio that collapsed. Other musicians lost legs, arms and hands. They will not be able to play again.  \"I don't think we have time to think of Carnival,\" Lassegue said. \"Maybe when we are finished crying.\"  Carnival's three days of deliverance and celebration has tremendous importance in the lives of Haitians, Lassegue said. \"But this year? I don't even remember when it is.\"  Instead, the displaced are planning days of prayer.  \"We're living in a city that's like a cemetery,\" said Ronide Baduel, a nurse who lost her home and all her belongings in the quake. Her brother died and suddenly, she found herself far from her middle-class existence, relegated to a makeshift tent and burlap bags she uses for pillows at night.  \"I had four good walls around me. Now I have four sheets,\" she said. She goes to work with a big, black faux-leather purse containing toothpaste, soap and a change of underwear. There, she can bathe properly.  \"We don't know how many days, how many months, how long we will be this way,\" she said. \"I am always stressed. It's like living in a jungle. How can I dance at Carnival?\"  Baduel and her tent community neighbors said the money that would have been spent on Carnival ought to be used to build housing.  Nearby, the 44 members of Relax Band, who normally would be revving up their street performances in the days before Carnival, worried about their next meal.  They played the Sunday before the earthquake, marching through the streets, getting ready for the big performance. Now, everything was gone,\u00ad including all their instruments that were crushed when band coordinator Ernst Beauvais' house collapsed.  A small stage emblazoned with the red and white logo of Relax Band now harbors a massive water bladder tank dropped off by an aid group and a few mattresses for slumber under the stars.  \"It is one of the greatest tragedies to befall our country,\" Beauvais said, pointing to the rubble of his house. He said it was the street band's 30th anniversary; the musicians were looking forward to showcasing their new song. Almost every band in Haiti debuts new pieces at Carnival.  On the outskirts of town, the skeletons of three floats sit like ghosts, reminders of what might have come next week.  One of the floats belongs to T-Vice.  Bandmates Roberto Martino and Eddy Viau would have been practicing with the rest of the band for their Carnival performance \u00ad-- it's an honor to win top prize.  \"If you have a good showing at Carnival, you're set for the rest of the year,\" Martino said. This year, the band had planned a soccer-themed show with a song called \"The End of the Match.\"  Instead it recently released \"Nou Pap Lage'' (We Won't Give Up\"), dedicated to the victims of the earthquake.  iReport: Looking for loved ones in Haiti  Martino tried to sing a few verses. \"There are so many things going through my head,\" he said. Overcome by emotion, he had to compose himself and start again.  \"People are saying Haiti is finished, but no, no, no, we will rise up,'' he sang softly. \"We will strive. We will rebuild Haiti. We will stand united.\"  \"Don't be discouraged. There will be light at the end of the tunnel. My Haitian people. I will not let go.\"  Proceeds from downloads of the song are going to the nonprofit organizations Sow A Seed and MedShare. Music, Martino said, was so essential to Haitian life. But he didn't know when this rare silence would end; when he would be able to write lyrics, put them to melody.  \"We're all so traumatized,\" he said.

{"article": " -- The nation's new \"first dog\" has heightened interest in its breed -- Portuguese water dog -- but not necessarily a thorough understanding of the dogs' needs, a pair of owners and breeders told CNN.  Bo the Portuguese water dog meets the camera. Bo was a gift to the Obama girls from Sen. Ted Kennedy.  The dog, Bo, has triggered \"the most publicity the breed has ever had since its introduction into the U.S. in the late 1960s,\" the Portuguese Water Dog Club of America said in a news release.  President Obama and his family welcomed Bo into the White House this week. Shortly afterward, the club's Web site was receiving a million hits an hour, said Susan Teasley, a club member.  Jane Harding, a fellow member of the club, said she has \"received about a 10 percent increase in calls\" since Tuesday, and some of the other breeders she knows also have reported more calls.  \"Thankfully, people want to know more about the breed,\" Teasley said. \"But water dogs are not for everybody, and it would be sad to see people getting the dog without doing the proper research.\"  Portuguese water dogs are \"active athletes,\" far from couch potatoes, she explained.  In fact, they are more likely to rip a couch into pieces than lounge on it, Harding said, recalling a friend who had lost a sofa that way.  Watch more water dog fun \u00bb  Portuguese water dogs can be miserable and destructive when alone, Teasley said.  And don't think you can close the door and keep them out. \"They want to be with you at all times -- even if it's in the bathroom or your bed,\" she said.  Teasley and her husband breed Portuguese water dogs and often allow them to run free on the two and a half acres of land they own. They are \"not apartment dogs,\" she said.  Harding agreed. \"They aren't for people who want a tie-out dog or an apartment dog. For people like that,\" she joked, \"we recommend a stuffed dog.\"  Portuguese water dogs love the outdoors, particularly if they have a garden to eat from, Teasley said as she wrestled to keep 7-month-old Misty Morning from eating the family's flowers.  Harding said she believes the first family will be successful with their new dog because \"they have access to the best trainers, and they want to make this work.\"  For other Americans thinking about following suit, she cautioned, \"Buyers beware. Do your homework and first read the information on the breed.\"  Teasley wants people to understand the breed to help avoid what she called the \"Dalmatian syndrome.\"  After the movie \"101 Dalmatians\" came out in 1996, \"thousands of people rushed to get the dog, and thousands of dogs ended up in rescue kennels,\" Teasley said.  What those who followed the Dalmatian trend may not have known is that Dalmatians shed profusely and they develop hearing problems, making it hard to train and call them, she said.  Both Teasley and Harding advised owners to get a mentor, as they expect Sen. Ted Kennedy to be to the Obama family. Kennedy owns Portuguese water dogs himself and recommended the breed to the Obamas.  Watch Obamas introduce dog \u00bb  \"For the first six to seven months of the puppy's life, they need training,\" Harding said.  She has diligently trained 8-year-old champion Bessie, who she said \"produces phenomenal litters... and has multiple titles\" from the Portuguese Water Dog Club of America.  Such organizations provide guidance to first-time dog owners. But it takes time to get a membership, Teasley said. Prospective members must apply for a one-year associate membership before they can receive a permanent one, she explained. That provides a cushion while they decide whether the dog is the right fit.  \"It sounds like I'm trying to discourage people from getting (a Portuguese water dog),\" Teasley said, \"But I'm not.

{"article": "NEW YORK (CNN) -- For three years, family, friends and her college sorority sisters have been looking for Jennifer Kesse, wondering what happened to her.  Jennifer Kesse would be 26 now. She has been missing since January 24, 2006.  Last week, on the third anniversary of Kesse's disappearance, an inmate in a Florida prison said he might have the answer.  David Russ, a convicted killer being held at the Seminole County Jail, spoke last week with the missing woman's father, Drew Kesse, claiming he had information that could lead to a break in the case.  Details are being withheld from the public. In a jailhouse phone call with CNN, Russ hinted he'd eavesdropped on other inmates. He also was outspoken about his skepticism toward investigators.  \"The investigators have messed this case up from the beginning and cannot be trusted,\" he said. That's why he asked to speak directly with the missing woman's father, he said.  Orlando police are just as skeptical of Russ. They said he provided information they already had.  \"His information is not some big break in the case,\" said Sgt. Barbara Jones of the Orlando Police Department. \"We are still hoping for new tips that could lead us to finding Jennifer Kesse.\"  The 24-year-old financial adviser was just back from a Caribbean vacation with her boyfriend and was getting back into her routine. She went to work at her new job, came home to her new condominium and called her parents.  Watch an update on the case \u00bb  At 10 p.m., she called her boyfriend, who lived in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Then, her family believes, she went to bed.  The next morning, she got up and showered for work. Her clothes were neatly laid out on her bed, her family says, suggesting she may have tried on a few outfits before deciding what to wear to the office. Then, she disappeared, her family said.  She did not show up for work that Tuesday morning and her employer reported her missing.  Police found Kesse's Chevy Malibu two days later. It was parked in a gated lot about one mile down the road from the condominium complex where she lived. Inside the vehicle, police found some of Kesse's personal items, but her purse, wallet, two cell phones and briefcase were missing. The car doors were locked and the car keys were not found.  Police later released a video surveillance tape of the car being parked in the lot by someone other than Kesse.  The grainy video partially shows a person walking away from the car, past a parking lot gate. Police are uncertain if this person of interest is a man or a woman, because the image is partially obscured by the gate.  The person is described as 5 feet 4 inches, with a short haircut, wearing light-colored clothes and dark shoes. The video is time and date-stamped at noon on the day Kesse disappeared.  Forensic tests on the vehicle came back inconclusive, Sgt. Jones said. No blood or other trace evidence was found to show that Kesse had been injured in the vehicle.  Drew Kesse said that every Tuesday, landscapers worked at the condo complex near his daughter's parking space. The landscapers said they didn't see Kesse leaving her apartment and getting into her car, which she did every weekday morning between 7:30 and 7:45 a.m.  \"The only theory we could come up with is that she walked out her front door and was kidnapped somewhere between her front door and the parking lot where her car was. We think since the landscapers didn't see her, she must not have even made it out of the hallways or stairwells of the condo complex,\" Drew Kesse said.  He added that there weren't any surveillance cameras in the hallways or stairwells at the time his daughter was living there.  Sgt. Jones said investigators have developed forensic evidence from Kesse's car that could someday match with a person of interest and identify a suspect. Police have also released a photo of a green clover tattoo on Kesse's left hip.  Anyone with information leading to Jennifer Kesse or the person responsible for her disappearance is asked to call the tip line at 1-800-423-TIPS. The reward is $10,000. Kesse would be 26 years old and has blonde hair, green eyes, is 5 feet 8 inches tall and weighs 125 pounds.", "Q": ["Q: Who called the father/ A:", "Q: What amount of money is offered as a reward?

{"article": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- He's been a homicidal singing barber in \"Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street\" and a drunken swashbuckler in \"Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End.\"  Depp is back as bank robber John Dillinger, revered in the Depression as a modern-day Robin Hood.  Now, Hollywood shape-shifter Johnny Depp is back as another unexpectedly charismatic outlaw: Depression-era bank robber John Dillinger, a character he says he's been drawn to since he was a boy.  \"I sort of had a fascination with John Dillinger when I was about 10, 11 years old, for some reason,\" Depp told CNN. \"I always kind of admired him, oddly.\"  Oddly, perhaps, because for a short but intense period between September 1933 and July 1934 Dillinger and his gang rampaged through the American Midwest, staging jail breaks, robbing banks, and killing 10 men and wounding seven along the way.  Dillinger's violent spree is the focus of gangster drama \"Public Enemies,\" the latest offering from director Michael Mann, and also starring Christian Bale and Marion Cotillard.  Mann is known for his sympathetic portrayal of criminals, and Dillinger -- whose acts on the wrong side of the law led him to become one of America's first celebrities -- is the quintessential good hood.  In the 1930s, the United States was in the grips of the worst financial disaster in history -- a time when many Americans watched their life savings disappear and became jobless and hungry.  Members of the public blamed banks for losing their money and politicians for failing to stop them. For many, Dillinger's exploits represented sticking it to the fat cats, and he was idolized as a modern-day Robin Hood.  J. Edgar Hoover, FBI director at the time, may have made Dillinger America's first Public Enemy No. 1, but the bandit was careful not to alienate the public.  There is a memorable moment where he drapes a coat over a female bank hostage during a raid to keep her warm. Also, it's said he never swore in front of women.  He was always courteous even as he tried to meet his target of robbing banks in under two minutes. Crucially, he never robbed the average guy, telling him to put his money away during robberies.  It is this Dillinger that Depp captures: a captivating revolutionary with the gift of  gab who lit the public's imagination, causing people to flock to cinemas to watch his exploits in weekly newsreels. Review: Depp is great in 'Public Enemies'  Of course, the dark, violent side of  Dillinger's psyche is unavoidable. Depp plumbed the depths of his own character to come up with those murkier elements.  That was something that took courage, according to Mann: \"He had Dillinger in him; that's something I sensed. Deep in the core of Johnny there's a toughness.\"  Depp gained recognition throughout the 1990s for immersing himself in characters. He shook off an early reputation as a teen pin-up in movies like Tim Burton's 1991 Gothic tale \"Edward Scissorhands.\"  He went on to cement his reputation for unusual film choices and quirky performances in films like \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" (2005) and \"Finding Neverland\" (2004).  In pictures: Johnny Depp's iconic roles \u00bb  The 46-year-old actor says he felt a close affinity to Dillinger: \"I related to John Dillinger like he was a relative. I felt he was of the same blood. He reminded me of my stepdad and very much of my grandfather.  \"He seemed to be one of those guys with absolutely no bull whatsoever, who lived at a time when a man was a man.\"  \"Public Enemies\" was adapted by Mann from a nonfiction book of the same name by Bryan Burrough. Is it sozzled Captain. Jack Sparrow or smooth Donnie Brasco? Tell us your favorite Johnny Depp character in the SoundOff box below.  The \"Last of the Mohicans\" director is known for fastidious research and attention to detail, which in this case included collaborating closely with the FBI to check facts -- although Mann subsequently chose to gloss over some elements for the sake of the story.  Mann filmed in many of the locations where Dillinger's story took place almost 80 years ago, including the Biograph Theater on Lincoln Avenue in Chicago, where the bandit was finally shot dead by FBI agents as he came out of a Clark Gable movie.  They also shot at Little Bohemia Lodge in Manitowish Waters in the far north of Wisconsin, the site of one of Dillinger's most famous showdowns with the FBI.  Dillinger was hiding out there after a botched robbery. When the feds finally caught up with him, two men were killed in the vicious gunfight.  \"We were able to shoot not just in the actual place where this happened, but in his actual room,\" says Mann.  \"There's a certain kind of magic for Johnny Depp to be lying in the bed that John Dillinger was actually in.\"  A lot of Dillinger's success was down to superior guns and getaway cars. Depp, who has experience shooting guns from previous productions, had to learn a completely different technique for the heavy guns of the time.  Depp says shooting the Thompson submachine gun was one of the highlights of the production: \"When you've got a beast like that strapped to you and you're emptying magazines, a 50-round drum, it's a good feeling.\"  The ride may have been thrilling for Depp but he also recognizes that the Depression-era setting has some extra significance these tight-belted times.  \"You know,\" says Depp, \"We're in the middle of a recession, teetering on a depression.

{"article": "Editor's note: Zeyno Baran, a native of Turkey, is senior fellow for the Center for Islam, Democracy and the Future of the Muslim World at the Hudson Institute, a Washington-based think tank that says it is dedicated to \"global security, prosperity and freedom.\" From January 2003 until 2006, Baran directed the International Security and Energy Programs at The Nixon Center.  Zeyno Baran says the United States can learn much from Turkey's expertise on Afghanistan and Pakistan.  (CNN) -- Turks greeted President Obama with huge excitement Monday. This was the first time a U.S. president visited Turkey at the start of his term, sending a clear signal that this administration recognizes the importance of Turkey and wants to engage with it from the start.  His address in the Turkish parliament was one of the greatest speeches made by an American leader in such a setting: He not only showed his deep understanding of Turkey's many complex issues and identities, but also handled tough issues with great skill. He framed his talk just right by underlining Turkey's European identity as a secular democracy.  That said, it is important to remember how good U.S.-Turkey relations were at the start of the Bush administration. President George W. Bush also considered Turkey an extremely valuable partner, but then came the Iraq war. The United States genuinely believed Turkey would be one of the most important allies going forward.  Despite official channels and experts making clear the difficulties in allowing U.S. military to cross into Iraq via its lands, the administration chose to listen to those who sang music to its ears. As a result, they based a whole military strategy on the Turkish parliament voting yes and were shocked when they received a no. Bilateral relations then entered a downward spiral.  With Obama's election, there is renewed excitement in Turkey. Like most of the people of Turkey, he opposed the Iraq war and considered Afghanistan the \"good war.\" Going forward, as President Obama underscored in his speech, Turkey can play an important role in Afghanistan as a reliable NATO ally. The question is: How can Turkey best help?  Turkey is one of the few -- possibly the only -- NATO member that has deep religious, cultural and historic knowledge of both Afghanistan and Pakistan. In fact, the Turkish government has brought together the presidents of Afghanistan and Pakistan much before the United States began approaching them together.  Reading the tea leaves, one may conclude that the Obama administration wants to cooperate with Turkey in engaging with the Taliban in Pakistan and Afghanistan. This would be the wrong kind of cooperation. Although Turkey has channels to the Taliban and has means to facilitate the talks, there cannot be a morally acceptable deal reached with the Taliban, whose ultimate goal is to curb all individual freedoms and universal human rights, especially when it comes to women.  No matter what the reasonable sounding arguments may be in favor of this strategy, pulling Turkey into any kind of engagement with the Taliban -- either as part of NATO or bilaterally -- would have much worse long-term consequences.  Instead, the Obama administration needs to think of \"victory\" not only in the short term and from a purely anti-terrorism perspective, but also in consideration of the people who have lived and will continue to live in those lands. In other words, providing true safety, security, justice and development for Afghanistan and Pakistan -- not the kind of society the Taliban has been providing.  Indeed, it is in providing the basic securities that Turkey can be a great partner. Turkey not only can and will continue to help provide safety and physical security, but also could further assist with the reconstruction projects, such as building hospitals, schools, sanitation facilities and investment projects that would have direct impact on the socioeconomic development of the Afghan and Pakistani societies.  There are many Turkish companies that have undertaken successful construction projects in these fields since early 2002. There are also military and civilian trainers, nongovernment organizations and even volunteer teachers who work in some of the most dangerous regions.  Still, Turkey can possibly make the greatest contribution by helping the United States frame the challenges it is facing in a more accurate and honest way. Just as President Obama referred to his personal story and that of the United States to help Turks look deeper within, Turks can do the same for the United States.  To start, Turkey can explain how the vast Eurasian region it belongs to is not just part of the \"Muslim world\" but has been at the crossroads of eastern and western cultures and ideas and witnessed many brutal wars and massacres over the millennia. Moreover, each country has its own spirit -- there are ancient cultures and tribal formations, and these do not move fast. It is important to stop and drink the tea.  Turkey can also explain that it is only in recent decades that jihadism and extremism took root in these lands known for their Sufi teachings that talk about love, instead of hatred. As a true partner, it can also help the United States recognize its share, along with many others, in inadvertently contributing to the creation of the Taliban and al-Qaeda by making bad foreign policy choices.  Anything short of recognition of the past catching up with us will leave us all unprepared for what may come in the future. In other words, we may be doomed to repeat the same mistakes until we learn our lesson.

{"article": " -- We all know what happens when urban sprawl gets out of control: Commutes back up, smog thickens, and concrete suburbs gobble up green spaces.  The oceans are growing crowded, and governments are increasingly trying to plan their use.  But what about \"ocean sprawl\"?  Until recently, no one gave that idea much thought. But the oceans, like the land, have gotten crowded, and now scientists and policy makers are looking for ways to plan ocean development -- with the aim of preventing our public-owned seas from turning into sprawling, watery versions of Houston, Texas, or Atlanta, Georgia.  \"The oceans are kind of the last frontier for use and development,\" said Amanda Leland, ocean policy director at the Environmental Defense Fund, an advocacy group. \"Even in the 1970s we thought that the oceans were limitless resources of fish. We know today now that fisheries are collapsing all around the world.\"  In an attempt to address this and other crowding problems, governments are for the first time devising comprehensive plans for their marine waters.  The Obama administration on June 12 announced a task force devoted to federal ocean planning. By September, the group must recommend a national policy on the subject that's designed to protect ocean ecology, address climate change and promote sustainable ocean economies.  A handful of states, including Massachusetts and Rhode Island, are charting similar courses. Massachusetts on June 30 published a draft plan for its coastal waters, which is scheduled to be finalized by the end of the year. One of the state's main aims is to make space for two ocean wind farms -- taking up 2 percent of the state's waters -- without angering fishing industries, killing whales or harming ecosystems.  Internationally, several European countries, including Denmark, Belgium, the United Kingdom and France, are pioneering the new field, said Fanny Douvere, a co-principal investigator at UNESCO's Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission.  Ocean advocates say these planning processes are urgently needed and have been a long time in coming.  One reason it's taken so long is that people can't see that the oceans are filling up, said Sandra Whitehouse, a marine biologist and senior adviser at the Ocean Conservancy, an environmental group.  \"The majority of the ecosystem is under the water,\" Whitehouse said. \"So it's out of sight, out of mind. We're only looking at the surface.\"  Beneath the water, though, overfishing has caused some fish stocks to collapse. By one report, wild fish could disappear by mid-century.  The energy sector threatens to take up large chunks of water. Shipping lanes cross the paths of endangered whales. Fish farms are growing in some countries. Climate change is altering ocean chemistry. And power lines, reefs, lobster traps and sunken ships compete for seafloor space.  In Europe's North Sea, expanding industries have tried to claim three times the amount of ocean space than is available, said Douvere, of UNESCO.  What happens on land also affects the oceans. A 2003 report by the Pew Oceans Commission says that each year, coastal development destroys 20,000 acres of estuaries and near-coast fish habitat.  Furthermore, pavement on land creates \"expressways\" for oil and other pollutants to run into the ocean. \"Every eight months, nearly 11 million gallons of oil run off our streets and driveways into our waters -- the equivalent of the Exxon Valdez oil spill,\" the report says.  When the renewable energy sector started trying to move into the sea, the situation went from crowded to unmanageable and without a clear plan, said Whitehouse, of the Ocean Conservancy.  \"There's a lot of pressure to be able to harness this energy,\" she said, \"but it's very important that this be done in a proactive and comprehensive way, because we also have so many important economic aspects of our oceans.\"  Since there are new uses but not new space, planning is necessary, said Charles Ehler, another co-principal investigator at the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission. He added, \"There's not enough space for everything, and there are going to have to be trade-offs that are made.\"  Current efforts focus on broad public interest rather than specific conflicts, Ehler said.  Until now, the ocean primarily was divvied up in a sort of \"free-for-all\" in which \"whoever gets there first gets the access,\" he said.  Leland, of the Environmental Defense Fund, said the patchwork of federal agencies managing the oceans in the United States contributes to the problem.  More than 140 federal laws govern the ocean's use; and six federal departments, along with dozens of agencies, are in charge of implementing those laws, according to the Pew Oceans Commission report.  Charles M. Wahle, a marine ecologist and senior scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said Obama's ocean-planning efforts are a complete shift in thinking.  \"We're acknowledging that we want and need to use the ocean in a lot of different ways,\" he said. \"They all have standing, and we need to figure out a way to allocate them fairly and sustainably.\"  He added, \"Fifty years from now, you should be able to go to a place [in the ocean] and know what will be happening there.\"  There are skeptics of the shift.  Commercial fisheries are hampered by current regulations and could be further harmed if the ocean is divided up among too many groups, said Jim Ruhle, president of Commercial Fishermen of America, an industry group.  \"We make our livelihoods from that ocean, and we want to make sure that we have reasonable plans in effect to allow that to take place,\" he said.  Some other fishing groups oppose new ocean uses, like offshore wind energy, entirely.  Despite this new emphasis on planning, there's still a chance that ocean waters could go the way of haphazard cities.  \"The proof will be in the pudding,\" said Wahle, of NOAA.  But he said it's exciting that so many groups are on board for a new way of thinking.  \"If we do our jobs right, overall, the oceans will be healthier, ecosystems will be more productive, people will derive more services and benefits and value from those ecosystems,\" he said, \"and industry will be able to plan and commit and invest in ways that actually work.\"", "Q": ["Q: What does the advocate say?

{"article": "LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- Los Angeles Angels pitcher Nick Adenhart was among three people killed in a crash in Fullerton, California, early Thursday, according to the team and a hospital spokesman.  Los Angeles Angels pitcher Nick Adenhart was killed Thursday, hours after his fourth MLB start.  Adenhart, 22, of Silver Spring, Maryland, died at UC Irvine Medical Center, according to spokesman John Murray.  \"The Angels family has suffered a tremendous loss today,\" Tony Reagins, the team's general manager, said in a written statement. \"We are deeply saddened and shocked by this tragic loss. Our thoughts and prayers go out to Nick's family, friends, loved ones and fans.\"  One person was arrested in connection with the three-vehicle accident, which occurred about 12:23 a.m. Thursday in Fullerton, south of Los Angeles. Witnesses say a red minivan ran a red light and struck two vehicles at an intersection, police Lt. Craig Brower said.  One of the vehicles, a gray Mitsubishi, slammed into a power pole, Brower said. Two of its passengers were declared dead at the scene, he said. The other two were transported to UC Irvine Medical Center.  Murray said Adenhart underwent surgery and died at the hospital but did not know whether he died during or after the procedure. Brower said the remaining passenger was in critical condition.  The Angels said the two dead at the scene were the female driver of the Mitsubishi and another male. No other members of the Angels organization were involved, the team said.  Adenhart reportedly was \"in bad condition at the scene,\" team spokesman Tim Mead said, and there wasn't much that could be done for him at the hospital. He died \"mid- to late morning,\" Mead said.  A passenger in the minivan was taken to a hospital with minor injuries, Brower said. The third vehicle sustained minor damage, and its driver was unhurt, he said. Police did not identify any of the dead.  The minivan's driver fled the scene and was later arrested, Brower said. Andrew Thomas Gallo, 22, of Riverside will face charges of manslaughter, felony driving under the influence and hit-and-run, he said.  Footage from the scene showed the minivan with a smashed front end and the Mitsubishi, which was heavily damaged. Debris littered the intersection where the crash took place, and it was cordoned off with yellow police tape.  The Angels' game Thursday night with the Oakland A's was postponed at the direction of Major League Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig. No information was released as to when the game would be played.  \"Major League Baseball is in mourning today upon the news of this tragedy that has taken Angels pitcher Nick Adenhart and two others,\" Selig said in a statement. \"Nick was just 22 years of age, with a wonderful life and career ahead of him. On behalf of Major League Baseball, I extend my sincere sympathy to the families and friends of all three victims and to the entire Angels' organization. I send my deepest condolences to Nick's parents, Jim and Janet. The hearts of everyone in baseball are with them at this most difficult time.\"  The Angels quoted Adenhart's family in the team statement, saying they express \"sincere gratitude for all the help the Angels have provided.\"  \"He lived his dream and was blessed to be part of an organization comprised of such warm, caring and compassionate people,\" Adenhart's parents said. \"The Angels were his extended family. Thanks to all of Nick's loyal supporters and fans throughout his career. He will always be in everyone's hearts forever.\"  Funeral and memorial arrangements were pending, the team said.  Adenhart pitched in a game against the Oakland A's on Wednesday night in Anaheim, California, making a \"brilliant effort\" despite the Angels' 6-4 loss, according to MLB.com.  In his fourth major league start, Adenhart pitched a scoreless six innings, with seven hits, three walks and five strikeouts.  \"I thought he pitched a terrific game,\" manager Mike Scioscia told MLB.com after the game. \"He gave us a chance to win. He has better tools out there now. He pitched ahead a lot and was able to get back in counts and put guys away.\"  \"It felt good to work out of some jams early,\" Adenhart told MLB.com. \"My curveball was really working for me, and then my change came on later when I felt I needed it.\"  Jim Adenhart had flown out from Baltimore, Maryland, and was at Wednesday night's game to watch his son's start, his first of the season, Mead said. He remained in California on Thursday, and Janet Adenhart was expected to fly out later in the day.  The Angels drafted Adenhart in the 14th round of the June 2004 draft, according to the team statement. He was in his fifth professional season and made the Angels' Opening Day roster for the first time.  \"Adenhart earned his spot in the Angels rotation via a spring training in which he recorded a 3-0 record and a 3.12 ERA over the course of six starts,\" the team statement said. \"During that span, he struck out 18 while allowing only five base on balls.\"  Adenhart made his major league debut May 1 against Oakland, the team said. At the time, he was the youngest active-roster pitcher in the majors.  Adenhart was a 2004 graduate of Williamsport High School in Williamsport, Maryland. His baseball coach there, Rod Steiner, told CNN affiliate WHAG, \"After watching last night, as well as he pitched... things seemed to be going so smooth. This is the last thing that you ever imagine.\"  He remembered Adenhart as a hard worker who knew he wanted to be a major-league pitcher while still in high school and worked hard to achieve that goal, despite a setback when he had to undergo shoulder surgery.  He said area residents who didn't even know Adenhart followed his career and cheered him on. \"He touched a lot of lives.\"  CNN's Rosalina Nieves and Irving Last contributed to this report.", "Q": ["Q: What do police say about it?

{"article": " -- Swiss police were scrambling Monday in search of three masked men who stole four Impressionist paintings worth about $163 million (180 million Swiss francs) Sunday in a heist police characterized as \"spectacular.\"  Claude Monet's \"Poppies near Vetheuil\" was one of the famous paintings stolen by the armed robbers.  The three men entered the E.G. Buehrle Collection -- among the finest collections of Impressionist and post-Impressionist art in the world -- in Zurich, Switzerland, at around 4:30 p.m. CET (8:30 a.m. ET), police said.  One of the men threatened personnel at the museum's front door with a pistol and forced them to the ground, police said, while the other two men went into an exhibition room and stole four oil paintings by Paul Cezanne, Edgar Degas, Claude Monet and Vincent van Gogh.  Afterward, the three men loaded the paintings -- Monet's \"Poppies near Vetheuil,\" Degas' \"Count Lepic and his Daughters,\" Van Gogh's \"Blossoming Chestnut Branches\" and Cezanne's \"Boy in a Red Vest\" -- into a white car parked in front of the museum and then drove off, police said.  Police said the men were wearing dark clothes and hoods, and one of them spoke German with a Slavic accent. They were all of average height, police said.  There is a reward of $91,000 (100,00 Swiss francs) for information leading to the return of the paintings, police said.  The Swiss art heist follows the recent theft in Switzerland of two paintings by Pablo Picasso, Bjoern Quellenberg, a spokesman for the Kunsthaus, a major art museum in Zurich, said.  The 'dumbest' form of art crime \u00bb  The director of the Kunsthaus serves on the E.G. Buhrle private art foundation's council, Quellenberg said.  In that theft, thieves stole the paintings, the 1962 \"Tete de Cheval\" (\"Horse's Head\") and the 1944 \"Verre et Pichet\" (\"Glass and Pitcher\") by Picasso. They were on loan from a German museum and valued at $4.5 million when they were stolen February 6, according to news reports.

{"article": " -- Forget almost everything you ever thought you knew about the moon.  NASA's latest missions indicate the moon is much more than a dead, unchanging satellite orbiting Earth. It's a dynamic environment, with changes occurring by the day and week, not over millions of years.  The space agency says the missions are rewriting lunar science text books and revolutionizing what scientists know about Earth's closest neighbor.  An announcement in November probably rivaled Neil Armstrong's first steps on the surface more than 40 years earlier: There's water on the moon.  The Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite, or L-CROSS, and its companion spacecraft crashed into a crater at the moon's south pole in October and discovered water in a very dark and very cold place. L-CROSS researchers said about 25 gallons of water were detected in the crater, which measured about 60 feet wide by a few feet deep.  Michael Wargo, NASA'S chief lunar scientist on the L-CROSS mission, said the probes detected more than water in the crater, but researchers are still trying to understand what the other stuff is.  \"We're opening new chapters. And in fact, because some of this information is so new and it's so different from the way we use to think about the moon, there are chapters that are blank right now,\" he said. You know that they're going to written, but we don't even know the questions yet that are going to be engendered from this new information.\"  Wargo describes the lunar data as a treasure trove. The moon \"is like the dusty attic of the solar system, in that things get collected there and they give you insight, not just into the moon, but the evolution of the solar system.\"  Earthbound explorations, such as Lewis and Clark's historic journey to the Pacific Ocean in the early 19th century, carry critically necessary items, but they have no need to haul wood or water. That's not so for manned space flight. Those missions will have to carry all the supplies necessary for survival unless they can manufacture some of them either in flight or on a planet's surface.  The presence of water and other compounds on the moon means there are potential resources that could sustain future exploration of the moon and beyond.  NASA is also mapping the moon's surface in unprecedented detail, eventually creating the first moon atlas. The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, which launched last summer, is the robotic scout that is providing the data. LRO is on a mission that could last several years -- orbiting the moon and gathering crucial data that will help astronauts prepare for another visit.  Wargo said LRO is carrying high-resolution cameras, which have now mapped about 50 areas on the moon, including the Apollo mission landing sites.  \"We have cameras on board that have been able to image where the Apollo spacecraft landed, and you can literally see where they put down their scientific packages, where the astronauts walked on the moon,\" according to Wargo.  The LRO discovered it's extremely cold in the permanently shadowed polar craters, where temperatures dip more than 400 degrees below zero Fahrenheit, or 249 degrees below zero Celsius. That's not far from absolute zero, defined by international agreement as 273.15 degrees below zero Celsius and a temperature that cannot be physically reached. These are the coldest temperatures ever recorded in the solar system.  The LRO is also measuring space radiation on the moon. Astronauts will need protection from this radiation during expeditions to the moon and other destinations.  All this information is critical if humans are to make it back to the moon by 2020, the the target date set by the Bush administration in 2004. But it's more than that. Wargo sum it up this way:  \"We used to think of the moon as this really dead and unchanging place, that the moon was a dead planet.... There are changes that occur there not over the course of thousands or millions or even billions of years, but are changing over the course of days and weeks and months. That's something people just hadn't thought of until just weeks and months ago.... This isn't your grandfather's moon anymore.\"", "Q": ["Q: What could the discovery of water boost?

{"article": "  -- The U.S. Coast Guard Sunday continues its search for a missing sailor whose five Texas A&M University crew mates were hoisted out of the Gulf of Mexico earlier in the day after their sailboat capsized.  Members of the Texas A&M Offshore Sailing Team are shown in this photo from the team's Web site.  The survivors -- four university students and a safety officer -- told the Coast Guard they were forced off their sailboat after it took on water and capsized.  \"The flooding was so fast that the thing flipped over,\" USGS Capt. William Diehl told CNN.  The missing sailor has been identified by the university as Roger Stone, the vessel's second safety officer.  The sailboat, named Cynthia Woods, was one of about two dozen boats heading from Galveston, Texas, to Veracruz, Mexico, for the annual Veracruz Regatta race, which began on Friday.  Diehl said the boat was well-stocked with safety equipment -- including emergency radio beacons, life rafts and ring buoys -- but the crew could only manage to find four life jackets after the boat tipped over.  \"The survivors told us that [when] they went into the water, they had four life jackets among the five, and they huddled together and they exchanged the life jacket among them so that they could stay afloat,\" Diehl said.  Communication with the boat was lost about midnight Friday, and the boat missed its 8 a.m. radio check the next morning, the Coast Guard reported.  A sailboat matching the description of the missing 38-foot boat was found overturned about 5:15 p.m. Saturday, authorities said.  The five survivors were found several hours later, lifted to safety by a U.S. Coast Guard helicopter around 1 a.m. and taken to University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston for treatment.  A Coast Guard spokeswoman could not say exactly where the survivors were rescued, but said the search was focused on an area about 10 miles south of Matagorda, Texas.  Diehl said a Marine Corps C-130, a Coast Guard cutter and a man-of-war naval vessel are searching for the missing crew member. All the mariners were experienced sailors, he said.  \"They were very well trained,\" Diehl said. \"Obviously [they were] the more senior cadets at the university here, and they had very experienced safety people on board.\"  When rescuers retrieved the capsized boat's hull, Diehl said the keel was missing.  \"That's the part that keeps the sailboat balanced in the water,\" he said. \"And from talking to the survivors this morning, that's where the flooding started for them.\"  The 725-mile Veracruz regatta began on Friday and boats are expected to arrive in Veracruz on Wednesday and Thursday.", "Q": ["Q: What was found capsized?

{"article": " -- \"China is not on the Internet, it's basically an intranet. Everything is banned by the Great Firewall,\" says Sherman So, co-author of \"Red Wired: China's Internet Revolution.\"  Sherman So, author of \"Red Wired,\" talks about China's online habits and Internet culture.  With 338 million Internet users in June 2009, according to the China Internet Network Information Center (CNNIC), China is no longer a niche market of the online industry.  Chinese is the second most common language on the Internet, according to The Economist, and quickly gaining ground on English.  As the former technology writer for Hong Kong's daily English-language newspaper, South China Morning Post, So has been following closely China's exponential Internet developments over the past decade.  What inspired her to write \"Red Wired\" was the chasm in online culture on either side of China's carefully controlled borders.  \"The information gap between those who are from this part of the world and who know Chinese and those who are from another part of world and who don't is just so huge,\" observes So.  \"I've talked to lots of investors, analysts, visitors to Hong Kong, and they really don't know what's happening in China. They ask the silliest questions about China and the Internet.\"  \"Red Wired\" tells the stories behind China's homegrown online start-ups, often overtaking dominant start-ups that have been successful in the West but which flailed after venturing into Chinese territory.  One anecdote involves an advertisement by Baidu, China's most popular search engine, teasing Google China for not knowing Chinese.  Google focused on high-end technology rather than Chinese linguistics. From 2002 to 2005, Google's Chinese site also suffered interference from the Chinese government, which redirected users to Baidu whenever Google's search results failed to comply with China's censorship rules.  Although Google China has since learned the lingo and learned to cooperate with the higher order, it still trails Baidu with only 28 percent of the search-engine market share, compared to Baidu's 63 percent, according to a 2008 study by Analysys International.  Conquering the Internet with Chinese characteristics  So what are the unique characteristics of China's Netizens?  While 25.5 percent of the Chinese population is now online, CNNIC's 2008 statistics sketch a relatively coherent portrait of the mainstream majority of them: 67 percent are below the age of 30; 73 percent have only a high school education or lower; 33 percent are students; and 28 percent fall into the lowest income bracket of under $75 per month.  Moreover, 78 percent go online at home and 42 percent log on at an Internet cafe. Once connected, 84 percent listen to music, 75 percent instant-message, 63 percent play online games, and only 57 percent e-mail.  In short, for the vast majority of Chinese, Internet means play, not work.  One could conclude that an Internet entrepreneur's target audience in China is teenage and twenty-something students, low-end consumers in search of entertainment with plenty of time to kill.  Among the most salient of China's Internet start-ups are those that innovated on proven Western models by successfully adapting them to the Chinese market.  Tencent, with a 77 percent market share of instant messaging services nationwide, is one of the start-ups that gets it. Tencent is now the largest Internet company in China.  \"What really made [Tencent founder] Pony Ma stand out is that he viewed his QQ instant messenger differently from other IM services such as MSN and Yahoo,\" says So.  \"They viewed IM as a two-way communication, so made it as efficient as possible. They targeted the high-end white-collar users, thinking they're rich, advertisers will love them, they'll buy additional services.  \"Ma thought differently. QQ was a community targeting low-end users -- kids, factory workers. They don't need efficiency, they come online to kill time, to be entertained, to talk with friends, not to do work.\"  In a China where economic growth comes at different speeds, So believes that the Internet has leveled out the playing field.  \"The online population in China comes from very modest families,\" she says.  \"Forty percent go online at Internet cafes, which is the cheapest entertainment alternative you can find. It costs just 30 cents per hour.

{"article": "Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Afghan electoral officials Monday declared incumbent President Hamid Karzai the winner of another term in office, after canceling this weekend's second round of voting.  U.S. President Barack Obama called Monday for a \"new chapter\" of improved governance in Afghanistan now that Karzai's re-election as president is complete.  Observers say Karzai's real test will be whether he can form a government that is seen as legitimate in the eyes of the Afghan people and the international community.  Afghanistan's Independent Electoral Commission announced Karzai's victory Monday after it canceled Saturday's presidential runoff because of the withdrawal of candidate Abdullah Abdullah.  A runoff could have been held with just one candidate, but commission president Azizullah Lodin said electoral officials decided to cancel the second round of voting for several reasons, including security and money. The decision was made just a couple of hours before the announcement, according to commission deputy Zakria Barakzai.  Afghans went to the polls on August 20, in a vote marred by widespread fraud. Karzai had initially claimed victory, but two months after the vote, a U.N.-backed panel of election monitors threw out nearly a third of his votes, citing fraud. That left Karzai short of a majority, and he eventually agreed to the runoff.  Abdullah had called for the resignations of top election officials and politicians to avert electoral fraud in the runoff. He argued that the commissioners, who are hired by Karzai, cannot be impartial.  But that request was not met, Abdullah said Sunday, and he did not believe a transparent election was possible.  \"I want this to be an example for the future so that no one again tries to use fraud to abuse the rights of the Afghan people,\" Abdullah told reporters.  U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon arrived in Kabul on Monday hours before the commission's announcement. He issued a statement welcoming the decision, congratulating Karzai, and restating the U.N.'s commitment to supporting the new government.  \"This has been a difficult election process for Afghanistan and lessons must be learned,\" Ban said in the statement. \"Afghanistan now faces significant challenges and the new president must move swiftly to form a government that is able to command the support of both the Afghan people and the international community.\"  On Monday, Ban met with both Karzai and Abdullah, as well as U.N. officials, including Kai Eide, head of the U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan.  The U.S. Embassy in Kabul also issued a statement Monday welcoming the commission's decision and congratulating Karzai.  In Washington, President Barack Obama told reporters in the White House that he had congratulated Karzai in a telephone conversation.  \"Although the process was messy, I'm pleased to say that the final outcome was determined in accordance with Afghan law,\" Obama said.  He said he told Karzai \"that this has to be a point in time in which we begin to write a new chapter based on improved governance, a much more serious effort to eradicate corruption, joint efforts to accelerate the training of Afghan security forces so that the Afghan people can provide for their own security.\"  Obama added that Karzai assured him he understands the importance of the moment, \"but as I indicated to him, the proof is not going to be in words, it's going to be in deeds.\"  Despite the resolved election issue, Gibbs refused to put a firm timetable on when Obama would announce whether he would increase troop levels Afghanistan. Instead, Gibbs repeated past language that the decision would be made within weeks.  \"Now begin the hard conversations about ensuring credibility and ensuring improving governance, addressing corruption\" in Afghanistan, Gibbs said.  Sen. John McCain, the Arizona Republican defeated by Obama in last year's presidential race, said Monday that Karzai's re-election should encourage Obama to fulfill Gen. Stanley McChrystal's request for up to 40,000 more troops.  \"The most urgent priority now is to support our Afghan partners in reversing what General McChrystal has rightly called the 'deteriorating' security situation,\" McCain said in a statement. \"This requires a properly-resourced counterinsurgency strategy, and I urge President Obama to provide our civilian and military leaders with the resources they need to succeed.\"  The cancellation of the runoff \"puts the election issue behind us,\" but Karzai has yet to achieve a true victory, according to the former U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad.  \"Now the key issue is how the Afghan people will react to this, what kind of government will President Karzai put together, and how the international community will react,\" Khalilzad said on CNN's \"American Morning.\" \"We're in a new stage now in Afghanistan.\"  Khalilzad had predicted last week that Abdullah would quit the race, in an interview for CNN's \"Amanpour.\"  \"First, he doesn't have much money left,\" he said in the interview, which aired Sunday. \"Second, I think that he thinks that given the situation, he's likely to lose, and maybe he'll get less votes than he did in the first round, so that would be embarrassing.\"  Speaking to CNN following his withdrawal, Abdullah said his decision does not mean he has given up public life.  \"I will be available to serve this country,\" he said. \"At this stage, I am in consultation with my followers, with my supporters and a movement for change will be there and I will lead that movement. There is no doubt about it.\"  Karzai served as acting president following the U.S. ouster of Taliban rulers in 2001, then secured a victory in the 2004 elections. He begins his second term in office amid a resurgence of the Taliban.  The militants claimed responsibility for a Wednesday attack that killed five United Nations workers -- two of whom were helping with the vote. Nine others were wounded in the attack, on a guest house in Kabul. In response, the United Nations ordered nonessential personnel out of the country.  International troop levels increased this year to provide security for the Afghan election in August.  Attacks against U.S. and NATO forces have also spiked: 59 American troops died in Afghanistan in October, the highest U.S. monthly toll since the war began eight years ago.

{"article": "  -- The former Utah state trooper suspected in a series of roadway shootings earlier this week died Wednesday, the Dallas County Medical Examiner's Office said.  CNN affiliate KSL in Salt Lake City, Utah, provided this file photo of the Dallas suspect, Brian Smith.  Police said Tuesday that Brian Smith attempted suicide after Monday's shootings. Smith was brought to a local hospital in serious condition, officials said  At 7 p.m. Wednesday Smith died at Parkland Hospital, the medical examiner's office said. An autopsy is slated for Thursday.  Two people were killed in the shootings along a three-mile stretch on and near the LBJ Freeway, about 10 miles northeast of downtown Dallas.  Police used ballistic tests to link Smith, a 12-year veteran of the Utah state police, to three of the four shootings, Dallas Police Lt. Craig Miller said Tuesday.  Miller said Smith was a suspect in both nonfatal shootings and one of the fatal shootings. He said it was unclear if Smith was a suspect in the fatal shooting that occurred first.  The first attack occurred in the city of Garland at about 5:41 p.m. Victim Jorge Lopez, 20, was sitting in his Nissan at a traffic light in Garland when a man in a pickup pulled alongside him and fired shots into his car, killing him, Officer Joe Harn of the Garland police said.  A few minutes later and two miles away on the LBJ Freeway, a gunman fired at two tractor-trailers.  While one driver escaped injuries, William Scott Miller, 42, of Frankfort, Kentucky, was shot to death behind the wheel of a United Van Lines truck, police said.  \"He was going to be traveling home,\" Lt. Miller said. \"He was about to park his rig. He was going to get on a plane to fly to be with his wife and children for the Christmas season and then come back to this location.\"  Miller called the truck driver a hero because he was able to control his rig before he died -- preventing other motorists from being hurt.  The fourth attack came a mile west on LBJ Freeway, where gunfire shattered the windshield of another tractor-trailer. The bullets missed the driver, but flying glass caused minor cuts, police said.  Smith, 37, left his trooper job in Utah after he was caught abusing alcohol and drugs, CNN affiliate WFAA reported, citing an official report. The sergeant began using drugs and alcohol after his patrol car was rear-ended while he was writing a ticket, according to the report by Utah Peace Officers Standards and Training.  He moved to Texas shortly afterward, the station said.  Harn told WFAA that Smith's wife had phoned police Monday to say her husband was suicidal and driving around with a gun. Police were able to locate him using cell phone transmission towers. A three-hour stand-off followed, ending when Smith shot himself in the head, Harn said.", "Q": ["Q: another wounded in Dallas rush hour Monday A:", "Q: Who were shot and killed?

{"article": "  -- South Africa inflicted the first home series defeat on Australia in almost 16 years as they wrapped up a nine-wicket win over the world's number one ranked Test nation in Melbourne on Tuesday.  South African captain Graeme Smith led from the front with 75 as his team wrapped up victory.  Captain Graeme Smith hit a fluent 75 as his side successfully passed a modest victory target of 183 on the final day at the MCG to take an unassailable 2-0 lead.  It was the South African's first-ever Test series triumph in Australia and victory in the third and final match in Sydney will see them leapfrog the home side at the top of the global rankings.  Hashim Amla (30 not out) scored the winning runs shortly after lunch as South Africa became the first team to overcome Australia at home since the West Indies in 1992-93.  South Africa were never under any pressure in their run chase and did not lose a wicket until just before lunch when the inspirational Smith was trapped leg before wicket by Nathan Hauritz.  Smith had dominated a 121-run opening stand with Neil McKenzie, hitting 10 boundaries.  McKenzie struggled to a half century and survived strong lbw shouts from Brett Lee, who was bowling despite an injured foot that will keep him out of the Sydney Test.  South Africa's victory was set up by a brilliant maiden Test century from JP Duminy, who shared a stunning 180-run ninth wicket partnership with pace bowler Dale Steyn.  It gave the tourists a priceless 65-run lead on first innings before man of the match Steyn worked his magic with the ball as Australia were bowled out on the fourth day for 247 in their second innings.  The pugnacious Smith was virtually lost for words in his victory speech.  \"It has been such a special moment for all of us, it has been an incredible team effort,\" he said.  \"I have been smiling non-stop since we hit the winning runs.  \"To be 2-0 up after this game was something we only dreamt of.\"  South Africa won the first Test in Perth from an unlikely position, chasing 414 for victory for the loss of only four wickets.", "Q": ["Q: How much did South Africa beat Australia by?

{"article": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- Harry Patch -- the last surviving British soldier from World War I -- died Saturday at the age of 111, Britain's Ministry of Defence said.  Harry Patch, pictured here on November 11, 2008, at an Armistice Day commemoration ceremony in London.  Patch died peacefully at his care home in the southwestern English city of Wells, the ministry announced.  His death came a week after fellow British World War I veteran Henry Allingham died at the age of 113.  Patch was the last surviving soldier to have witnessed the horrors of trench warfare in the first World War  He fought and was seriously wounded in Ypres, Belgium, in 1917 at the Battle of Passchendaele, in which 70,000 of his fellow soldiers died -- including three of his close friends.  Born in 1898, Patch became a plumber before being conscripted to the army in 1916. After training, Patch was recruited to The Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry as a Lewis gunner assistant.  The unit was rushed to the front line trenches of Ypres, where soldiers were urgently needed to replace those who were wounded and dying by the thousand.  He fought in the trenches between June and September of 1917 and was involved in some of the fiercest fighting of the war. In late September he was wounded when a light shell exploded above his head, bringing an end to his military service.  He received battlefield treatment without anesthetic.  After the war, Harry returned to his work as a plumber and later became a sanitary engineer. He married Ada Billington, a young girl he met while convalescing after the battle. They married in 1919 and had two sons.  In World War II, Patch joined the Auxiliary Fire Service and helped tackle the fires caused by heavy German raids on the English cities of Bath and Bristol.  At one point, he was sent to organize sanitary arrangements for soldiers at a camp near Yeovil, where he became friendly with some of the men. Patch remembered the shock of finding the camp deserted, with coffee still hot and meals half-eaten, on the morning that the soldiers had gone off to France, the Ministry of Defence said.  His wife, Ada, died in 1976, and their two sons also later died. Patch remarried in 1980, but he became a widower for the second time four years later.  Patch didn't speak about the war until he turned 100, the Ministry of Defence said.  \"He tried to suppress the memories and to live as normal a life as possible; the culture of his time said that he was fortunate to have survived and that he should get on with his life,\" a Ministry of Defence biography says.  \"That suited Harry; he could 'forget' his demons, the memories of what happened to him and to his close friends.\"  In 1998, a television producer with an interest in the war talked to Patch, who then made the decision to speak of his memories, the Ministry of Defence said. He took part in a documentary on the war and began gradually to open up.  It wasn't long before Patch became a spokesman for his generation, speaking about the horrors of the war as well as his own emotions and reactions, the Ministry of Defence said.  \"In speaking about his experiences, Harry began at last to come to terms with his war, and was at peace with himself and his memories,\" the Defence Ministry said. \"His thoughts then turned to reconciliation, to the long-term effects of suffering and coming to terms with that suffering.\"  Patch returned to Belgium in 2002, something he had said he would never do, and laid a wreath to his battalion, the Defence Ministry said.  Two years later, he met and shook hands with a German artilleryman from the Western Front, Charles Kuentz. Patch later laid a wreath at Langemark Cemetery for the German war dead.  In his last years, Patch was honored at Buckingham Palace and the prime minister's residence at 10 Downing Street.  On his 101st birthday France awarded him the Knighthood of the Legion of Honor, and this year President Nicolas Sarkozy upgraded that to the rank of officer.  Last year, King Albert II of Belgium made Patch a Knight of the Order of Leopold.  \"Harry was delighted to receive these awards and wore the medals with great pride, but he always made it clear that he wore these medals as a representative of the selfless generation he had come to represent,\" the Ministry of Defence said.  Patch wrote a book detailing his life in 2007, called \"The Last Fighting Tommy.\" The name referred to the slang term for British privates.  \"While the country may remember Harry as a soldier, we will remember him as a dear friend,\" said Jim Ross, a close friend. \"He was a man of peace who used his great age and fame as the last survivor of the trenches to communicate two simple messages: Remember with gratitude and respect those who served on all sides, (and) settle disputes by discussion, not war.\"  Gen. Richard Dannatt, the chief of the general staff, issued a statement expressing his sadness about Patch's death.  \"Self-effacing about his experiences in the trenches he was no less effective in describing the horror they represented when invited to speak to schoolchildren about the realities of war.\" Dannatt said.  \"He was the last of a generation that in youth was steadfast in its duty in the face of cruel sacrifice and we give thanks for his life -- as well as those of his comrades -- for upholding the same values and freedom that we continue to cherish and fight for today.\"", "Q": ["Q: Where and when was Harry Patch wounded in the World War One?

{"article": " -- Sitting at her home in West Seattle, Washington, Amanda Knox's aunt Janet Huff was watching the live television news coverage that her niece had been convicted of murder.  \"It was terrible, it was gut-wrenching just to hear them say it,\" Huff said of the verdict.  She had been up for more than 11 hours while the jury deliberated, anxiously awaiting word. She remained hopeful but deeply afraid. She couldn't eat.  When the verdict was announced at about midnight in Perugia, Italy, her worst fears came true. Knox and her Italian former boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, were convicted of murdering Knox's roommate Meredith Kercher. Knox was sentenced to 26 years and Sollecito 25 years in prison.  Following the verdict, people flooded out of the Italian courtroom. When the prosecution emerged, a rush of applause followed.  \"To see the people outside the courtroom applauding -- that just made me sick, that people can be that callous and cold,\" Huff said.  Soon after the verdict, Knox's parents, Curt Knox and Edda Mellas, emerged and swiftly moved through the crowd. Watch Janet Huff's interview with CNN's Campbell Brown  Huff said she spoke to Knox's parents shortly after the verdict.  \"They are, of course, shattered. They are not doing great,\" Huff said. \"But we have already started the process of appeals. That's all we can do.\"  For Huff, Knox is still the strong, kindhearted girl she has always known -- not the cold-blooded killer prosecutors portrayed during the trial.  Huff said Knox was worried about the trial's impact on the family.  \"I think that's what gets her through, knowing that she's got to be strong,\" she said. \"If she falls apart, then we are really going to lose it. Knox's parents: Our daughter is no killer  \"I know she is terribly disappointed, heartbroken and scared to death, but she's more concerned about her family and how we are.\"  With Knox's conviction, Huff said the family was moving forward with plans for some relatives to move to Italy to be near Knox. The cost and physical toll of constantly traveling to Italy was weighing on the family, she said.  \"We've looked at jobs and apartments just in case this happened,\" she said. \"There's no way we are going to leave Amanda in Italy all alone.\"  Knox's case has attracted widespread media attention and prompted salacious articles focusing on her sex life. Her name and photo have appeared on the front pages of newspapers all over the world, and now, Huff fears, things may get worse.  \"Now that there's a guilty verdict, she's always going to be remembered as 'The convicted killer Amanda Knox,' and I'm disgusted by that,\" Huff said.  Maria Cantwell, a U.S. senator from Knox's home state of Washington, issued a statement saying she was \"saddened by the verdict.\" \"I have serious questions about the Italian justice system and whether anti-Americanism tainted this trial,\" Cantwell said. \"I will be conveying my concerns to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.\"  Huff said she hopes the appeals process will show what her family has believed all along.  \"She will be vindicated and she will be found innocent,\" she said.  Despite the pain the trial has brought Knox's family, Huff stressed it is nothing compared to what victim Meredith Kercher's family has gone through.  \"They still don't have closure, they may think they are vindicated with the guilty verdict but we know it doesn't bring their daughter back,\" she said.", "Q": ["Q: Who are not doing great?

{"article": " -- Name: Kevin Evans  Weight in January 1994: 315 pounds  Current weight: 215 pounds  Size change: Size 40 to size 32 pants.  History: Evans never took his weight into consideration growing up. He said it wasn't really a problem until he reached college. \"I've always had my baby fat, but as I got to college I started gaining more,\" he said. \"After college, it continued. After graduate school, it continued.\"  Evans said he was unaware of the toll the additional weight was taking on his body. His mom, Helen, said she noticed he would become breathless while completing simple tasks, but she said she was too nervous to speak up. \"I was going to say something to him about it, but I didn't want to hurt his feelings,\" she said.  \"Aha!\" moment: One foot stepped on a scale. Then the other. Evans, a program specialist at Cook Children's Medical Center in Fort Worth, Texas, waited in anticipation as the number beneath him rose higher. And higher. And higher.  It was 315 pounds -- a weight Evans had never dreamed of reaching, but he was forced to accept the indisputable reality that flashed before him. He never wanted to reach 400 pounds. It was time for a change, he said.  Have you lost weight? Tell us about your ''Aha!'' moment on iReport  How he did it: Evans purchased a treadmill to ensure he had access to workout equipment at all times without limiting himself to going to the gym or facing days of bad weather. He started doing cardio for 45 minutes, five days a week. The treadmill came with an eight-week plan for low-calorie meals that he could prepare.  He stayed focused on the program by keeping the price of the treadmill in mind: $1,200. \"I would focus on how much I paid for the treadmill and for that not to be wasted,\" he said. \"I was giving myself one chance to prove myself to myself.\"  Biggest obstacle: Evans said his biggest obstacle was managing his time. When he changed his diet, he included several items that he didn't usually eat, and working them into his daily routine initially was a challenge. He decided to sit down on Sundays and plan his workouts and meals for the week, including when he would prepare food.  Maintaining diet: While dieting, Evan aimed to eat 1,800 calories a day. Now Evans eats five meals a day, with calorie counts totaling 2,500. Some of the items on his regimen include protein shakes, eggs, turkey, almonds, baked chicken breast and steamed veggies.  Maintaining workouts: Evans does 20 minutes of cardio five days a week. He runs intervals for 10 minutes and then does 10 minutes of another aerobic activity such as the StairMaster or a rowing machine.

{"article": "ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Kandi Burruss, the newest cast member of the reality show \"The Real Housewives of Atlanta,\" was mourning the death Saturday of her fianc\u00e9, who died after a fistfight the night before.  Kandi Burruss, at right with co-star NeNe Leakes, appeared at the BET Awards in June.  The fianc\u00e9, 34-year-old Ashley \"A.J.\" Jewell, also appeared on the show.  A spokeswoman for Burruss said the actress was \"devastated\" by the news.  \"She has no statement to make at this time and asks for privacy,\" Tresa Sanders said. She said the two planned to marry, even though the relationship had ups and downs.  In late August, Burruss told WVEE Radio in Atlanta, \"We're on hiatus,\" and she told Essence.com last month that the two were taking a break from each other.  Police said they contacted Burruss after Jewell's death.  Jewell and another man fought Friday night in the parking lot of the Atlanta strip club Body Tap, police spokesman Officer James Polite said. Jewell was taken to a hospital, where he died of blunt force trauma to the head, Polite said.  Fredrick Richardson was arrested on a charge of voluntary manslaughter after witnesses identified him and he was interviewed by police. He was treated at a hospital.  Police tentatively described the men as club managers, although Jewell claimed on Twitter that he owned the establishment. Polite said police don't know why the fight started.  Sanders said Burruss was doubly saddened because she is mourning the death of her uncle, Ralph Leslie, whose funeral is Saturday.  The reality performer posted messages about Jewell's death on Twitter.  \"im just in one of those moods where i dont wanna talk, i dont wanna b held & told its gonna b ok. i just wanna cry myself 2 sleep, alone,\" she says.  \"i could never n a million years imagine this happening. please pray for AJ's children. that's who im the most concerned 4.\"  \"im bout 2 giv my swollen eyes sum rest now. i just wanted to say thanks 2 every1 for their prayers.\"  Burruss is a Grammy-winning singer-songwriter and former member of the 1990s R&B group Xscape.", "Q": ["Q: What were the men?

{"article": "Editor's note: Madeleine K. Albright is former U.S. secretary of state. William S. Cohen is former U.S. secretary of defense. They are co-chairs of the Genocide Prevention Task Force.  Madeleine K. Albright served as secretary of state under President Bill Clinton.  (CNN) -- In this age of electronic media communications, Americans are increasingly confronted in their living rooms -- and even on their cell phones -- with information about and images of genocide and mass atrocities virtually anywhere they occur.  This instantaneous media communication has sensitized many Americans to the suffering of people in all corners of the globe. The Internet has proved to be a powerful tool for organizing broad-based responses to genocide and mass atrocities, as we have seen in response to the crisis in Darfur.  With all of this information written and broadcast about the horrors of genocide and mass atrocities around the world, why do they continue? And as public citizens, public officials and policymakers, how can we prevent this horrendous crime that assaults our humanitarian values and threatens our national security?  Last year, we agreed to co-chair the Genocide Prevention Task Force, which was jointly convened by the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, The American Academy of Diplomacy and the United States Institute of Peace. (The final report is to be released next week.)  The idea for the task force arose out of a desire by each of these institutions to reach beyond their individual capabilities and build a practical framework that could help the U.S. government better respond to threats of genocide and mass atrocities. Our challenge was to match words to deeds and stop allowing the unacceptable. That task is in fact one of the most persistent puzzles of our times.  Many people ask: Why do genocides and mass atrocities happen?  There is no consensus as to the causes of genocide and mass atrocities, nor is there one commonly agreed-upon theory that explains the key catalysts, motivations or mechanisms that lead to them. History has shown that genocide and mass atrocities manifest themselves in highly variable ways, and we should not assume that future perpetrators will follow old patterns.  However, there are warning signs. Genocide is not the inevitable result of \"ancient hatreds\" or irrational leaders. It requires planning and is carried out systematically. But that fact also means that there are ways to recognize its signs and symptoms, and viable options to prevent it at every turn, if we are committed and prepared.  Our report recommends a number of distinct but interrelated areas where the United States government can develop and deploy more effective strategies to identify and pursue opportunities for prevention of genocide and mass atrocities:  First, we believe that leadership is an indispensable ingredient. Nothing is more central to preventing genocide than leadership -- from the president, Congress and the American people. Making progress requires leaders to summon political will not only after a crisis strikes, but also before one emerges.  Second is the importance of early warning. It is critical for policymakers to have good analysis of areas where there is a high risk of genocide or organized violence in order to design effective strategies and spur action. By improving the accuracy of warnings, we will find greater opportunities for preventive action.  Early prevention can avert a crisis. Many countries are vulnerable to extreme violence. By engaging leaders, institutions and civil society at an early stage, the United States can help countries steer clear of these dangers.  Preventive diplomacy is critical to halt and reverse escalation. Even when signs of preparation for genocide are apparent, there are opportunities to alter leaders' decisions and interrupt their plans. By improving our crisis response system, we will be better prepared to mount coherent, carefully calibrated and timely preventive diplomatic strategies.  A willingness to utilize military options to stop ongoing atrocities when prevention efforts have failed is crucial. U.S. military assets can also play an important role in supporting and providing credibility to options short of the use of force, including by deterring violence through military presence or threat.  Lastly, we cite the power of international action. The United States has an interest in promoting a system of international norms and institutions that averts potential genocide and mass atrocities before they occur, stops them quickly and effectively when they occur, helps societies rebuild in their wake and holds perpetrators accountable. By working in partnership with others in the global community, the United States will multiply its positive impact.  We do not underestimate the challenge. We understand that the next president will face many pressing international priorities, as well as real limitations of time and resources. But we believe that preventing genocide is possible, and that striving to do so is imperative, both for our national interests and for our leadership position in the world. Our report seeks to honor the memory of past victims of genocide and mass atrocities by encouraging future action.  The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Madeleine K. Albright and William S. Cohen.

{"article": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Obama on Friday resumed -- with expanded legal protections -- the Bush administration's controversial system of military trials for some Guantanamo Bay detainees.  President Obama says the commissions are OK, \"provided that they are properly structured and administered.\"  On the heels of Obama's shift this week to block the release of photos showing prisoners allegedly being abused by U.S. personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan, the military commissions announcement further infuriated the president's most ardent supporters while winning cautionary praise from some of his political foes.  Obama said he supports the idea of the military commissions but opposes the version of the law that had been governing such trials in recent years: the Military Commissions Act put in place under the Bush administration in 2006, but subsequently struck down as unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.  The president said military commissions \"are appropriate for trying enemies who violate the laws of war, provided that they are properly structured and administered.\" But, he said, the 2006 act \"failed to establish a legitimate legal framework and undermined our capability to ensure swift and certain justice against those detainees.\"  He said he plans to enhance due process rights for detainees held at the U.S. facility in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, in order to improve the widely criticized approach created by his predecessor.  Statements that have been obtained from detainees through interrogation and cruel treatment, such as waterboarding, will no longer be admitted as evidence before the commissions, Obama said, and hearsay evidence will be limited.  The revised system also will give detainees greater latitude in selecting legal representation and afford basic protections to those who refuse to testify. Military commission judges also will be able to establish the jurisdiction of their own courts.  \"These reforms will begin to restore the commissions as a legitimate forum for prosecution, while bringing them in line with the rule of law,\" Obama said.  He said he plans to ask Congress to enact other reforms to the 2006 law.  Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, applauded his former opponent.  \"Today's announcement is a step -- but only a step -- toward a comprehensive detainee policy that will deal with the detainees held at Guantanamo and elsewhere in a fashion that both accords with our values and protects our national security,\" McCain said in a written statement.  But Obama's announcement infuriated some of his core supporters -- with the revisions hardly calming the concerns of groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union.  The ACLU chided the military commission decision as \"a striking blow to due process and the rule of law.\"  \"These military commissions are inherently illegitimate, unconstitutional and incapable of delivering outcomes we can trust,\" said Anthony D. Romero, the group's executive director.  \"Tweaking the rules of these failed tribunals so that they provide 'more due process' is absurd; there is no such thing as 'due process light.' \" he said. \"If the administration's proposed rules really bring these proceedings in line with constitutional requirements, there is no reason not to use our tried and true justice system. If they don't, these tribunals have no place in our democracy.\"  White House spokesman Robert Gibbs countered that military commissions have a long history in the United States.  \"First and foremost, the president of the United States is going to do what he believes is in the best security interest of the people of the United States,\" Gibbs told reporters.  Obama suspended the military commissions by signing an executive order on his third day in office, the same day he signed an order to close the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo within a year and announced a 120-day review of the whole process. The review deadline is next week.  Gibbs said he does not know where and how trials for alleged terrorists will unfold on American soil. Nor did he disclose how many suspects would face legal proceedings under the revised commissions. Three Guantanamo detainees' cases have gone through the commission so far.  The Bush administration established the military trial system after the U.S. military began capturing detainees in Afghanistan in late 2001. The next year, it opened the Guantanamo facility, saying suspects were treated properly and received due process through the system.  But legal organizations and human rights agencies have repeatedly challenged the system on grounds that detainees were mistreated.  One lawyer representing a client at Guantanamo said closing the detention facility, which Obama is advocating, is a \"meaningless gesture\" if the military commissions continue.  \"The military commissions are fundamentally flawed and can't be fixed,\" said Army Maj. Jon S. Jackson, a lawyer for Mustafa al-Hawsawi, one of five 9/11 defendants charged in the military commission process.  Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the self-confessed mastermind of the 9/11 attacks, is the most high-profile of those defendants.", "Q": ["Q: What does Obama revive? A:", "Q: What did the ACLU call the move?

{"article": " -- Intensifying violence, food shortages and widespread drought are driving an increasing number of Somalis to seek asylum in Yemen, the United Nations' refugee agency said Tuesday.  A man brandishes a knife while others carry old notes during a demonstration against record-high inflation.  More than 15,000 refugees have arrived in the Yemeni port city of Aden since January, compared with 7,166 people in the first four months of 2007, according to a spokesperson for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.  Many of those seeking asylum brave treacherous boat trips across the Gulf of Aden. Consequently, the number of boats landing in Aden has jumped from 60 to 361 since January while the number of fatalities has remained constant, according to UNHCR.  The agency attributed the surge to strife in Somalia, where riots continued in the capital city of Mogadishu for the second day Tuesday. According to news reports, Somali soldiers killed at least two people Monday during the protests over rising food prices.  Watch protesters take to the streets \u00bb  Somali refugees pay as much as $150 to cross the Gulf of Aden in search of asylum. Because of its proximity to the war-torn country, Yemen is a common destination for Somalis fleeing economic hardship, famine and war.  Yemen is also an attractive location because Somalis receive automatic refugee status in the fellow Muslim country. New smuggling routes across the Red Sea have also led to increased numbers of refugees in Yemen, according to the UNHCR.  Refugees often die before reaching Yemen because of dangerous sea conditions and overcrowded vessels. Others die at the hands of their smugglers, who order the passengers to jump overboard when the Yemeni coast guard approaches the vessel.  Yemen's coast guard stepped up patrols of its coastline this year in an attempt to deter smugglers, according to the UNHCR, which operates shelters and reception centers for refugees in Yemen. The coast guard has also seized boats and given them Somali fishermen affected by the 2004 tsunami.", "Q": ["Q: What is the surge of refugees to Yemen attributed to?

{"article": "RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (CNN) -- A Brazilian supreme court judge on Tuesday suspended a lower court's order that would have given custody of a 9-year-old boy to the U.S. Consulate in Rio de Janeiro, where he was to be reunited with his American father.  David Goldman has been fighting for custody of his son, Sean, since the boy's mother took him to Brazil in 2004.  Judge Marco Aurelio argued against taking Sean Richard Goldman from what has been his home for almost five years to the United States \"in an abrupt manner.\"  Doing so, he wrote in his order published on the court's Web site, could subject the boy to psychological harm.  The decision, which means the entire Brazilian supreme court will take up the case, comes a day after a superior court justice ordered Sean taken Wednesday to the U.S. Consulate in Rio and handed over to his father, David Goldman, who arrived Tuesday from New Jersey to pick up his son.  The two were separated in June 2004 when the boy's Brazilian mother, Bruna Bianchi Carneiro Ribeiro, told Goldman -- to whom she was then married -- that she was taking the boy on a two-week vacation to Brazil.  Watch Goldman describe his fight to get his son back \u00bb  Mother and son never returned. Instead, Bianchi stayed in Brazil, where she divorced Goldman and married a Brazilian lawyer.  But in September, Bianchi's death during childbirth led Goldman to renew his efforts to regain custody of their son.  Sean, who has been living with his half-sister and his stepfather, was to have spent a 30-day adaptation period in the United States before his father gained full custody.  That prospect sparked outrage from an attorney representing the boy's Brazilian relatives. \"The child wasn't heard,\" lawyer Sergio Tostes said. \"The child said many times that he wanted to stay in Brazil. This is not human, and it is a cruelty.\"  The case has attracted high-level attention. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton referred to the case Monday, telling reporters, \"I also wanted just to take this opportunity to recognize the decision by the Brazilian federal court today ordering a young American boy, Sean Goldman, to be reunited with his father, David. It's taken a long time for this day to come, but we will work with the Goldman family and the Brazilian government, with the goal of ensuring this young boy's return.\"  David Goldman's attorney, Patricia Apy, did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment.

{"article": "HOHENWALD, Tennessee (CNN) -- A pair of African elephants tramps through lush vegetation, stopping to scoop dust with their trunks and toss it onto their backs for protection from the summer sun.  Tarra, who was a year old when Buckley met her, was the inspiration for The Elephant Sanctuary.  Meanwhile, two others submerge their massive forms to splash and dip in the waters of a muddy pond.  It's a scene that could have been pulled from a nature documentary. But it takes place in an unlikely spot: a 2,700-acre sanctuary in rural Tennessee.  It's not where nature intended the animals to be, roaming free in the vast expanses of subtropical Africa and Asia.  But for most of them, it's a life far apart from the ones they once lived.  Tarra lived in the back of a truck at a tire store.  Shirley performed at a circus until she broke her leg on a chain. Then, she was moved to the freak show.  And Sissy was treated like a killer. She crushed a handler in her enclosure at a Texas zoo where video shows she'd been beaten into submission with ax handles.  \"We consider all of these elephants to be rescue elephants, because they are taken out of that environment that is not healthy for them,\" said Carol Buckley, co-founder of the Elephant Sanctuary.  Founded in 1995 on 112 acres about 30 miles southwest of Nashville, the sanctuary is now the largest natural refuge of its kind in the United States. Twenty-four elephants, most of them sick, old or abused, have lived at the sanctuary; it is currently home to 15 African and Asian elephants.  It's a place where elephants can roam freely, largely feed and shelter themselves and interact with others, often after years living alone in captivity.  But Buckley and Scott Blais, the nonprofit sanctuary's co-founder, are very clear about what it's not. The sanctuary is not a zoo.  Visitors aren't allowed onto the property to view the elephants, and only a handful of media members are able to visit each year, in an effort to make the animals' lives as natural as possible.  \"In order to accommodate the public, you would have to take away from the elephants,\" Buckley said. \"People have their own emotions, that energy,\" Buckley said. \"If you feel fear and they get close, they're going to get hit with your energy.  For Buckley, the journey to running the sanctuary -- which operates on private donations and corporate sponsorships -- started with Tarra.  Studying to be a circus trainer, she bought the elephant, then just a year old, and trained her to perform. But as the years passed and the relationship between animal and trainer strengthened, Buckley came to believe that captivity, particularly in a traveling circus, was no life for an elephant.  \"I didn't realize that elephants in captivity were suffering and that to train and dominate an elephant was really breaking their spirit,\" she said. \"When you come to love elephants, when you really come to understand them and love them, you want more for them.  \"And when you learn how elephants live in the wild, it just makes sense that you would want to create a space that resembles that so elephants can just be elephants.\"  From years in the circus and in zoos, Buckley and Tarra made their way to a breeding program at a Canadian wildlife safari, where they met Blais. It was then that the idea for the Elephant Sanctuary was born.  \"We started talking about elephants in captivity and what we could do and what we should be doing for them, what they truly deserved,\" Blais said.  At the preserve, the elephants feed themselves primarily by grazing -- the Asian elephants eat as much as 100 pounds of grass a day -- supplemented with grains and vitamins from the staff. They share space with deer, wild turkey, raccoons, skunks and other native Tennessee animals.  Life in a circus, and in most zoos, is abusive to elephants, highly intelligent and social animals who, in the wild, may roam dozens of miles in a single day, the pair said. Research has shown that elephants, like humans, can suffer post-traumatic stress disorder after living in harsh or abusive conditions.  Watch more on life at the Elephant Sanctuary. \u00bb  \"Typically, when elephants are in captivity, they're under a lot of stress,\" Blais said. \"Their entire life is abnormal; it's unnatural, and that can often lead to aggression.  \"Some will resign themselves and just kind of end up in this blank space, and others will act out, just venting their frustrations, but it's because of what captivity offers or what captivity doesn't offer them.\"  The elephants generally arrive at the sanctuary in one of two ways: Either the government finds that an owner is abusing the animals and seizes them, or the owners approach the sanctuary on their own, wanting a better life for the animals.

{"article": "Mexico City, Mexico (CNN) -- The Mexican government has apologized to the families of two students killed early Friday who officials initially said were drug gang members.  Jorge Antonio Mercado Alonso, 23, and Javier Francisco Arredondo Verdugo, 24, were mechanical engineering graduate students at the Technological Institute of Higher Learning of Monterrey, the Mexican Interior Ministry said Sunday in its apology for the shootings.  Mexican soldiers chasing criminals who had fired on an army patrol shot and killed the students, the Interior Ministry said. Some of the criminals had fled onto the college campus.  \"The Mexican government expresses its most deeply felt condolences to the families,\" the Interior Ministry said in a release on its Web page.  The federal government will intensify its investigation to find out what happened, the ministry said.  On Friday, Mexican officials had said the two dead men were part of the criminal gang that shot at the soldiers. University officials also said Friday that all students were safe.  That account changed Saturday, when Mercado's mother tried to call him after finding out about the campus shootout. When she couldn't reach him, she traveled to Monterrey, where she identified her son's body, said the campus rector, Rafael Rangel Sostman.  \"I'm certain he is with God,\" said the mother, Rosa Elvia Mercado Alonso.  The school's rector blamed himself for the mix-up in identities.  \"I offer a public apology and take responsibility for having given information that ended up not being correct,\" Rangel said. \"I want to offer my most deeply felt condolences to the family of our two students and offer them our support in this difficult situation.\"  Both men were scholarship students, the college said.  Monterrey is in Nuevo Leon, one of two states in northeastern Mexico where drug cartel members blocked roads with hijacked vehicles Thursday and Friday to prevent military reinforcements from arriving. The criminals also set up roadblocks in neighboring Tamaulipas state.  Three presumed gang members and one soldier were killed in various skirmishes over the two-day period, officials said.  The area, which borders Texas, has seen bloody fighting between the Zetas and Gulf cartels after a recent gangland slaying. Hours-long gun battles are common, and U.S. officials were recently forced to temporarily close the consulate in the city of Reynosa.  Mexico has been gripped in massive drug-related bloodshed since President Felipe Calderon declared war on the cartels shortly after coming into office in December 2006. Much of the violence has taken place around Ciudad Juarez, across the border from El Paso, Texas.  There are no official government tallies, but more than 16,000 people are estimated to have died in the drug wars. The vast majority of the deaths are among reputed criminals, with some police and military also being killed. Relatively few of the deaths have been civilians.  Even so, the United States and Canada have issued travel warnings, particularly along the border area. The Texas Department of Public Safety took the unprecedented step this year of recommending that students on spring break not go to border areas inside Mexico.  News of the violence and the travel warnings apparently have had an effect. Mexicans say tourism along the border has declined significantly this year.", "Q": ["Q: Where did the criminals flee to?

{"article": "Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Doctors completed an autopsy of Moammar Gadhafi on Sunday, with the chief pathologist confirming the former Libyan leader died of a gunshot wound to the head.  Dr. Othman el-Zentani would not disclose whether findings revealed if Gadhafi suffered the wound in crossfire or at close-range -- a key question that has prompted the United Nations and international human rights groups to call for an investigation into the final moments of the late Libyan strongman's life.  Doctors performed the autopsy at a Misrata hospital in the presence of officials from the prosecutor's office, Zentani said. Autopsies were also conducted on the bodies of Gadhafi's son, Mutassim, and his former defense minister, Abu Baker Yunis.  No foreign or independent officials were present, Zentani said.  The autopsy report will go to the attorney general's office before it is released to the public, he said.  Meanwhile, the three bodies would likely return to a cold storage unit at a Misrata meat market for public viewing, Zentani said.  Long lines of people turned up all weekend long to view the corpses.  Gadhafi's family issued a statement Friday calling on the United Nations and Amnesty International to push Libya's new leadership \"to hand over the bodies of the martyrs of their tribe so they can be buried according to Islamic rites,\" a pro-Gadhafi TV station reported.  Gadhafi's death Thursday solidified the power of the National Transitional Council, which marked the country's liberation on Sunday in the eastern city of Benghazi, where the uprising started.  But uncertainty was still swirling Sunday about the death of the Libyan leader, who Libyan and world powers wanted to capture and prosecute for war crimes.  Leaders of Libya's interim government have said Gadhafi was killed in crossfire after fighters captured him Thursday.  But others have questioned that account.  Peter Bouckaert, Human Rights Watch's emergencies director, told CNN that fighting had ended when Gadhafi was cornered in a drainage ditch. He said crowds beat Gadhafi in what was a \"humiliating end\" for the former dictator.  \"When he left the area, he was very much alive,\" Bouckaert said. \"There's no reason why he should have been subjected to this kind of mob justice.\"  An amateur video distributed by the Reuters news agency Sunday showed NTC fighters congratulating a man the fighters say killed Gadhafi. CNN could not independently verify that claim.  The video, purportedly recorded near an ambulance carrying Gadhafi's body, shows a jubilant group of fighters pouring water on a man's head.  \"He is the one who killed him,\" one man says, pointing.  \"He killed him in front of me, I swear to God,\" another man chimes in.  A lawyer for Gadhafi's son Saadi, who fled in September to Niger, issued a statement Sunday saying, \"Saadi Gadhafi is shocked and outraged by the vicious brutality which accompanied the murders of his father and brother.\"  \"The contradictory statements issued by the NTC excusing these barbaric executions and the grotesque abuse of the corpses make it clear that no person affiliated with the former regime will receive a fair trial in Libya nor will they receive justice for crimes committed against them,\" the statement said.  Mahmoud Jibril, chairman of the NTC's executive board, has said Gadhafi's right arm was wounded when a gunbattle erupted between the fighters and Gadhafi loyalists as his captors attempted to load him into a vehicle. More shooting erupted as the vehicle drove away, and Gadhafi was shot in the head, dying moments before arriving at a hospital in Misrata, Jibril said, citing the city's coroner.  The United Nations human rights office and activist groups like Amnesty and Human Rights Watch have called for a probe into Gadhafi's death.  The United States supports those investigation requests, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told CNN's \"State of the Union\" Sunday.  \"As Libyans move into the future once again, they need to do so with a sense of unity and reconciliation. They need to hold each other accountable. Those who do not have blood on their hands must be made to feel safe and included, regardless of whether or not they supported Gadhafi in the past,\" she said. \"So we believe in the rule of law, and accountability, and such an investigation would contribute to that.\"  U.N. human rights spokesman Rupert Colville told reporters in Geneva on Friday that there were \"at least two cell-phone videos, one showing (Gadhafi) alive and one showing him dead.\"  \"Taken together, these videos are very disturbing,\" he said.  \"We believe there is a need for an investigation and more details are needed to ascertain whether he was killed in the fighting or after his capture.", "Q": ["Q: Who is supporting calls for an investigation into Gadhafi's death?

{"article": "NEW YORK (CNN) -- John and Elizabeth Calvert enjoyed the good life on Hilton Head Island in South Carolina, friends said, but they were growing more and more suspicious of the way their business books were being handled. Things weren't adding up. Money appeared to be missing.  John and Elizabeth Calvert are featured on missing persons posters on Hilton Head Island, South Carolina.  So they scheduled a meeting with accountant Dennis Ray Gerwing to address their concerns, recalled one close friend, Nancy Cappelmann.  The Calverts said they were meeting with Gerwing at his offices in the upscale resort community at 6 p.m. last March 3, she added.  It would be the last time anyone would see or hear from the couple.  The Calverts lived part-time on their yacht, docked at the island's Harbor Town Yacht Basin, the same marina where they managed boat slips. They spent the rest of the year in Savannah, Georgia, and also had a home in Atlanta.  They were an active, affluent couple in their mid-40s, and their absence was quickly noticed. On the evening of March 3, 2008, the evening they were to meet with their accountant, both of the Calverts' phones were turned off. Family members said it was very unusual for either John or Elizabeth Calvert to shut off their cell phones.   Watch an update on the case \u00bb  Family and friends called police and reported the Calverts missing on March 4, after they missed appointments and still couldn't be reached.  \"I was supposed to meet John that night and he is never late, so when 20 minutes went by, I got worried and called his cell, but it went straight to voicemail, like it was turned off,\" Cappelmann said. She was a good friend of the couple's and worked at one of their harbor businesses.  Police and search teams scoured the island. Divers and dogs searched the harbor and found nothing.  The Calverts' small airplane was still at the island's airport and provided no clues. Their 2006 Mercedes Benz was found parked at a hotel in Palmetto Dunes, a gated community six miles from where the Calverts' yacht was docked. The Mercedes also contained no forensic clues.  In reconstructing the Calverts' last days, investigators concluded that Gerwing was worth a deeper look. They now say they believe the 54-year-old accountant was the last person to see the Calverts alive.  Gerwing ran the management company that kept the books on the Calverts' four businesses on Hilton Head Island. Authorities were already looking into possible financial improprieties involving the company, The Club Group.  They named Gerwing as a person of interest in the case about a week after the couple disappeared. An internal audit later revealed that Gerwing had embezzled $2.1 million from the Calverts and others, police said.  Gerwing committed suicide within hours of learning he was a person of interest, slashing his neck and legs with a steak knife, authorities said. He also left behind suicide notes with vague references to the Calvert case, said Beaufort County Sheriff P.J. Tanner.  Tanner said the notes indicated some acknowledgement of responsibility for his actions, but didn't say specifically what those actions might have been.  Police also gathered circumstantial evidence that seemed to point to Gerwing, including drop cloths large enough to use to wrap bodies and latex gloves purchased on the day the Calverts disappeared.  In addition, police learned that Gerwing's cell phone had been turned off for 12 hours after he was scheduled to meet with the Calverts.  If Gerwing were alive, Tanner said, police wouldn't have enough corroborating evidence to name him a suspect and arrest him.  Police executed search warrants on Gerwing's office, home and vehicles and found soil in Gerwing's kitchen. Investigators hope analysis of the dirt might provide clues to the origin of the dirt and a new location to continue searching for John and Elizabeth Calvert.  Friends and family are offering a $65,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the person or persons responsible for the Calverts' disappearance.  Police urge anyone with information about John and Elizabeth Calvert  to call the tip line at (843) 524-2777. Police also are seeking help from anyone who saw the Calverts' 2006 Mercedes Benz E320, Georgia Tech license plate GT821B on or about March 3, 2008.", "Q": ["Q: who are growing?

{"article": "ORLANDO, Florida (CNN) -- Remains found last week in a wooded area have been identified as belonging to missing Florida toddler Caylee Anthony, authorities said Friday.  Caylee Anthony, 2, had been missing since June in a case that has received national attention.  The cause of the child's death will be listed as homicide by undetermined means, said Jan Garavaglia, medical examiner for Orange County, Florida. She said she does not expect enough additional evidence to surface for that finding to be revised.  The remains were identified through DNA testing, comparing a sample from the remains to a sample known to be from Caylee. Some of the remains had been sent to the FBI lab in Quantico, Virginia, for testing.  The skull was found December 11 a half-mile from the home of Caylee's grandparents, where the girl and her mother, Casey Anthony, 22, lived before the girl disappeared. She was last seen in June.  Casey Anthony faces charges including first-degree murder in the case.  Watch a Nancy Grace video tribute to Caylee Anthony \u00bb  Orange County Sheriff's Capt. Angelo Nieves said Thursday that searchers at the site had found \"significant skeletal remains\" since the discovery of the skull.  A \"large percentage\" of Caylee's skeleton has been recovered, Garavaglia said Friday. The bones showed no sign of trauma before death.  A child's skeleton has many more bones than an adult's, she said, and not all are fully developed. Some of the bones recovered are no larger than a pebble, she said.  Watch the medical examiner discuss her findings \u00bb  Garavaglia said the manner of Caylee's death -- an opinion based on factors including an examination of the body and circumstantial evidence -- was determined to be homicide.  Caylee's grandmother Cindy Anthony was notified of the test results by the medical examiner's office, Garavaglia said.  Officials at the Orange County Corrections Department said Casey Anthony was notified of the results by a chaplain about 1:45 p.m., per jail policy. One of Casey Anthony's defense attorneys, Jose Garcia, entered the jail earlier, corrections officials said in a written statement.  \"Due to happenstance, not policy, attorney Garcia was not in the presence of the inmate when the notification was made,\" the statement said. \"We will not be commenting on the demeanor of inmate Anthony or her reaction to the news.\"  The Anthony family's pastor, Thomas Shane Stutzman of Eastside Baptist Church, arrived at the jail about 2 p.m. but left 19 minutes later because Casey Anthony had refused his visit, as she was meeting with Garcia at the time, jail officials said.  Casey Anthony could face a sentence of life in prison if convicted. Prosecutors said this month that they will not seek the death penalty against her.  Garavaglia would not disclose specific information regarding the remains other than to say they were completely \"skeletonized.\" Toxicology tests on the remains are pending, she said.  \"Our number one priority from day one was to locate little Caylee Anthony,\" Orange County Sheriff Kevin Beary said. \"We have stayed the course, and we will continue to do so until we have thoroughly completed our investigation into this tragedy.\"  The sheriff grew emotional while responding to a reporter's question about the effect of the case on him personally.  \"Having a kid... I've raised two girls, goodness gracious,\" Beary said, his voice breaking. \"The bottom line is, no child should have to go through this.\"  The case has left an \"open wound\" in the community, he said, but he thinks closure will not come until after trial.  George and Cindy Anthony, Casey Anthony's parents, did not give up hope that Caylee was still alive until they were notified of the test results, their attorney, Brad Conway, said Friday. He took no questions but read from a statement.  \"They now know that their precious granddaughter is safe and hope that she will serve as the angel that protects thousands of missing children and their families,\" he said, adding that the Anthonys want \"the same answers as everyone who has been assigned to investigate and prosecute this case\" and will be available to authorities.  \"As you can imagine, the Anthonys are grieving deeply over this loss,\" he said. \"Please respect their privacy and understand they will stand together as a family in order to get through this.... This is a tragic moment in the lives of good and honorable people. Please treat them respectfully so they can grieve with dignity over the loss of this precious child, Caylee Marie Anthony.\"  On Thursday, the sheriff's office said that the utility worker who found the skull December 11 had called police three times -- August 11, 12 and 13 -- regarding the site where the remains were found.  That utility worker, Roy Kronk, came forward Friday. Reading from a statement, he said that \"back in August of this year, I previously reported to Crimeline and to the sheriff's communications center that I had spotted something suspicious, a bag in the same area.\"  \"I have been and will continue to cooperate fully with the ongoing investigation by the sheriff's office and the FBI,\" Kronk said.  He refused to provide details of what he saw at the site where the remains were found.  Watch Kronk talk about his calls to police \u00bb  His attorney, David Evans, said Kronk \"has no connection whatsoever to this case, has no connection whatsoever to the Anthony family or any of the proceedings that have gone on before. He is here as a concerned citizen and no more. Those who have specified to the contrary could not be more wrong.\"  Evans said Kronk was asking for privacy for his co-workers, who have been the subject of \"intrusive news-gathering activities.\" Some of those colleagues, he said, \"protected his privacy and sacrificed their own in doing so.\"  Kronk will not be granting interviews at this time, Evans said.  Police said Thursday that in his first call August 11, the worker reported seeing a gray bag on the side of the road. A deputy responded, Nieves said, but the worker was no longer at the scene, and the deputy did not see the bag.  On August 12, the worker called a police crime line. The call was sent to a detective, who told the meter reader that the area had been searched and cleared by cadaver dogs, police said.  On August 13, the worker reported finding a bag in a swampy area, and a deputy was dispatched. The deputy looked at the area but found nothing, thinking the \"bag\" may have just been trash, Nieves said.  The meter reader revisited the site last week, apparently while working in the area, authorities said, and found the skull.  The site was searched earlier, Beary said, but was flooded at the time.  Nieves said Thursday that police were conducting a thorough review of the tips and their response but emphasized that the meter reader has been cooperative and is not a suspect.  Beary acknowledged Friday that there were questions surrounding those tips but said the only way to find the answers was to conduct an investigation.

{"article": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- A portrait painted 400 years ago and kept anonymously in an Irish home for much of the time since is now believed to be the only painting of William Shakespeare created during his lifetime.  The portrait of William Shakespeare is thought to be the \"only\" portrait painted during his lifetime.  The image reveals a wealthy Shakespeare of high social status, contradicting the popular view of a struggling playwright of humble status, according to Stanley Wells, a professor who chairs London's Shakespeare Birthplace Trust.  Wells, a distinguished Shakespeare scholar, arranged for three years of research and scientific testing which confirmed it was painted around 1610, when Shakespeare would have been 46 years old.  \"A rather young looking 46, it has to be said,\" Wells said. Shakespeare died in 1616.  The Cobbe portrait -- named after the Irish family that owns the painting -- shows Shakespeare with rosy cheeks, a full head of hair, and a reddish brown beard.  The most common portrait of Shakespeare is a gray image showing a bald Bard with a small mustache and beard, and bags under his eyes.  The identity of the man in the portrait was lost over the centuries -- until Alec Cobbe saw a portrait from Washington's Folger Shakespeare Library. That painting, which fell into disfavor as a Shakespeare portrait about 70 years ago, turned out to be one of four copies of Cobbe's portrait.  The portrait \"shows a man wearing expensive costuming, including a very beautifully painted ruff of Italian lacework which would have been very expensive,\" Wells said.  \"It establishes, for me, that Shakespeare in his later years was a rather wealthy, a rather well affluent member of aristocratic circles in the society of his time,\" Wells said.  \"There's been too much of a tendency to believe that Shakespeare, being the son of a glover, coming for a small town in the middle of England, that he necessarily retained a rather humble status throughout his life.\"  Wells reads even more into what he sees in Shakespeare's newly-found face.  \"I think it's plausible as a portrait as a good listener, of somebody who would have been capable of writing the plays, clearly the face of a man of high intelligence,\" he said.  \"It's the face of a man, I think, who betrays a good deal of wisdom in his features. But, of course, as somebody (King Duncan) says in Shakespeare's story Macbeth, 'there's no art to find the mind's construction in the face.'\"  It should be noted that Shakespeare's King Duncan paid a price for judging Macbeth to have the face of an honorable man. Macbeth later murdered the king.  The public can read Shakespeare's face from the original painting at Shakespeare Birthplace Trust in Stratford-upon-Avon where it goes on display for several months starting April 23.  The portrait then returns to the Cobbe family, which inherited it when an ancestor married England's Earl of Southampton -- a friend of Shakespeare who likely commissioned its painting.", "Q": ["Q: What he painted in 1610?

{"article": " -- A NASA satellite crashed back to Earth about three minutes after launch early Tuesday, officials said.  NASA launches a rocket from California's Vandenberg Air Force Base on Tuesday.  \"We could not make orbit,\" NASA program manager John Brunschwyler said. \"Initial indications are the vehicle did not have enough [force] to reach orbit and landed just short of Antarctica in the ocean.\"  \"Certainly for the science community, it's a huge disappointment.\"  The satellite, which would have monitored greenhouse gases to study how they affect the Earth's climate, was launched on a Taurus XL rocket from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California at 1:55 a.m. PT (4:55 a.m. ET).  But the payload fairing -- a clamshell-shaped structure that allows the satellite to travel through space -- failed to separate from the rocket, NASA officials said.  See video of launch \u00bb  The weight of the fairing caused the rocket and the satellite to come crashing down to Earth about three minutes later.  A team of investigators will look into what caused the payload fairing to fail to separate.  \"We'll get back to flying at a pace that allows us to do so successfully,\" said Chuck Dovale, NASA Launch Director, at a press briefing after the failed launch.  The $273 million satellite, called the Orbiting Carbon Observatory, would have collected global measurements of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the Earth's atmosphere to help better forecast changes in carbon-dioxide levels and their effect on the Earth's climate.  Carbon dioxide is considered a greenhouse gas because it traps heat, which scientists believe contributes to the warming of the planet. Carbon dioxide also absorbs wavelengths of light, and the NASA observatory would have measured levels of the gas partly by using instruments to analyze light reflected off the Earth.  The OCO also would have provided information about CO2 \"sinks\" -- areas, like oceans or landfills, that absorb and store carbon dioxide. NASA officials said all measurements would be combined with the findings of ground observation stations, providing a more complete account of the human and natural sources of CO2.  The OCO project took eight years to develop, said Michael Frelich, director of the NASA Earth Science Division.

{"article": "LAS VEGAS, Nevada (CNN) -- The theater was packed as Garth Brooks shared stories about why he decided to officially step out of retirement after nine years.  Garth Brooks played two secret concerts in Vegas earlier this summer. Now he's signed on for an engagement.  Camera crews and journalists filled the front section. Executives flanked the sides. And then smack dab in the middle of the audience was a row of chefs, enthusiastically applauding in their toques and kitchen whites.  Yes, the media was buzzing about the much-anticipated announcement, but hotel employees at the Wynn Encore in Las Vegas were equally excited -- maybe even more so, because of the part they played in persuading the country music superstar to enter into a five-year weekend residency at the establishment beginning December 11.  This summer, as the media threw itself head-first into the death of Michael Jackson, the Oklahoma native quietly took the stage at the 1,500-seat Encore Theater in two hush-hush shows attended by hotel workers. One was an intimate acoustic performance; the other a concert with his full band.  He sang. He charmed. He won over staffers who never thought they'd be caught dead tapping their toes to country music. And that, ladies and gentleman, exemplifies the uncanny ability of Garth Brooks to connect with human beings, and explains why he -- not Michael Jackson -- is the best-selling solo artist of all time in any genre. (You can look it up.)  \"I think my gift truly is I'm an average guy. What I like, an average guy likes. It's that simple. The music that I love, I find that most guys around me love, too,\" he told CNN in his dressing room after Thursday's news conference in Las Vegas.  There's a big old-fashioned star on the door that says \"Garth Brooks.\" It suits him. Even though he's pushed boundaries and rewritten rules in the music industry, he's still an old-fashioned guy with old-fashioned values -- work hard, stay humble and family first. It's the latter that led to his decision to hang up his mic and his Stetson in 2000.  \"We were retiring because I gotta get back to Oklahoma and raise my girls. Sandy and I were getting a divorce at the time, so I couldn't expect her to do my job for me any longer,\" he said. \"We told the people that's what I'm going to do, and the people -- 99 percent of them -- said, 'Go. Go do what you gotta do. We'll be here when you get back,' and we'll see if they are.\"  Watch Brooks talk about new course \u00bb  Brooks' three daughters -- Taylor, August and Allie -- are now 17, 15 and 13. When he retired, he famously stated that he wanted to be able to drive his kids to school every day. His new Friday-through-Sunday gig will allow him to keep his pledge of seeing them off to class until they head to college.  Of course, the commute from his farm in Owasso, Oklahoma, to Vegas will be made a little faster with his new private jet -- an 11-seat Challenger, courtesy of Steve Wynn, the billionaire CEO of Wynn Hotels.  \"I don't know anything about jets,\" Brooks downplayed with a shrug. \"It's got a cool interior, cool paint job, I don't know. But it gets me here (to Vegas), and it gets me home to see my girls. And so in that case, it's fabulous.\"  \"He's been happy being at home, attending every soccer game and knowing what his kids like to eat for breakfast,\" said singer Trisha Yearwood, whom he married in 2005. \"We both came from a family where our parents were there every single day, and so we don't know any other way.\"  On most weekends, Yearwood will be making the two-hour trip to Sin City -- and every now and again, she'll make an appearance with her husband on stage.  \"It's a 'Beauty and the Beast' thing, you know?\" said Brooks. \"I can start a song in one octave and end it up in three keys, not knowing that I've changed. She's precision -- perfect with feeling -- and that's impressive to anybody you bring out.\"  From time to time, Brooks will bring out special guests, but for the most part, it's a one-man show -- just him, an acoustic guitar and a bunch of great songs and intimate stories.  And, of course, there's the audience.  \"As long as my gift is here, as long as I open my mouth and it works,\" he said, \"then I think my job is to keep doing it, you know?\"", "Q": ["Q: He's been given what to travel?

{"article": " -- A Florida man is using billboards with an image of the burning World Trade Center to encourage votes for a Republican presidential candidate, drawing criticism for politicizing the 9/11 attacks.  Businessman Mike Meehan says he has put up three billboards such as this one around Orlando, Florida.  \"Please Don't Vote for a Democrat\" reads the type over the picture of the twin towers after hijacked airliners hit them on September, 11, 2001.  Mike Meehan, a St. Cloud, Florida, businessman who paid to post the billboards in the Orlando area, said former President Clinton should have put a stop to Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda before 9/11. He said a Republican president would have done so.  \"I believe 9/11 could have been prevented if we'd had a Republican president at the time,\" Meehan said Wednesday on CNN's \"American Morning.\"  But Democrats and Republicans are saying Meehan shouldn't be using a 9/11 image to make a political point.  \"This is a blatant exploitation of that terrible tragedy for political and, perhaps even worse, personal gain,\" Bill Robinson, the Orange County, Florida, Democratic Party chairman told CNN affiliate WFTV-TV in Orlando.  The local Republican Party called the billboard \"inappropriate,\" according to WFTV.  \"There are many ways to convey the importance of national security in this election without going to extremes, and we encourage a constructive dialogue,\" the Florida Republican Party said in a statement Tuesday.  According to Meehan, President Bush has done \"an excellent job... going after these terrorists.\"  Watch Meehan's take on terrorism and the election \u00bb  \"You got to remember all the... people that George Bush did catch and how much success he did have. And we haven't had an attack on this soil since 9/11,\" Meehan said.  \"Unlike Bill Clinton, who actually had bin Laden right in his hand and through the CIA and other high officials decide to get him go,\" Meehan said.  In a 2006 interview with \"Fox News Sunday,\" Clinton said he authorized the killing of bin Laden in 2000 after the attack on the Navy warship USS Cole in Yemen, but the order was never carried out because U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies refused to certify that bin Laden was behind the Cole attack.  \"I got closer to killing him than anybody has gotten since,\" Clinton said in the 2006 interview.  Meehan also is using the billboard to promote his Web site, the republicansong.com, where he's trying to sell copies of his song, \"Please Don't Vote for a Democrat.\"  The song goes beyond the national security issue, ripping Democrats on taxation and energy issues, too.  \"They want to take the money from the hard workin' man, and give it to the lazy folks that don't give a damn,\" Meehan sings.  Another verse takes on the oil issue.  \"We're not fightin' for oil, we got plenty if we drill it,\" he sings.  The song's not a moneymaker, he said, just an effort to recoup some of what he's invested in the billboards.  A copy of the song on CD cost $5 on the Web site, and the site points out that Meehan can be hired to perform at a \"concert, party, meeting or event.\"  \"I'm willing to pay the cost for the fact that our soldiers that have died protecting this country have paid a heck of a lot more than what these billboards cost,\" Meehan told \"American Morning.\"  Florida resident Mary Anderson told WFTV she doesn't see politics when she's looking at the billboard.  \"Just looking at it, I'm not thinking about Democrat or Republican, I'm thinking about the twin towers and all the people killed,\" she told WFTV.", "Q": ["Q: What did billboards use to encourage GOP votes?
