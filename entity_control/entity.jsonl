Isabelle Hyart lovingly touched the small white coffin of her daughter Chloe as it was taken down to the waiting hearse. Distraught: Isabelle Hyart breaks down in tears as she leaves the funeral of her daughter Chloe . The procession of grieving family and friends follows the coffin of the nine-year-old outside St Peter's Church. Pall bearers carry the coffin of Chloe, who was raped and murdered on April 15, down the steps of the Saint-Pierre Church in Calais, northern France. The murder of Chloe, who was killed by Zbigniew Huminsk, sparked a national outpouring of grief in France. Chloe had been snatched from a French playground in front of her mother Isabelle Hyart's eyes by Zbigniew Huminsk, 38. The young girl was taken from outside her home after she playfully squirted him with a water pistol. Terror-stricken Miss Hyart had tried helplessly to reach her daughter but Huminsk bundled the girl into his car and drove her to woodland where he sexually assaulted and strangled her. He has since confessed to his crimes. . Miss Hyart wept as her daughter was carried out after the ceremony and lovingly touched the small white coffin as it was taken down to the waiting hearse. The distraught mother was comforted by family and friends, including Chloe's father, who all said their final farewells to the young girl. Outside in the Spring sunshine, mourners of all generations stood in silence in tribute to the nine-year-old who was murdered and raped by Huminsk on April 15. This is the last picture of Chloe, taken on the same day she was abducted while she is seated in front of her family home. Schoolgirl killer Zbigniew Huminski (left) did not offer a word of remorse as he was indicted for the kidnap, rape and murder of Chloe (right) News of his appalling crime shocked the country and on Saturday more than 6,000 took to the streets of Calais on Saturday to form a quarter of a mile long 'White March' to pay tribute to Chloe. . Many of those marching for Chloe were her friends at the Balzac Dance Club where last January she had performed in a show with them to raise money for the Red Cross, which helps migrants. . Huminski has a long criminal record in France and Poland, including once attacking a frail woman of 78 with a knife in her home. . The career criminal was sentenced to a year behind bars in March, but under the rules in Poland, he was supposed to take himself to jail. . Instead, he hit the road for France and, under the EU's free movement rules, there was nothing to stop him driving across Europe. . Despite being banned from France for his earlier offences, Huminski was on his way to see his sister in Southampton last Wednesday when he 'stopped for a beer' in Calais. He then carried out the attack on Chloe while drunk. Hundreds attended the funeral of the Calais schoolgirl who was killed in a brutal crime that shocked the country. Inside the packed St Peter's church, broadcast on the screens outside, mourners stood as they listened to the ceremony. Mourners who could not fit inside the packed St Peter's Church in Calais for the ceremony gathered outside. Huge screens had been erected outside the church for family, friends and members of the public to pay tribute to the girl. Friends, family and Calais locals gathered outside the church to say their final farewells to the young victim. Miss Hyart said previously: 'I'm appalled, disgusted. I don't understand why he was in France. And why did he come to Calais? I don't understand how anyone could do that to a child of nine.' . In court the killer did not offer a word of remorse as he was formally charged with a kidnapping, raping and murdering the girl which are likely to see him jailed for life. . Huminski reportedly confessed to murder soon after being arrested close to Chloe's body in remote woodland on the edge of Calais. Deputy mayor Philippe Mignonet had discovered the body after joining the police hunt to find the missing girl. . Speaking in the town hall, he said: 'I saw a red car in the bushes and realised it was the car the police were looking for, so I called the police and three officers turned up. . 'I will never forget, for as long as I live, the terrible image that day. I cannot get it out of my mind. We all feel so sad for the family. It has been a terrible week for our town.' . Describing every parent's worst nightmare, Miss Hyart said the brazen abduction happened in broad daylight on Wednesday when she left her daughter in the playground to pop back inside the flat to change her four-year-old son's clothing. . Miss Hyart wept as she left the funeral ceremony of her daughter surrounded by friends and family. The young girl was snatched from outside her home after she playfully squirted him with a water pistol in front of her terror-stricken mother who is pictured leaving the church with Chloe's father. Miss Hyart is comforted by the father of her deceased daughter at the funeral which was attended by hundreds. Miss Hyart said she was later told by police that Chloe had been raped and then strangled to death in an isolated wood once used as an illegal camp for migrants bound for the UK. Chloe had finished school and had been playing outside before her dance lesson at 4pm. At 2.31pm, her mother proudly posted the photo on Facebook of her daughter", "hypo": ["Mourners gathered at St Peter's in northern France today to say their final farewells to the young victim.

The rest of America fell in love because of what happened after the winning putt was holed. The 79th Masters attracted massive ratings in the USA and there is no surprise in that. They tuned in to watch as perfect a demonstration of sporting endeavour as you will ever behold. But they also tuned in to watch a man with a common touch and a depth of sincerity that reached into the heart of every household. Politicians who try so hard to be popular could learn much from 21-year-old Masters champion Jordan Spieth. The green jackets and dignitaries sitting behind him were enraptured as the winner gave an unscripted speech so gracious and natural you would think that public speaking was his calling rather than the Royal and Ancient game. Jordan Spieth wears his new green jacket after winning the Masters at Augusta on Sunday. Spieth hugs members of his family after securing his first ever major title at Augusta National. Spieth walks back onto the 18th green to formally acknowledge the large crowd watching on. As he stepped off the final green he embraced, in turn, his father Shawn, his mother Chris, his college sweetheart Annie, his brother Steven, who plays college basketball, his grandfather and various friends. And then he remembered his father\u2019s words: \u2018Make sure you say thank you to the people, son.\u2019. So he went back on to the 18th green and formally acknowledged the patrons crammed into every available space. With this victory, Spieth must have killed forever the idea that you have to have a cold heart and a ruthless edge to be a winner. You will not find a single pro on the PGA Tour with a bad word to say about him. There is nothing fake about Jordan Spieth. Texans are supposed to be brash and larger than life, right? This one makes jokes about his receding hairline and dislikes being asked why he comes across as humble because, well, that would not be humble. Listen to Phil Mickelson, the Masters specialist who cheerfully admitted he had been outplayed by a man who had competed at Augusta only once before. \u2018He\u2019s just a class guy in every way and it\u2019s difficult not to root for him,\u2019 said the leftie. Spieth watches his tee shot on the seventh hole during the final round. Spieth gives a fistpump after making a birdie putt on the third green on the final day. \u2018This is a momentous week in the history of our game. Along with Rory McIlroy, Jordan Spieth is going to carry it for the next decade and what an exciting time it promises to be.\u2019. Sir Nick Faldo, on American television, sums up perfectly the feelings of a sport at the end of truly epochal week. Listen to Jack Nicklaus, who posted this tribute: \u2018Congratulations to an exceptionally talented young man. That was an incredible performance. Jordan is so beyond his years. I like everything about him. He\u2019s polite, he\u2019s humble, he handles himself so well, on and off the golf course. And he\u2019s obviously a wonderful player and now a Masters champion.\u2019. The one family member who was not present to enjoy the celebrations was his 14-year-old sister Ellie, who suffers from a neurological disorder that places her on the autism spectrum. Hardly a day goes by when Spieth does not Facetime Ellie and every time they talk she asks him if he has won yet. \u2018I\u2019ll finally be able to tell her yes,\u2019 he said, smiling. When Spieth speaks about Ellie there is no pity or anything maudlin in his voice, only joy, laughter and pride. \u2018I know she was watching on television and I think she\u2019s going to be a bit jealous of us all hugging round the 18th green,\u2019 he said. \u2018She\u2019s going to want a present.\u2019. Golf should not have been Spieth\u2019s game at all. Nobody in the family plays \u2014 they are all big basketball fans. But Spieth was given a set of plastic clubs at the age of four and took it from there. Spieth (front) is presented with his green jacket by last year's Masters champion Bubba Watson. Spieth kisses his girlfriend Annie after a sensational victory at the Masters. Perhaps the only serious criticism he has attracted came when he dropped out of the University of Texas after his first year. It was well-meaning. By the age of 19 he had an amateur record so good he had positively lapped his fellow competitors and done well in the US Open, finishing 21st. But why the hurry? Why not complete his education? Throughout his life Spieth has known exactly what he wants \u2014 from the fact he is still with the girl he met in college to his caddie Michael Greller. He is a maths teacher by trade but Spieth persuaded him to come out on tour after the pair hit it off straightaway. Spieth just felt he was ready and it was not long before he was showing why. When he set out he was ranked 809th in the world. Now he is No 2 behind Rory McIlroy. In 18 months, he has banked more than $13million (\u00a38.86m) on the PGA Tour alone. In his past four events he has won two and finished second twice and when he says: \u2018I don\u2019t see this as a great run of form, I see this as normal,\u2019 it does not come across as at all boastful. Spieth (right) pictured with his college sweetheart girlfriend Annie. Spieth spends time with his family as he poses for a photo with sister Ellie (centre) and brother Steven (right) Asked about McIlroy, as ever, he found exactly the right words: \u2018He\u2019s got four majors and numerous wins and right now that\u2019s something I can only dream about. I\u2019ll never hit it like he does and I have to make up for that somewhere else. But I\u2019m looking forward to getting in the heat of the moment with him in the near future and testing our games.\u2019.

Diana\u2019s final wishes for the disposal of her \u00a321.4 million estate are among a vast archive of wills dating back to 1858 now available to view online. Those of Winston Churchill and George Orwell can also be seen. In her will, Diana\u2019s butler Paul Burrell was bequeathed the sum of \u00a350,000, free of inheritance tax. Scroll down for video . The will of Princess Diana is among 41 million available to order at the click of a button thanks to a new service. Possessions including paintings and a clock were distributed among her 17 godchildren, while the rest went to her sons William and Harry. Qadir Ahmed runs the secure Iron Mountain facility in a leafy suburb of Birmingham where row upon row of the documents are kept in temperature-controlled storage, under tight security. He said the wills are a fascinating snapshot into the personalities and characters of people from every walk of life. For some, having a copy of a will is a matter of sentimentality, whereas others - particularly in the case of celebrities - are ordered out of 'pure curiosity', he said. 'We have 41 million in storage and there are so many fascinating and emotional stories,' said Mr Ahmed. One such is that of the late Paul Hunter, the champion snooker player, who died of cancer in 2006 aged just 27. Paul Burrell was given \u00a350,000 by Diana when she died . The Yorkshireman fathered a daughter who, at the time he penned his will, was not yet born but she is remembered in the passages of his will, as Mr Ahmed describes. 'There are some really touching stories inside these files - people like Paul Hunter, who in his will says 'To my unborn child, I leave ...' and that is genuinely touching. 'He believed at the time he was writing this will, that he wouldn't survive the birth of his child.' 'You feel the emotion of that moment, through reading the record.' . The first disbursement of Diana's will reads: 'I bequeath to my butler Paul Burrell the sum of \u00a350,000, free of inheritance tax.' It also provides for specified keepsakes including watercolour paintings and a carriage clock to be distributed among her 17 godchildren, while to Princes William and Harry she left everything else. In the event of her death she makes express provision the Prince of Wales 'will consult with my mother [Frances Shand Kydd] with regard to the upbringing, education and welfare of our children'. . She also makes clear her wish to be buried. Mr Ahmed said the new system, which has been in place since the end of last year, means people no longer have to order wills by post, or by heading to their local Registry Office. 'A lot of the public are not aware these are public records,' he said. 'Once someone goes through probate, that's it. It's a simple process, through the gov.uk website. 'You can pay a small fee of \u00a310 and order a record of anyone who's gone through probate, searching by the person's name and year of death.' Among the other celebrity wills, are those of wartime prime minister Winston Churchill, creator of Winnie the Pooh AA Milne and George Orwell - under his real name Eric Blair - who penned 1984. Data centre manager Qadir Ahmed inspects one of the more than 41 million public wills held in secure storage at the Iron Mountain facility in Birmingham. Churchill, who died in 1965, left an estate worth \u00a3266,054 which he asked to be divided between his wife and children. He gave his country home Chartwell, in Kent, to the National Trust to be a museum after his death. As well as other bequests of cash to his wife, children, family and friends, he also left money to his employees, including \u00a3100 for his gardener. His son-in-law, Arthur Christopher John Soames, was given 'such of my brood mares, followers and fillies' from Churchill's stable, but with the caveat his choices were \"not exceeding three in number, nor \u00a37,500 in total value'. Also stored away is the will of wartime code-breaker Alan Turing, recently played in Hollywood movie The Imitation Game by Benedict Cumberbatch. Turing's brief final testament directs his possessions be left to close friends and his mother. Meanwhile, Orwell - listed under his birth name Blair - left instructions 'no biography be written' and 'no memorial service be held for me after my death'. .", "hypo": ["The will of Princess Diana is among 41 million available to order at the click of a button.

An own goal by James Collins and Sergio Aguero's 20th Barclays Premier League strike of the season was enough to give City the three points. Here, Sportsmail's Chris Wheeler rates the players' performances at the Etihad Stadium. . MANCHESTER CITY (4-2-3-1) JOE HART 6 - The England goalkeeper couldn\u2019t have wished for a quieter 28th birthday, and was rarely called into action by a toothless West Ham. . PABLO ZABALETA 6.5 \u2013 Treated for bloody nose early on but that was about the extent of the damage inflicted on City. Got forward well as usual. . Manchester City right back Pablo Zabaleta keeps Enner Valencia at bay by putting in a crunching challenge . MARTIN DEMICHELIS 6 \u2013 Careless slip let in Carlton Cole in the first half but otherwise looked relatively comfortable alongside a new defensive partner in Mangala. . ELIAQUIM MANGALA 7 - Dominant display from City\u2019s \u00a332million defender who was able to enjoy a trouble-free return to the line-up, and snuffed out the few threats offered by the Hammers. . ALEKSANDAR KOLAROV 6.5 \u2013 Went close with slightly deflected freekick and another effort from a tight angle in the second half. Defensively, faced little threat from Valencia. . FRANK LAMPARD 6 \u2013 Only his fifth Premier League start for City and of lack match sharpness showed on occasions as his touch let him down. . Manchester City midfielder Frank Lampard was given a rare chance to impress by starting against West Ham. FERNANDO 6.5 \u2013 Didn\u2019t have too much on his plate but was alert to track Kouyate\u2019s burst from midfield in the first half and produced a fantastic interception tackle. . JESUS NAVAS 8 \u2013 Much better from the little Spaniard. More direct and looked for an earlier pass, which contributed to both of City\u2019s first two goals. . Jesus Navas played a major role in Manchester City's two goals at the Etihad Stadium. YAYA TOURE 7 \u2013 A more lively display than of late from the much-maligned Ivorian who passed the ball well and his interception started the move for City\u2019s second goal. . DAVID SILVA 6.5 \u2013 Subdued display despite going close with a couple of efforts, and stretchered off following lengthy treatment after taking an elbow to the head from Kouyate. . SERGIO AGUERO 7.5 \u2013 The Argentine\u2019s third goal in two games took his total to 26 for the season, and the top of the Premier League scoring charts with 20. Can\u2019t argue with that. . Sergio Aguero celebrates with City team-mates Navas and Yaya Toure after putting his side 2-0 up. Manchester City ace Sergio Aguero wheels away in celebration after scoring his 20th Premier League goal. Subs: Caballero, Sagna, Boyata, Fernandinho (for Lampard 88), Nasri (for Silva 75, 6), Dzeko (for Aguero 90+1), Pozo. Scorers: Collins og 18, Aguero 36. Booked: Navas, Silva . WEST HAM (4-1-4-1) ADRIAN 6 \u2013 Had little chance with either of City\u2019s goals, particularly Collins\u2019s own-goal which looped over his head and in off the underside of the bar. . CARL JENKINSON 6 \u2013 One of West Ham\u2019s better defenders and produced an excellent interception to deny Aguero an almost certain goal in the second half. . JAMES COLLINS 5 \u2013 Won\u2019t enjoy seeing a replay of his freakish own-goal. Almost redeemed himself with a great block on Silva \u2013 but not quite. . West Ham centre back James Collins diverted the ball past Adrian to give Manchester City an early lead . WINSTON REID 5.5 \u2013 Did his best to hold City at bay but guilty of an awful dive in the dying stages that was thankfully ignored by the referee and ridiculed by the City fans. AARON CRESSWELL 5.5 \u2013 After his goalscoring exploits against Stoke last weekend, had a difficult afternoon up against Navas and struggled to cope at times. ALEX SONG 5 \u2013 Had his hands full trying to screen West ham\u2019s defence against the blue tide in the first half and replaced by Jarvis as Big Sam tried to salvage something in the second. Alex Song, pictured with Lampard, was replaced by manager Sam Allardyce in the 66th minute . CHEIKHOU KOUYATE 6 \u2013 His arm into Silva\u2019s face was the talking point of a dull game. It seemed to be more careless than malicious but City may think otherwise. MARK NOBLE 5 \u2013 Overrun in midfield and was able to offer his team very little. Struggled tpo get into the game at all. STEWART DOWNING 4.5 \u2013 Lost the ball in the build-up to City\u2019s second goal and that summed up his performance. Below-par and lacked any impact at all.

Stokes had given his wicket away just before the close of the third day when he smashed a Devendra Bishoo long-hop straight to deep square leg and Samuels wasted no time in pouring salt on his wounds, saluting him on his way. The Durham all-rounder muttered under his breath as he walked past Samuels before England closed on 373 for six, a lead of 74, thanks to an outstanding unbeaten 118 from the prolific Joe Root. . Ben Stokes (left) gives Marlon Samuels a stare as the West Indian gives him a send-off salute on Thursday. Stokes looks at Samuels as the cheeky centurion stands at attention with his hat on his check for the send-off. And West Indies great Curtly Ambrose, now the bowling coach, insisted afterwards that the eccentric Samuels was just having a bit of fun. \u2018I didn\u2019t really see it, but there\u2019s nothing wrong with a little banter in international cricket,\u2019 said Ambrose. \u2018As long as it doesn\u2019t go over the top I\u2019m fine with it. I think it\u2019s more friendly. He gave a salute? Is that a sign of respect, I don\u2019t know. 'That's something that we don't really preach. We always make sure that we tell the guys to keep it clean, and keep it within a certain range, and don't go over the top. . 'International cricket is hard, and they must find ways to relax themselves, and smiling is one of those things. As much as we're working hard and want to win, you must have some fun doing it. You've got to enjoy what you are doing. \u2018I\u2019m hoping it was light-hearted because we always make sure we tell the guys to keep it clean and don\u2019t go over the top. I don\u2019t think Marlon meant anything by it. You have to find ways to relax and have fun.\u2019. The gesture was seen as good 'banter' by Geoffrey Boycott in commentary for BBC's Test Match Special. Boycott said: 'The Samuels salute was all right because it is banter and fun. It is not punishable \u2014 it was funny.' . Stokes doesn't get a full piece of an innocuous delivery from Bishoo and skies his shot into the outfield. Stokes looks on in hope as the ball floats into the safe hands of Blackwood, who took his second catch. After the pair clashed in Windies' first innings while Samuels got 103, the all-rounder gave Stokes a slaute. Graeme Swann said immediately after the day's play that while not the biggest fan of Samuels the gesture made him laugh. 'He can be an absolute tool sometimes but I have to admit Marlon Samuels just made me laugh tea out of my nose with his saluting send off,' Swann wrote on Twitter. 'Heavy money on @benstokes38 getting Marlon out in the 2nd dig. Eng should line up a guard of honour for him. Love to see humour on the field.'

Robinson\u2019s team needed a freakish goal by Dean Bowditch, 25 minutes from time, to break Doncaster\u2019s resistance and stay within a point of the automatic promotion places with two games to play. Substitute Bowditch had only been on for a few seconds when a clearance by defender Mitchell Lund hit him on the head and looped into the net. . MK Dons midfielder Carl Baker celebrates scoring the second goal. League One player of the year Dele Alli of MK Dons goes past them. MK Dons winger Samir Carruthers goes on the attack during his side's 3-0 win over Doncaster. \u2018It\u2019s our first time this season we\u2019ve had a fluke goal, it\u2019s overdue,\u2019 said Robinson after Carl Baker, another substitute, had secured the win with two fine goals. \u2018We never lost patience. We showed great maturity and quality and that\u2019s 12 goals in out last three games. \u2018To be on 85 points is sensational. If we win one more and get to 88 that will be a magnificent season. If we win them both and get 91 that\u2019s unbelievable. If it\u2019s not good enough to finish second we\u2019ll go into the play-offs as the form team.\u2019 . Meanwhile, Preston remain in pole position to join champions Bristol City in the Championship next season as they stay a point ahead of the Dons after a 3-1 win at Notts County, who are staring relegation in the face. First-half goals from Jermaine Beckford and Joe Garner set up the success, before James Spencer got the Magpies back in it. But Beckford's second sealed it in the final 10 minutes to leave County two points adrift of safety with two games left. . Swindon look destined for the play-offs after only managing a 3-3 draw with Walsall. The Robins will have to win their remaining three games and hope that Preston and the Dons lose their last two to have any chance of gatecrashing the top two. Jermaine Beckford scored a brace for Preston to help his side defeat Notts County 3-1 on Tuesday. Joe Garner (right) netted a first-half goal to double Preston's lead and set them on their way to a perfect win. Goals from Kieron Morris and Jordy Hiwula put the Saddlers two to the good only for two quickfire penalties from Ben Gladwin to bring Swindon level. Romaine Sawyers' effort 16 minutes from time looked to be decisive but Jordan Turnbull levelled late on for the Robins. Rochdale kept their faint play-off hopes alive with a 1-0 win over Leyton Orient, which leaves the O's in dire straits at the other end of the table. Ian Henderson's 66th-minute goal won it for Dale who are five points adrift of the top six with two games to play and need Chesterfield or Sheffield United to drop points to get in the play-offs. Orient, who were beaten play-off finalists last season, are two points adrift of safety. Elsewhere, Scunthorpe virtually guaranteed their third-tier status after a 1-1 draw at home to Bradford.

Redfearn, the club's third coach of the season, took training before attending a delayed press conference and said: 'It\u2019s become difficult for me. It\u2019s not ideal timing. It\u2019s not helped. I\u2019ve got to have a good think about my future now. It undermines everything. We have put things together me and Steve. Before it was a no brainer for me to stay on, not so much now. 'I love this club, I was brought up on Leeds United but this situation is a difficult one for me. 'Thommo was informed this morning through a letter. He\u2019s been suspended - for what, I don\u2019t know. You\u2019d have to find that out from the club. I don\u2019t understand why he has been suspended. I\u2019m bitterly disappointed. It\u2019s a difficult one for me to take, I can\u2019t think for one minute why someone who has been part of this success has been sacked. 'Me and Steve were the ideal partnership, he\u2019s been great for me and I\u2019m bitterly disappointed that he\u2019s not here.' Redfearn\u2019s contract is also up at the end of the season and club president Massimo Cellino is suspended until May 3. . Sol Bamba heads home in a recent win for the Whites at Fulham's Craven Cottage. Leeds sit 13th in the Championship table but were unbeaten in March and take on Blackburn Rovers on Saturday. It is also understood that Redfearn is under pressure not to select top scorer Mirco Antenucci who will trigger a bonus clause in his contract should he score two more goals. Thompson is taking advice from the LMA while Salerno's own position is thought to be open to review at the end of the season. .", "hypo": ["Steve Thompson has been suspended by Leeds United.

Nina Anderson searched pawn shops near her house in Portsmouth, Hampshire, after gold and silver necklaces worth nearly \u00a3400 were taken from her bedroom as she watched television. The great-grandmother, who lives with husband Maurice, 75, eventually spotted two of the stolen items in the window of a Cash and Cheque Express in the city centre two months after the raid. Her actions, which echo those of Agatha Christie character Miss Marple, led to the arrest of burglar Martin Campbell, who has now been jailed for three years. Detective: Nina Anderson, pictured with husband Maurice, 75, searched pawn shops near their house in Portsmouth, Hampshire, after gold and silver necklaces were taken from her bedroom as she watched TV. Real-life Miss Marple: Mrs Anderson's (left with her husband) actions mirror those of Agatha Christie character Miss Marple, who was played on ITV by actress Geraldine McEwan (right) between 2004 and 2007. Portsmouth Crown Court heard Campbell, who had been hired to do odd jobs for the couple, forced his way into the house when Mrs Anderson was at home alone on December 28. He was arrested by police when Mrs Anderson noticed necklaces missing from her jewellery box, but was later released with no further action. Determined to retrieve her stolen jewellery, Mrs Anderson began looking in nearby pawn shops. . She spotted two of the missing necklaces in the window of a branch of Cash and Cheque Express on February 19. The pawn shop was able to provide a bank statement, photo ID and ownership declaration that Campbell, 28, had provided when he sold the jewellery. Mrs Anderson contacted the police, who used the records to re-arrest Campbell. . Mrs Anderson's actions mirror those of Miss Marple, a fictional character who appears in 12 of Agatha Christie's novels, solving difficult crimes with her shrewd intelligence. . Breaking in: Campbell forced his way into the house when Mrs Anderson was at home alone. Above, the damage done to the door during the raid. She said: 'I left copies of the stolen gold in pawn shops around the city. . 'I found myself looking in the windows every time I passed by. Then this time something caught my eye - it was my silver necklace. 'It took my work to do it, otherwise we wouldn't have heard anything.' . Prosecutor Martyn Booth told Portsmouth Crown Court: 'The police had effectively concluded their investigations. Thankfully the Andersons had conducted their own enquiries. . 'Enquiries established that the defendant had turned up on December 30 two days after the burglary trying to sell the items.' . An 18ct gold necklace with an image of St Anthony that Mrs Anderson's late father gave to her when she left Italy in 1957 is still missing. Mrs Anderson said she had treated Campbell like 'one of the family' when she hired him as a handyman and that the burglary was a 'great betrayal'. She said: 'We can't trust anybody, I'm locking myself in. I've been through quite a lot, I've been traumatised. I've had to go to the doctors to get sleeping tablets.' . Barry McElduff, defending, handed a letter to the judge written by Campbell apologising to the Andersons. Mr McElduff said: 'He accepts full responsibility for he offences. He expresses remorse and shame. Temptation got the better of him.' The father-of-one has had 24 court appearances for 40 offences, including previous burglaries in 2002, 2003 and 2006. He admitted burglary and fraud relating to pawning the jewellery. . He was sentenced to 18 weeks in prison in addition to a suspended sentence for stealing a bicycle that he was serving when he committed the crime. .

The pawn shop was able to provide records that traced back to Campbell. Sentencing Campbell to three years, Judge Sarah Munro QC said: 'You describe them as people with hearts of gold. 'You threw their kindness back in their faces as you did their trust in you by breaking into their home and stealing jewellery. These offences, as I hope you understand, were a great betrayal. 'They've led to a considerable detrimental effect on that couple.' The officer investigating the burglary has praised the Andersons for their detective work. He said: 'It was her integrity which led to the recovery of two items. We always encourage victims of crime to check out the normal joints, second hand shops, pawn shops.' .

Attorney-turned-cook and activist Joan Cheever has spent the past decade feeding the homeless from the back of her charity food truck, until earlier this month she was slapped with a $2,000 fine for her charitable efforts. Cheever founded The Chow Train non-profit organization in 2005, preparing hot meals in her licensed mobile kitchen and serving them at city parks out of her personal pickup, which she has been using as a delivery truck because it is more maneuverable. Punished for compassion: On April 7, San Antonio police officers issued a fine to local chef and activist Joan Cheever (right) for feeding the homeless at Maverick Park. Wrong truck: Cheever, the founder of The Chow Train non-profit food truck, was serving hot meals out of her personal pickup truck because it is more compact . No permit: Cheever's mobile kitchen is commercially licensed, but her personal vehicle is not. Hefty sum: Mrs Cheever was issued a citation and a $2,000 fine for failure to serve food out of a licensed food truck. Mixed messages: After writing out the citation, the officers allowed Cheever and her volunteers to continue distributing the meals . On April 7, Cheever and her band of volunteers were dishing out free food to those in need at Maverick Park on the outskirts of San Antonio when she was approached by four police officers on bicycles. Speaking to ABC News, Cheever said she asked the cops, \u2018What's the problem?' and they replied, 'You.' After a brief exchange with the SAPD cops, Mrs Cheever was issued a citation and a $2,000 fine for failure to serve food out of a licensed food truck. After writing out the ticket, Cheever said the officers gave her the green light to continue distributing meals. . San Antonio city officials stated that Cheever was cited for \u2018failing to adhere to long-standing regulations that are in place to ensure public health and safety.\u2019. City spokeswoman Di Galvan told ABC that mobile food establishment permits are not transferable from one vehicle to another. But the hefty fine has done nothing to deter the plucky Good Samaritan from carrying out her mission to provide much-needed sustenance to the city's poor. Her meals usually consist of a vegetable soup, a main course, such as meatball or coq au vin, and a dessert. Since her April 7 run-in with the law, the chef has offered meals on two separate occasions at the park, each time drawing larger than usual crowds of supporters. No letter of apology: Cheever received this official letter from the city summoning her to court June 23 . Cooking up kindness: Cheever is an attorney and a trained chef who started her Chow Train charity in 2005 . Good Samaritans: Cheever and her band of volunteers have served hundreds of thousands of hot meals to those in need in San Antonio and other areas. \u2018I came back to the park the following Tuesday and was met with 100 people who had candles and signs,\u2019 Cheever said. \u2018This isn\u2019t only about The Chow Train. It\u2019s about every non-profit and every person who wants to do a good thing, but are intimidated by the $2,000 fine and possible arrest. So we\u2019re just going to keep rolling on.\u2019. Cheever has retained the services of a lawyer to fight the citation. 'I\u2019m not going to settle and I\u2019m not going to pay the fine and I\u2019m not going to stop,' a defiant Mrs Cheever declared. \u2018They can come out every Tuesday and write me up a ticket and we\u2019ll just start collecting them.\u2019. Joan Cheever, a wife and mother, had graduated from a culinary school and was featured on celebrity cook Rachel Ray's daytime talk show. Besides offering gourmet meals to low-income residents of San Antonio, Cheever and her group of helpers also have delivered meals to victims of natural disasters in places like Joplin, Missouri, and Moore, Oklahoma, which were ravaged by tornadoes recently. Cheever said it was insulting to her as a licensed cook that the city of San Antonio was treating her as a danger to the community. Religious freedom: Cheever accused police and city officials of violating her freedom of religion because she considers cooking and feeding the poor a free exercise of her faith. Defiant: Cheever pans to fight the citation and even possibly sue the city for violating the 1999 Texas Religious Freedom Restoration Act. The Chow Train founder is scheduled to go before a judge June 23. Cheever said she is prepared to invoke the 1999 Texas Religious Freedom Restoration Act, saying she has the right to feed the homeless because she considers it a free exercise of her faith. Cheever said as much to Officer Mike Marotta as he was writing out the ticket to her April 7. \u2018One of the police officers said, \u201cMa\u2019am, if you want to pray, go to church,\u201d and I said, \u201cThis is how I pray. When I cook this food and deliver it to the people who are less fortunate,\u2019 Cheever told News 4 San Antonio. Cheever is now considering suing the city for infringing upon her freedom of religion. The San Antonio City Council\u2019s Quality of Life committee held a meeting Tuesday to address the controversy surrounding Cheever's citation, saying that their goal is to protect the homeless from unsafe food, reported San Antonio Express News. But Cheever argued that she been distributing food in plain sight week after week for years, and local officers would pass by and wave at her. Some of them, according to the chef, even accepted meals from her. Besides offering gourmet meals to low-income residents of San Antonio, Cheever and her group of helpers also have delivered meals to victims of natural disasters in places like Joplin, Missouri, and Moore, Oklahoma, which were ravaged by tornadoes recently. Rep, Joaquin Castro, a Democrat representing San Antonio, has weighed in on the hot-button issue, calling on the City Council to \u2018do right by Joan Cheever\u2019 and \u2018allow her to feed the homeless.\u2019.

A Ukip candidate accused of bribing voters with sausage rolls will face no further action - but he could be arrested if he tries it again.

Although he was never arrested or charged, Mr Rose was questioned by police over an alleged criminal offence of 'treating'. .

Mr Rose, a jeweller, was questioned at Romsey Police station, Hampshire. He poked fun at the accusations by taking in boxes of Jaffa Cakes for the officers. It came after he laughed off the initial allegations by saying: 'Thank God they didn't find out about the Jaffa Cakes.' However, when he emerged 30 minutes later, he revealed that officers had refused to accept the treats, saying that would also constitute a bribe. .

The Prime Minister will vow to encourage more job creation by extending national insurance breaks, worth at least \u00a32,000 a year to smaller firms taking on new staff, for a further five years. Saying he is 'really angry' at Labour's claim that the Conservatives are 'the party for the few, not the many', Mr Cameron will hail the 'jobs miracle' that has seen 1,000 new jobs created every day. . David Cameron will today claim that Labour's economic policies risk putting a million people out of work. Contrasting that with Labour's record, he will claim Ed Miliband's economic policies could see 'a million more people joining the dole queues'. Last night, in a boost for George Osborne, the head of the International Monetary Fund picked out the UK recovery as exemplary. Christine Lagarde said the world was suffering from a 'moderate and uneven' return to growth which was 'simply not good enough'. But, in an endorsement of the Government's economic record, she cited the United States and the United Kingdom as countries where the outlook is positive. The comments completed an extraordinary volte-face by the IMF on the Coalition's handling of the economy. Just two years ago, it warned that Mr Osborne was 'playing with fire' by pressing ahead with austerity \u2013 only to see the economic recovery take off. Britain was the best performing major economy in the developed world last year, with growth of 2.8 per cent. Figures published by the fund also show it has overtaken socialist-run France to become the second most powerful economy in Europe behind Germany. However, the IMF predicted Britain would still be running a deficit at the end of the decade \u2013 despite Tory efforts to balance the books. Cameron will say if Ed Miliband repeated the economic mistakes of last Labour government there will be a risk to jobs. Mr Cameron, who dismissed the projections, will today launch a Conservative 'jobs manifesto' setting out plans to bring about 'full employment' \u2013 meaning everyone who wants a job has one. 'We are living through a jobs miracle \u2013 brought to you by a Conservative government that has backed business, reformed welfare and rewarded work,' he will say. Claiming Mr Miliband represents a threat to jobs, he will add: 'You know what makes me really angry? It's when our opponents still go on about 'you Tories \u2013 the party for the few and not the many\u2026' Excuse me? 'This is the party that's taken three million of the lowest-paid workers out of income tax altogether; that's cut the taxes of 26million working people; that's seen 1,000 jobs created every day \u2013 jobs that are giving families security, putting food on tables, helping people out of poverty. 'Under the last five years of Labour, unemployment went up by 600 people a day. 'So if Ed Miliband repeated the economic mistakes of the last Labour government \u2013 that he was a part of \u2013 he risks a million more people joining the dole queues.' The jobs manifesto will include a guarantee to maintain the so-called 'employment allowance' until 2020, meaning a third of employers will continue to pay no jobs tax for another five years. The tax break, which helps smaller businesses take on new workers by freeing businesses from at least the first \u00a32,000 of employers' national insurance, has already been taken up by 856,000 firms. David Cameron pictured on a metal platform yesterday (left) and John Major on his soap box in 1992 (right) One of the most abiding images from the 1992 General Election campaign was the moment John Major got on his soap box.

STARTING GUN: The former first lady faces no substantial competition \u2013 yet \u2013 for the Democratic nomination in 2016. In a timely release just days before the start of her presidential campaign, Clinton reveals in a new epilogue to her book 'Hard Choices' why she decided to take the presidential leap. 'Becoming a grandmother has made me think deeply about the responsibility we all share as stewards of the world we inherit and will one day pass on. Rather than make me want to slow down, it has spurred me to speed up. . 'As Margaret Mead said, children keep our imaginations fresh and our hearts young, and they drive us to work for a better future. I've also returned again and again to this question of universality \u2013 how much we all have in common even if the circumstances of our lives may be different. 'As you've seen throughout this book, one of the defining themes of my time as Secretary of State was our increasing global interdependence. Despite all the division and discord in the world, which sometimes can seem overwhelming, the basic fact of the 21st century is that we're more connected than ever. . 'If the United States continues to lead the world in the years ahead, as I believe it can and must, it will be because we have learned how to define the terms of our interdependence to promote more cooperation and shared prosperity and less conflict and inequality. 'As we've seen since the first edition of this book was published in June 2014, the negative side of interdependence remains potent \u2013 whether it was the spread of virulent new strands of extremism in the Middle East or old-style nationalism in Europe or a deadly epidemic in Africa. Our job is to build up the positive side. 'The United States and the other great democracies have to redouble our efforts to empower moderates and marginalize extremists everywhere, and to stand firmly and united in pursuit of a more just, free, and peaceful world. . 'That's the world I want for Charlotte and for all our kids.' In the excerpt, released Friday to the Huffington Post, she describes how becoming a grandmother inspired her 'to see the world in new ways' and made her realize that 'there was so much more to do.' 'Becoming a grandmother has made me think deeply about the responsibility we all share as stewards of the world we inherit and will one day pass on,' she writes. 'Rather than make me want to slow down, it has spurred me to speed up.' The maneuver of re-upping public attention on her poorly selling memoir, though, highlights one of Clinton's key liabilities: likeability. Her campaign has a steep hill to climb if she is to escape the 1990s-era image of a controlling and often temperamental politician, or the 2000s sequel \u2013 a scheming conniver bent on winning power. The Republican National Committee had been mum about Hillary's impending announcement, but the party took its gloves off Friday morning with a scathing video ad highlighting her scandals. 'From the East Wing to the State Department, Hillary Clinton has left a trail of secrecy, scandal and failed liberal policies that no image consultant can erase, RNC Chairman Reince Priebus said Friday in a statement. . 'Voters want to elect someone they can trust and Hillary's record proves that she cannot be trusted.' . The Clinton campaign-in-waiting held a secret off-the-record dinner with a hand-picked group of journalists Thursday night in Washington, D.C., also according to the Huffington Post. . The former first lady once faced no substantial competition for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination but a few challengers have emerged lately \u2013 most notably former Maryland governor Martin O'Malley, who has also conducting private fundraisers meetings in New York City. Clinton also faces intense scrutiny over an email scandal involving a private home-brew server she maintained at her Chappaqua, New York home, a problem that will taint her claim to her party's top perch. Announcing a presidential campaign on social media has become ordinary this year, with Republicans Rand Paul and Ted Cruz preempting their own televised launches with Tweets and Facebook posts meant to appeal to young and low-attention-span voters. Clinton, too, will need to leverage the online space and will follow her tweets with email and video announcements. The Reuters news service predicted that the videos will go 'viral.' In her previous presidential run in 2008, Clinton lost to Barack Obama, in part because of the Obama campaign's intense use of digital and online strategies to draw attention to his candidacy and raise huge sums through small donations. By 2012 his team, led by veterans from Facebook and Google, were deploying sophisticated social media strategies. . Clinton's 2016 campaign is expected to concentrate on making the 67-year-old former first lady relatable to ordinary Americans despite her age and longstanding connection to the Democratic Party's political machinery. After serving eight years as first lady, she won a U.S. Senate seat in New York and then spent four years jetting to foreign capitals as Obama's first-term secretary of state.

Officers from Scotland Yard's Flying Squad released images of three suspects on Saturday, but refused to release a picture of the supposed ringleader, likely because he has already been identified. Meanwhile criminologist Richard Hoskins said he has identified 'startling similarities' between the Hatton Garden raid and novel Black Echo, by Michael Connelly. Scroll down for video . Police are believed to have identified one of the Hatton Garden raiders after releasing CCTV images of the gang as they raided the bank vault over the Easter bank holiday. Officers released images of three of the men, but refused to release an images of the supposed ringleader, which is believed to be because he has already been identified. The novel was based on real-life bank robbers dubbed 'The Hole In The Ground Gang' who struck three vaults in LA in 1986 and 1987, and were never caught. In the 1986 robbery, the gang tunneled into a bank vault over a long weekend, triggering alarms on the Friday that were not investigated, before raiding safety deposit boxes stored inside the vaults. It was not until the week following the raids that police were called and discovered the robbers had dug into the vault using heavy machinery, in very similar circumstances to the Hatton Garden raid. Criminologist Richard Hoskins noticed 'striking similarities' between the Hatton Garden raid and crime novel Black Echo, which itself is based on two jewel heists in LA in the 1980s. Mr Hoskins, who also wrote murder novel The Boy in the River, told MailOnline: 'There is obviously a lot we don't know about the Hatton Garden heist, but on the surface they look very similar. 'I think that when the raiders were planning their heist they must have read this book, or researched the robberies in LA. 'While the robbery is obviously terrible for the victims, I think everyone can agree that this was a very smart operation, and Black Echo sets out a very smart way to rob a vault. 'The timeline fits almost exactly, right down to the alarm being set off on a Friday and the break in being discovered on a Tuesday.' The Hole In The Ground Gang first struck in 1986, when they tunneled underneath a First Interstate Bank located along famous Sunset Boulevard near Hollywood, in LA. The gang, believed to number around four or five, made a hole in the wall of a storm drain underneath LA's streets, before tunneling 100ft through the dirt, emerging underneath the bank vault. . They then used concrete drills and saws to cut a 20ft-by-25ft hole in the floor of the vault, before clambering through and ransacking the safety deposit boxes. In total they got away with $270,000 in cash, along with the contents of 36 deposit boxes, worth up to $2.5million. One box contained a sketch of a young girl by Henri Matisse. The crew had stashed quadbikes underground for a quick escape, but the raid was in fact not discovered until the start of the following week when staff arrived to find the vault ransacked. Police then discovered the tunnel, littered with 'an enormous number' of polystyrene coffee cups, and surmised that the raiders were probably sewer or construction workers who had decided to turn their skills to a sinister new use. Nobody was ever traced for the crime, and in 1987 the same group struck again, this time at a Bank of America in another LA neighbourhood. In both Hatton Garden and the LA raids, the gangs bored into vaults using heavy drills (pictured), broke in over a long weekend, set off an alarm on the Friday that wasn't checked out, and raided safety deposit boxes. The LA raiders became known as the Hole In The Ground Gang, and Mr Hoskins believes the group who raided Hatton Garden (picutred) must have known about them, or read the book inspired by them. Again, the group had used heavy tools to cut their way into a bank vault over the course of a weekend, and again they had set off an alarm on their way in. However, on this occasion police did respond, and they were forced to flee with just $89,000 and without cracking a single safety deposit box. It was only afterwards the officers discovered another tunnel underneath Union Federal Savings and Loan in Beverly Hills, suggesting the gang were attempting to hit two vaults at once. Mr Connelly told The Times: 'The Black Echo was a fictionalised account of a bank heist that occurred in LA in September 1987. It was never solved.' In the Hatton Garden raid, the Met Police have said the raiders broke into the building on the second floor, disabling the lift before lowering themselves down the shaft and breaking into the basement. The men then climbed back up to the ground floor to let other gang members in through a side entrance, before all making their way to the vaults where they drilled their way inside. The raiders then broke into 72 safety deposit boxes, before making their getaway in a white Ford Transit van parked outside. . The diamond-tipped drills were taken from a building site in Fetter Lane, an eight minute walk from Hatton Garden, and nobody was ever arrested. Police are probing the thefts of several drills in the months before the raid, including two Hilti drills that were taken near Hatton Garden. DCI Paul Johnson (pictured) has previously said Hilti drills were used in the raid. City of London Police also confirmed today that they have passed information to Scotland Yard about the theft of two Hilti drills, the same devices used in the Hatton Garden raid, in December last year. . In another development, The Sun has revealed that \u00a380,000 worth of diamond tipped drills were stolen from another site in South London in November, using a van similar to that at Hatton Garden.

Yet access to GPs has become a major policy and political issue. The crisis in A&E has led some to blame a lack of available GP appointments for people heading to emergency departments instead. . Weekend opening hours for GPs has been touted as one solution - by improving access, many patients won\u2019t need to take up other care services. The crisis in A&E has led some people to blame a lack of available GP appointments, prompting more people to visit the emergency department instead . Since the summer of 2013, a number of GP surgeries in London have been piloting seven-day opening, as part of the Challenge Fund initiative - funding for which was recently increased from \u00a350 million to \u00a3100 million. . Through the Challenge Fund, GP surgeries were asked to bid for funds for extra opening hours, but this was solely for set-up costs, for example, the sharing of medical records. Running costs had to be covered by surgeries from existing budgets. We wanted to know whether the flow of patients to A&E from four of these pilots in central London changed compared to a control group of 30 other surgeries in central London. In our study, we found an eight per cent drop in A&E attendances among patients of the pilot surgeries compared to the control group. We also found an eight per cent drop in A&E admissions among elderly patients, those aged 65 or more, of the pilot surgeries. . This is because cautious doctors in emergency departments are more likely to admit elderly patients to hospital, while GPs, familiar with their case histories, may be more comfortable treating and sending them back home. The effect was also largest at weekends. . And the fall was only in cases of mild to moderate severity. . There was no effect in the most urgent cases such as those caused by accidents or brought to A&E in ambulance. Weekend opening hours for GPs has been touted as one solution to relieve the mounting pressure on A&E departments - by improving access, it is thought many patients won\u2019t need to take up other care services. Based on these findings, we calculated that this eight per cent fall would translate into two million fewer visits to A&E each year if weekend opening was made available nationally. . Given that the average cost of a GP consultation is about \u00a327, while that of an A&E visit is \u00a3114, two million fewer A&E visits would imply a cost saving of \u00a3194 million for the NHS. From research carried out by Thomas Cowling and colleagues, we know that there is an association between GP access and the number of non-urgent A&E visits. . In 2010-11, the GP surgeries that were most accessible also had lower A&E non-urgent visits compared to the GP surgeries with the least access. . A one point increase in the percentage of registered patients who seek GP appointments within two week days increases non-urgent visits by 0.7 per cent. Increased travel time to hospital also reduces non-urgent A&E visits. Out-of-hour services and walk-in centres, of course are already available. The last Labour government encouraged extra hours but the policy was eventually dropped. On the whole, most of us are happy with access to our GP. . In a survey of GP patients conducted in 2014, three-quarters of respondents said that they found opening hours convenient. . But among those who found GP opening hours inconvenient, 74 per cent wanted surgeries to be open on Saturdays, 71 per cent late hours (after 6.30pm) and 37 per cent wanted them open on Sundays. . Around 24 per cent of people said it was not easy to get through to their surgery on the phone. One issue is also about the demographic of service users. . The crisis has become a key political issue. David Cameron has promised to introduce seven-day access to GP services by 202, while Ed Miliband has vowed to introduce a 48-hour target for GP appointments. As one GP put it: 'Longer opening is a fine idea but the problem is that the people who see us the most - young children and elderly - are the ones that don\u2019t have a problem with appointments on a Monday afternoon. Labour has promised a 48-hour target for GP appointments (at a cost of \u00a3100 million), while the Tories have promised a seven-day access to GP services by 2020. . David Cameron said that the move could take pressure off A&E wards which are 'not the right place for frail, elderly people'. Seven-day opening, however, does not actually mean all surgeries are open all week. . In many places, weekend or late opening is rotated between nearby surgeries. . It\u2019s a practical and cheap solution, especially for small surgeries which have less resources to spend, fewer GP and nursing staff, so less flexibility in adding weekend shifts. . Further evaluation of other pilots may point us towards the most cost-effective arrangement for weekend openings. .", "hypo": ["GPs are the gateway to NHS care - nine out of 10 times.", "The crisis in A&E has led some to blame a lack of GP appointments.

It will be the first in-depth interview that Kyle has given since former Marine Eddie Ray Routh was found guilty of capital murder on February 24 for shooting dead Chris Kyle and his friend, Chad Littlefield. He was automatically handed a life sentence without the possibility of parole and Taya Kyle broke down in tears on the stand when she gave evidence on the first day of the trial. During the course of their interview, Kyle jokes with Roberts that she never thought she would marry 'a cowboy' but was 'excited' by falling in love with him. 'I never probably thought a cowboy would want me,' she said. 'And I said I would never marry somebody -- a SEAL either. So\u2026 'there you go with your plans again,' right?'

Eddie Ray Routh pleaded not guilty to killing Chris Kyle and said that he shot him and his friend Chad Littlefield dead because he was suffering PTSD. The jury decided he was guilty of murder and knew what he was doing. Taya has also written a new book, 'American Wife: A Memoir of Love, War, Faith and Renewal' which will go into detail about her marriage and the aftermath of Chris's death. The book is released on May 4 and Taya hopes it will draw a line under her recent events. In March, Taya published a heartbreaking letter to mark their 13th wedding anniversary. Taya Kyle pledged to love her late husband 'all the days of my life' in the touching tribute in which she described the moment her future husband gave her two dozen roses during one of their first dates. Kyle, who was the subject of last year's Clint Eastwood-directed movie American Sniper, was gunned down by fellow war veteran Eddie Ray Routh at a shooting range in Rough Creek, Texas, on February 2, 2013. Taya Kyle was the first witnesses called during the trial. The judge also allowed her to attend the public gallery afterwards to watch the trial. American Sniper: Eddie Ray Routh shot Chris Kyle dead in February of 2013. In February of 2015 he was found guilty for the death of the war hero. That day, Kyle had offered to help Routh deal with his post traumatic stress disorder but was instead shot dead along with his friend Chad Littlefield. Now, in the wake of a turbulent year that involved her husband's killer's trial and an appearance at the Academy Awards for the film made in his name, Mrs Kyle has written of her enduring love for her husband. Posted on Facebook in March, her letter said: 'I feel you in my heart and soul so strongly. I am more blessed to have been your wife than anything else in my life. 'Today, I am thinking of our new relationship, when you rented a boutique hotel room in San Diego and surprised me with two dozen long stem pink roses when we arrived. You got us tickets to a local improv type play. I knew then I was the luckiest girl in the world to be with tough, romantic, loving you. 'Today, I have a choice. I can bury myself under the covers and acknowledge the pain of missing you and mourn the future anniversaries without you. Or, I can celebrate never having a day without you in my heart because you loved me enough to leave me a lifetime of memories and beauty. 'I am somewhere in between today. I loved you yesterday, I love you know, and I will love you all the days of my life.'

Mr Filiba said on Sunday that the planes could not come soon enough. 'There are cracks all over the building,' he said. 'I'm not sleeping because of the baby - which is a good reason - but I'm also not sleeping because of worries about the building collapsing.'

Evaluating the greatest ever fights is a complex variable of several factors including not only the quality and excitement of the action but the political, social and cultural undertones, the scale of expectation and outside influences. Where Money Man vs PacMan comes to rank among the most important fights in ring history will depend upon what happens that coming night in the MGM Grand Garden Arena. Here is the second of my 12 most significant fights in boxing\u2019s history. THE FIGHT AGAINST THE NAZIS. Yankee Stadium, New York. June 22, 1938. Joe Louis vs Max Schmeling. Joe Louis (left) knocks out Max Schmeling in the first round to win the heavyweight title on June 22, 1938. Although Herr Hitler was trumpeting Max Schmeling as a hero of the Third Reich following his knock-out victory over Joe Louis two years earlier, the German was anti-Nazi and remained so during World War II which was imminent at the time of the re-match. Louis had come back from that shock to win the world heavyweight title by defeating James J Braddock but announced he would not consider himself the true champion until he avenged the loss to Schmeling. The fight was billed as a political war between an America struggling to emerge from the Great Depression and a Germany provoking armed conflict in Europe by annexing Austria. Yet such was Schmeling\u2019s distaste for being exploited by Adolf Hitler\u2019s propaganda machine \u2013 and his loyal refusal to sack his Jewish manager \u2013 that his wife and mother were refused permission to travel to New York to support him in case he defected to the U.S. The social picture was clouded further by black America\u2019s belief in Louis as a high-profile campaigner for Civil Rights. Louis is carried by his supporters ahead of his 1938 re-match with Schmeling. A poster for the rematch (left) while Louis and Schmeling shake hands at the weigh-in ahead of their fight. Jack Johnson vs James Jeffries . Louis, who had complacently trained on the links rather in the gym for the first fight, gave up golf and women in serious preparation for the return bout. President Franklin D Roosevelt invited Louis to the White House and told him: 'Joe, we need muscles like yours to beat the Germans.\u2019. Louis would say: \u2018The whole damned country was depending on me.\u2019. Clark Gable, Gary Cooper and Gregory Peck were among Hollywood celebrities in the 70,000 crowd, along with FBI boss J Edgar Hoover. Louis is pictured jumping aside as Schmeling falls after the knock-out. Louis had been tactically out-thought in their first fight so decided to go for broke from the first bell. A barrage of left hooks followed by a right to the body had Schmeling doubled-up in pain and referee Arthur Donovan gave him a standing eight count. Louis switched his attack to the head, dropping Schmeling twice, and Donovan called a halt only two minutes and 40 seconds into the fight. Louis, the Brown Bomber, had fractured Schmeling\u2019s spine with his body attacks. As the man from Brandenburg was taken to hospital the ambulance passed through Harlem and he recalled later: \u2018I could the noise of crowds dancing. Bands had left the bars and were playing on the sidewalks. Everywhere was filled with celebrations and saxophones.\u2019. Louis goes on the attack against Schmeling as he gains revenge after defeat two years earlier. Schmeling would be forcibly conscripted as a German paratrooper war but served only briefly and his resistance to Hitler made him a hero in his country for a second time, after the war. He invested in successful businesses and lived until shortly before his 100th birthday, in 2005. Louis lost his money and became a greeter at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas. His old friend Schmeling visited him there once every year until his death in 1981, when he acted as a pall-bearer at Louis\u2019 funeral. .", "hypo": ["Floyd Mayweather vs Manny Pacquiao will be the biggest fight of all time.

Richard and Angela Maxwell, from Coningsby in Lincolnshire, became 10th on the National Lottery rich list after they scooped \u00a353,193,914 on the draw on Tuesday. The couple, both 67, so far have only modest plans for what to do with the huge windfall - with Mr Maxwell planning to retire and play bowls. . Scroll down for video . Richard and Angela Maxwell from Lincolnshire have become the 10th biggest British winners of Euromillions. Mrs Maxwell said she thought her husband was playing an April Fools' Day joke on her when he told her. The semi-retired consultant in the poultry industry said: 'I always keep our lottery tickets in the kitchen drawer so I took a break and went online to check the results. 'I looked first at the two Lucky Stars and noticed we had those. Then I scanned across to the first main number and immediately knew they all matched our numbers. I checked again and again, five times in total, as I couldn't believe it.' Mr Maxwell said he was in shock when he saw only one ticket had won \u00a353million and believed someone had scanned his ticket and put it on the website as a joke. 'It was April Fool's Day after all,' he added. The father-of-two kept the win to himself for four more hours until wife Angela got home from helping to cook for a local OAP luncheon club. He said: 'I knew Angela would be busy and wouldn't answer her mobile phone so I waited til she got home. 'I kept myself busy making cups of tea for the builders because I couldn't sit still but didn't say anything to anyone.' When his wife came back carrying a basket of tea towels and asking about dinner plans, Mr Maxwell said: 'Angela, I've got something to tell you.' The shocked couple plan to take their family on holiday to New Zealand first class and buy a Land Rover. His wife said: 'I didn't know what to think. Richard just went red in the face and then said \"we've won \u00a353 million\". 'I just said \"don't be stupid\" - he's always playing jokes so I thought it was an April's Fool. 'I just didn't believe it, then he showed me the numbers on the website and I dropped the basket of tea towels on the floor. I then just sat down in the chair for about half-an-hour stunned.' . When the couple called their two daughters, Sharon, 45, and Paula, 44, they too thought it was an April Fool's joke. . The couple are still thinking about what to do with the huge windfall but have already decided to upgrade a planned holiday to New Zealand - by taking the whole family first-class. They said they are also keen to help good causes and will donate some of the cash to their local community. Sports fan Mr Maxwell said he will now be able to retire completely to enjoy following Boston United and big sporting events, and play golf and bowls. Mr Maxwell is also going to treat himself to a Land Rover, while his wife plans to splash out on designer handbags and shoes. Mrs Maxwell said: 'Richard says he wants to travel round the world watching sport. I can go with him but I don't think I'll be watching any sport. It'll be retail therapy for me. 'As soon as we told the girls it started to dawn on us just how big an amount of money it is. 'It still hasn't sunk in. We don't know if we will make anyone millionaires but we will make sure our family is OK.' . Mr Maxwell added: 'It's a life-changing amount of money - \u00a31 million would have been amazing but \u00a353 million enables you to do so much, not just for you, but those around you. 'Our local community is really important to us, in particular helping young people in the area. The win will enable us to spend more time getting involved, as well as give financial support.' Mr Maxwell said he survived prostate cancer eight years ago and is now in remission. He said: 'I had three operations and it was successful in the end. I was very ill for quite a while. That's why I retired from full-time work. He added: 'It made me realise that every day is a gift. We are not materialistic people. We don't crave things. 'We are simple people. Winning this amount of money would change anyone but we are going to try and stay grounded and live the way we've always done.' . Mr Maxwell said his experience had inspired some of his fundraising and added that his motorcycling group has raised \u00a350,000 for Macmillan nurses in the last three years. . With their money they could buy 450 semi-detached houses in Lincolnshire or eight million tonnes of the county's famous sausages. . The winning balls were 8, 20, 24, 28, 49 with lucky stars of 8 and 9. It comes in the same week that another couple - from neighbouring North Lincolnshire - beat odds of 283 billion to one to win \u00a31 million in the EuroMillions lottery for a second time. Dave and Kathleen Long, from Scunthorpe, won their first \u00a31 million in 2013 and scooped the big money prize again on Friday night. Mr Maxwell survived a prostate cancer diagnosis eight years ago and said he was glad to be here today. Colin and Chris Wear are Britain's current biggest winners after they won \u00a3161million in July 2011. Mr Long said yesterday he 'just knew it would be my turn again some day' as the couple become the first people to win \u00a31 million twice who have gone public. And the former lorry driver has not ruled out winning for a third time despite being perplexed at being labelled the luckiest man in Britain.

Police arrested 12 protesters Thursday when they tried to block trucks heading to the peak of Mauna Kea where one of the world's largest telescopes is being built. While the Native Hawaiian groups do not oppose the Thirty Meter Telescope itself, they disagree with the location of the construction on Mauna Kea - the highest point in the state which is considered a home of deities. About 300 people took part in the demonstration and those who were arrested were released after they each posted a $250 bail. Scroll down for video . Department of Land and Natural Resources officers arrest a Thirty Meter Telescope protester at the telescope building site on the summit of Mauna Kea in Hilo, Hawaii on Thursday. Thirty Meter Telescope protesters chant after being arrested from the telescope building site on the summit of Mauna Kea. Native Hawaiians believe the site where the telescope is being assembled is sacred because it is where their creation story begins, said Kealoha Pisciotta, an opponent of the telescope project. And scientists believe the site is ideal location for one of the world's largest telescopes because of its remote and sheltered position, nestled in the crater of a dormant volcano. . 'It is the burial grounds of some of our most sacred and revered ancestors,' said she said. 'It is a place where we go for sanctuary and release from the world around us, and it is also the home of our god.' All of the highest points in the islands are considered the home of deities, according to Pisciotta. 'I wouldn't consider it civil disobedience. We consider it civil assistance,' protestor Kahookahi Kanuha said reports Hawaii News Now. 'We were attempting to assist the authorities in upholding the law. . 'And those who are being disobedient to the law are those with TMT, who are continuing to break the regulations of developing on conservational land.' . After the vehicles were allowed to pass, about 40 to 50 people began following the trucks, which moved slowly because of their heavy loads. Protesters are preventing construction of a giant telescope near the summit of a mountain held sacred by Native Hawaiians. Some consider the $1.4 billion Thirty Meter Telescope project as desecrating the Big Island's Mauna Kea (on Monday protesters formed a road block outside the Mauna Kea visitors center) Department of Land and Natural Resources officers lead Thirty Meter Telescope protesters from the telescope building site on the summit of Mauna Kea on Thursday. Work got underway after protesters were arrested and their path was cleared to the summit, Sandra Dawson, a spokeswoman for the project, said in an email to The Associated Press. Police said they warned protesters after an incident Monday that anyone who blocked the road would be arrested. On Monday, more than 50 protesters formed a roadblock Monday that stopped about 15 vehicles carrying workers up Mauna Kea, causing workers to wait more than eight hours before making their way down the mountain. . 'We regret that police action had to be taken to enable our legal access to the project site,' Thirty Meter Telescope project manager Gary Sanders said in a statement relating to Thursday's arrests. Opponents who question whether land appraisals were done correctly and whether Native Hawaiian groups had been consulted have tried to prevent the construction of the telescope. . A Department of Land and Natural Resources officer, center left, comforts a Thirty Meter Telescope protester on the summit. Protests also disrupted a groundbreaking and Hawaiian blessing ceremony last year, but no one was arrested. . In fact, some protesters who yelled during the ceremony later apologized to event organizers and helped put away chairs, Pisciotta said. 'We said aloha to each other, and we hugged,' she said. University of Hawaii spokesman Dan Meisenzahl said in a telephone interview that the university is saddened about the arrests, but that access to site must be maintained. 'If the university had a heart, it would be broken right now,' he said about Thursday's arrests. However, 'we have to make sure the road is safe for whoever wants to be there.' The university sub-leases the land atop Mauna Kea for the telescope project, and it has always maintained that protesters would have free access to the site as long as they were not breaking any laws, he said. Meisenzahl said he was not certain why the arrests were made.

The vital findings have been suppressed for nearly four months, and have only emerged now after the Care Quality Commission quietly revised its report to rate many of the hospital's services as 'good'. In January the commission branded Hinchingbrooke in Cambridgeshire as 'inadequate' and placed it in special measures, along with a dozen of the worst hospitals in the country. But today the watchdog will upgrade this to 'requires improvement' and publish a glowing report. In January the commission branded Hinchingbrooke in Cambridgeshire as 'inadequate' Experts say it is further evidence that the inspection was flawed and a stitch-up by Labour Party activists and trade unionists who oppose privatisation. The new version of the report rates the hospital as 'good' in 18 out of 33 criteria that were assessed including its outpatients departments and overall standard of end-of-life care. It also praises a number of the hospital's departments and individuals as 'outstanding' including its maternity ward, intensive care unit, specialist children's nurse in A&E and the chaplain. Crucially, the report \u2013 a draft of which has been leaked to the Mail \u2013 shows that the CQC ignored a second, far more positive spot check of the hospital when it published its initial report. In January \u2013 a week before the first report came out \u2013 inspectors returned to check up on two wards where they had raised concerns about standards of care during a visit in September. They found major improvements and praised nurses for treating patients with dignity and respect, responding promptly to call bells and ensuring patients were not in pain. Yet the watchdog ignored these findings when placing the hospital in special measures. Hinchingbrooke \u2013 which serves 160,000 patients in Huntingdon \u2013 was controlled by the private firm Circle from February 2012 until last month. NHS patients were treated there as usual but Circle \u2013 rather than NHS managers \u2013 was in charge of the day-to-day running of the hospital and its budget. The firm was praised for driving down waiting times, lowering the death rate, reducing infections and improving overall care. After January's report Circle announced it would be withdrawing from its contract. The hospital is now being run by the NHS Trust Development Authority. The rating of 'requires improvement' in the revised report moves the hospital from the bottom 13 per cent of hospital trusts in the country to an average score, which is achieved by 59 per cent of organisations. Today the watchdog will upgrade the 'inadequate' finding to 'requires improvement' and publish a glowing report. The Mail has repeatedly highlighted concerns by MPs and doctors that the inspection was flawed and a sabotage attempt by those opposed to privatisation. One of the inspectors was a member of the campaign group Keep Our NHS Public. Another was a senior figure in the British Medical Association, the doctors' trade union, who had previously spoken out about the dangers of private firms' involvement in the NHS. Neither took part in the spot checks a week before January's report. Tory MEP David Campbell Bannerman said: 'This is an extraordinary procedure and raises serious questions about how the CQC goes about its inspections. 'It's an admission by the watchdog that its first inspection report was over the top and far too tough. It's all been heavily influenced by the public service unions. I will be writing to the Health Secretary to demand a full investigation into whether this was a stitch-up.' A spokesman for Circle said: 'This vindicates our view that the inspection of Hinchingbrooke was flawed. The evidence has always been that Hinchingbrooke was a good hospital, with low mortality rates, low waiting times, and positive reviews from other NHS regulators.' .", "hypo": ["Care Quality Commission branded Hinchingbrooke in Cambridgeshire as 'inadequate' But today the watchdog will upgrade this to 'requires improvement' Experts say it is further evidence that the inspection was flawed and a stitch-up by Labour Party activists and trade unionists who oppose privatisation.", "Care Quality Commission branded Hinchingbrooke in Cambridgeshire as 'inadequate' But today the watchdog will upgrade this to 'requires improvement' Experts say it is further evidence that the inspection was flawed and a stitch-up.", "In January the commission branded Hinchingbrooke in Cambridgeshire as 'inadequate'", "In January the commission branded Hinchingbrooke in Cambridgeshire as 'inadequate'", "In January the commission branded Hinchingbrooke in Cambridgeshire as 'inadequate' Today the watchdog will upgrade this to 'requires improvement' Experts say it is further evidence that the inspection was flawed and a stitch-up by Labour Party activists and trade unionists.", "In January the commission branded Hinchingbrooke in Cambridgeshire as 'inadequate' But today the watchdog will upgrade this to 'requires improvement' It also praises a number of the hospital's departments and individuals as 'outstanding' This includes its maternity ward, intensive care unit, specialist children's nurse in A&E and the chaplain.", "In January the commission branded Hinchingbrooke in Cambridgeshire as 'inadequate' But today the watchdog will upgrade this to 'requires improvement' and publish a glowing report.

Her case drew national attention after she started carrying a mattress around campus to protest the school's handling of the complaint, saying she hoped to show how \"flawed\" the university disciplinary system is when it comes to sexual misconduct cases. CNN does not usually name individuals in sexual assault cases, but in this instance, both parties have spoken publicly about their experience. They have also both said in separate interviews with The New York Times that Nungesser was cleared of responsibility in a disciplinary hearing. Nungesser, an international student from Germany, filed a federal discrimination lawsuit last week against the school; its president, Lee Bollinger; and the visual arts professor who oversaw Sulkowicz's mattress project, \"Carry That Weight,\" as part of her senior thesis. The lawsuit alleges the defendants violated Nungesser's right to an education free of gender-based discrimination by allowing Sulkowicz to speak out against him after he had been cleared of wrongdoing. During an April 2014 news conference at Columbia University, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand stood alongside Sulkowicz as she called Nungesser a \"serial rapist\" and said she fears for her safety while he's still on campus. The harassment continued, the lawsuit claims, when Columbia visual arts professor Jon Kessler let Sulkowicz \"transform her personal vendetta\" into a \"Columbia-sponsored calumny\" by supporting \"Carry That Weight\" for her senior thesis, allowing her to earn school credit through \"this outrageous display of harassment and defamation.\" Bollinger also commented on the case in a 2014 New York Magazine profile of Sulkowicz, now a senior at Columbia. \"This is a person who is one of my students, and I care about all of my students. And when one of them feels that she has been a victim of mistreatment, I am affected by that. This is all very painful.\" The defendants \"had the power, as well as the legal and contractual obligation\" to protect Nungesser, who is also a senior, the lawsuit claims. \"By refusing to protect Paul Nungesser, Columbia University first became a silent bystander and then turned into an active supporter of a fellow student's harassment campaign by institutionalizing it and heralding it.\" Columbia University declined to comment on the lawsuit. The school also declined to confirm the outcome of Nungesser's disciplinary proceedings. \"As we have said consistently, we do not and have not commented on individual students or disciplinary cases not only because of federal student privacy law, but also because of our ethical responsibility to ensure all current and future students have confidence that the university will never publicly discuss private matters they share when interacting with counselors and support staff, the campus disciplinary process or other resources we provide to them,\" spokesman Robert Hornsby said in statement. Kessler also declined to comment on the lawsuit. The case has produced dueling narratives from both sides in national media outlets. The most recent came from Nungesser in a Daily Beast article titled, \"Columbia Student: I Didn't Rape Her,\" in which he shared a long exchange of Facebook messages to support his claim that their sex was consensual. Some of those exchanges were included in the lawsuit, but Sulkowicz told CNN they were taken out of context in the suit. She also balked at the idea that Nungesser would sue the school or her professor \"for allowing me to make an art piece.\" \"It's ridiculous that he would read it as a 'bullying strategy,' especially given his continued public attempts to smear my reputation, when really it's just an artistic expression of the personal trauma I've experienced at Columbia,\" Sulkowicz wrote in an email. \"If artists are not allowed to make art that reflects on our experiences, then how are we to heal?\" The project essentially consists of Sulkowicz carrying a twin-size mattress wherever she goes on campus, but not off campus. She's allowed to accept help carrying the object but does not allow herself to ask for help.\u200b. Nungesser's complaint seeks damages to be determined at trial for harm to his reputation, loss of educational opportunities and future career prospects.

The Conservative leader was pulled up on the error after the speech, which he read from an autocue, though the party has since admitted it was not included in his prepared text but was an off the cuff remark. It was omitted from the official transcript of his speech issued by the Conservative Party. . Cameron blamed his gaffe on a 'brain fade' like that suffered by Green Party leader Natalie Bennett earlier in the campaign. . He said: 'I'm a Villa fan ... I must have been overcome by something ... this morning. 'But there we are, these things sometimes happen when you are on the stump.' The two teams do both play in a claret blue colours - albeit in stadiums 130 miles apart. . Only last week Cameron tweeted his delight at Villa reaching the FA Cup final by beating Liverpool 2-1 at Wembley. . He told the Birmingham Mail: 'It was a tremendous game with [club stars] Benteke and Delph doing Villa proud, against the odds. I can't wait to watch the final at the end of May.' .

The PM has been a Villa fan since his teens and is pictured here during a game against QPR in 2011. Piers Morgan was one of a number of football fans to lay in to the Prime Minister on Twitter over his error. His error was swiftly seized upon by his political rivals, as the hashtag #villagate began trending on Twitter. Labour's former communications chief Alastair Campbell - whose own team Burnley also play in claret and blue - said the mistake 'says a lot about his character which impacts upon policy. Out of touch. Phoney. Believes nothing.' Campbell said every sports fan would have their 'stomach churning' to hear the PM apparently forget the name of the team he supported, adding: 'I am sorry but this alone means Cameron has to go. Total million percent phoney, as (Villa manager) Tim Sherwood might say.' Shadow chancellor Ed Balls, a fervent Norwich City fan, tweeted: 'Hey David Cameron ... I'm off to see that football team I support this afternoon. Name escapes me ... they play in yellow ... Watford?' But former Conservative press officer Jonathan Collett, a fellow Villa supporter, said he believed the mistake was down to an error in Mr Cameron's speech. 'PM is a passionate Villa fan. Takes son to matches ... Suspect speechwriter error,' said Mr Collett. Soon after the prime minister's gaffe comedian Matt Lucas took to Twitter, creating an amusing new team name. He posted: 'David Cameron just remembered his favourite football team is Weston Villham.' While former England footballer Gary Lineker posted a video of the 'brain fade' and wrote: 'David Cameron has forgotten which Football Club he supports. Aston Villa last week, West Ham this. Burnely next?'. . Cameron backed Aston Villa's new manager Tim Sherwood (pictured) to make an impact in the club's bid to stave off Premier League relegation. Nigel Farage also made fun of Cameron, telling PA he not make 'pretences' about football teams he supports and then change them but revealed his son is a Crystal Palace season ticket holder. The UKIP leader said: 'My grandfather was a Crystal Palace supporter, my grandmother was, my eldest son is a season ticket holder, he's there this afternoon, there's a match against Hull today. 'Football's not a big part of my life but I don't make pretences about teams I support and then chop and change them.' When he was first elected to Parliament in 2001, Cameron said he did not follow football, telling the House of Commons in a debate on hooliganism that year: 'Many of those who have spoken in the debate or have written about the subject are either lawyers or football fans, but I have to confess that I am neither.' The first mentions in the national press of his liking for Aston Villa came after he was elected Tory leader in 2005. He was reported in 2006 to have written on his blog that he 'half-heartedly' supported Villa and could name only three of their players. . Mr Cameron was asked about the slip-up in an interview with Sky News' Murnaghan to be broadcast tomorrow. Asked to confirm which team he actually supports, he said: 'I've been an Aston Villa fan all my life, I literally opened my mouth and I was going off-piste about the fact that in Britain you can be a supporter of the West Indies, a supporter of Manchester United, and a supporter of Team GB. 'I was then busking about other things you can support and was ... I don't know what happened to me, it was just one of those things.'

The Indiana native, who was diagnosed with a rare form of brain cancer shortly after her 18th birthday, had defied doctors' expectations after they told her that she would not live past December. Instead, she played four games with her team at Mount St. Joseph University in Cincinnati and raised more than $1.5 million for research into the cancer, Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma. But as her condition worsened, she became an honorary coach and earlier this year, she moved to Cincinnati Children's Hospital, where she passed away on Friday morning. Scroll down for video . Loss: Lauren Hill, who is pictured playing for Mount St. Joseph University in Cincinnati in November, died in hospital on Friday - aged just 19 - after a brave battle with a rare form of brain cancer. Just a year and a half ago, Hill was just another high school student getting ready for college after she decided to play basketball at Mount St. Joseph. A few weeks later, she started experiencing dizziness while playing for her high school team in nearby Lawrenceburg, Indiana. Tests found the tumor and she was told that she had less than two years left. But in September, doctors told her she wouldn't make it past December - and after years as a standout high school basketball player, Hill's hopes of playing college ball were put in jeopardy. But the NCAA granted permission to move the school's opening game forward because of her worsening condition, and on November 2, she realized her dream of playing for the school. . She scored the first and last baskets of the team's 66-55 victory over Hiram College. 'It's a dream come true,' she said. 'To play on a college court, to put my foot down on the floor and hear the roar of the crowd - I just love it so much. I love basketball. 'Everything that happened today was amazing. I'm truly happy, it's a really good day.' . Diagnosis: Lauren is pictured left in December 2013 and right in December 2014 after her treatment for Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma, a rare childhood brain cancer, changed her appearance. Brave: Hill, who used her limited energy to inspire people and raise money for research into the cancer that ultimately took her life, is pictured in her room in Cincinnati last December. Final days: Lauren is pictured enjoying Easter and St Patrick's Day from hospital in Cincinnati. At the game, she said she wanted to find a cure for the rare cancer, which has a less than 10 per cent survival rate and most often affects children aged four to nine. . Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is a type of brain tumor found in the part of the brainstem at the lower back of the brain. Due to the tumor's location, it can cause double vision, difficulty controlling eye movement and facial expressions, and difficulty swallowing and chewing. It may also cause weakness in the limbs. The condition primarily affects children most often between the ages of four and nine. . Between 100 and 150 new diagnoses are made a year in the U.S. Only 300 are made across North America and Europe a year. It can be treated with radiation, but chemotherapy is generally not effective and surgery is impossible due to the spread of the cancer into healthy tissue. Unlike with other childhood cancers, there has been little progress in improving treatments and cure rates for the condition over the last few decades. Fewer than 10 per cent of children with DIPG survive two years after their diagnosis. Source: DIPG Registry . 'When I was diagnosed I remember kind of feeling lonely because nobody understood,' she said following the game, USA Today reported. 'And now that more people know about this story and the awareness of DIPG. 'I'm so happy that people know about it now and that we can get some research going and hopefully find that home run cure for cancer. And even though I'm probably not going to be around to see it, it's going to help a lot of people.' Hill played in four games and made five layups before the spreading tumor made her stop. When the season ended, her team held its annual dinner in the hospital where Hill was being treated. She was also honored at local sporting events and was featured on a box of Wheaties - known as the Breakfast of Champions. The U.S. Basketball Writers Association voted her the Pat Summitt Most Courageous Award, which is normally awarded at the Final Four. Athletes from other colleges autographed No. 22 jerseys - her number - and sent them in support. As the cancer slowed her down, her family, friends and teammates took a bigger role in promoting her fundraising campaign - and she kept reminding everyone to appreciate life. 'Life is precious,' she told WKRC-TV. 'Every moment you get with someone is a moment that's blessed, really blessed.' The co-founder of her nonprofit foundation confirmed Lauren's death in hospital on Friday. Fighter: The NCAA moved the school's first game forward last November (pictured) so that Lauren could achieve her dream of playing for collegiate basketball. She scored the first and last baskets. Heroic: Hill, left, smiles at Pat Summitt after receiving the Pat Summitt Award during halftime of her first NCAA college basketball game in November last year. She went on to play four games for the school. 'Through Lauren's fundraising and advocacy efforts, she not only became a spotlight on the lack of funding for cancer research, but she most certainly has become a beacon guiding researchers for years to come,' The Cure Starts Now co-founder Brooke Desserich said. Her nonprofit foundation helped to raise more than $1.5 million for cancer research. 'She's made an impact on the world, more so than me - more than I ever will do,' her coach Dan Benjamin said. 'I've gotten so many emails and phone calls from all over the world. People are contacting me because they want to share her story.'", "hypo": ["Lauren Hill was diagnosed with Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma shortly after her 18th birthday.", "Lauren Hill was diagnosed with Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma shortly after her 18th birthday.", "Lauren Hill, from Lawrenceburg, Indiana, was diagnosed with Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma shortly after her 18th birthday.", "Lauren Hill was diagnosed with Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma shortly after her 18th birthday.

Scroll down for video . 'That's not going to happen': Baltimore police commissioner Anthony Batts ruled out his resignation despite that fact that his deputy admitted they should have sought medical attention for Freddie Gray. Batts addressed a news conference in Baltimore on Friday amid growing calls for him to step down. Concession: Police admit they should have sought medical help for Freddie Gray (pictured being detained on April 12) when he requested assistance in the police car. He was later pronounced dead . Commissioner Batts said the investigation is being refined and the picture is getting 'sharper and sharper.' He did not elaborate. As for calls for his resignation, he said: 'That's not going to happen.' Gray, who is black, was arrested April 12 after he made eye contact with officers and ran away, police said. . Officers held him down, handcuffed him and loaded him into a police van. While inside, he became irate and leg cuffs were put on him, police have said. Gray died on Sunday, April 19, after he 'had his spine 80 per cent severed at his neck' while in police custody. Gray was not buckled in by a seat belt, a violation of the police department's policy. He asked for medical help several times, and after a 30-minute ride that included three stops, paramedics were called. . At some point - either during his arrest or inside the van - he suffered a mysterious spinal injury. Authorities have not explained how or when it occurred. Deputy police commissioner Kevin Davis said Friday that Gray should have received medical attention at the spot of his arrest. .

She expects the results of the investigation to be turned over to prosecutors in a week, and they will decide whether any criminal charges will be filed. 'I will not deny we have had a very long and complicated history on issues such as these,' Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake said. . 'But it's important to remember that we have an equally long history of peaceful and legal protest.' Asked if Gray's possible 'rough ride' is a one-off, the mayor said: 'It's clearly not a one-off. . The reason we have the policy around seat belts in the police vans is because of an incident that happened previously,' referring to Dondi Johnson. . He died of a fractured spine in 2005 after he was arrested for urinating in public and transported without a seat belt, with his hands cuffed behind his back. Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake speaks in front of local faith leaders at a news conference regarding the death of Freddie Gray on Friday. She appeared to support the police with her statements. Captain Erik Pecha of the Baltimore Police Department exchanges words with young demonstrators. More than 50 officers manned a barricade surrounding the station, separating them from the protesters. Protesters for Freddie Gray stand outside the Baltimore Police Department's Western District police station. The protest was peaceful, though some in the crowd hurled insults at the officers behind the fence, who stared back stone-faced. Angela Hazel (C) reacts near City Hall during a protest against the death of Freddie Gray Hazel said 'I lost my child to the streets, too. My only child...' The leader of a group of local ministers called on Batts to resign immediately. 'It seems that no one in the police department can explain what happened,' said the Rev. Alvin Gwynn Sr., president of the Interdenominational Ministerial Alliance of Baltimore. He said the police department is 'in disarray' and Batts has shown a 'lack of viable leadership capabilities.' The mayor appeared to back the police commissioner at her own news conference. 'Nickel rides' have caused spinal injuries in the past and Baltimore police epartment rules were updated nine days before Gray's arrest stating that all detainees shall be strapped in by seat belts or other device. The president of a black lawyers' group predicted thousands of people would turn out Saturday, when good weather is forecast and the Orioles are hosting the Boston Red Sox in a Major League Baseball game. 'Things will change on Saturday, and the struggle will be amplified,' said Malik Shabazz of Black Lawyers for Justice. Shabazz rejected the notion that he was an outside agitator who would stir up trouble. Bernard Young, Baltimore City Council president said prior to a rally on Thursday that he hoped citizens wouldn't let 'outside forces come in here and dictate how we act by destroying our infrastructure.'

Thirteen people were killed and 31 were injured in the 2009 attack carried out by an Army psychiatrist who is now on military death row. . Following years of tension, the Army gave the Purple Hearts to survivors and relatives of the dead in a somber ceremony on the Texas military post, just two miles from where Nidal Hasan had opened fire in a room of unarmed soldiers. Top military commanders recalled tables that became makeshift stretchers to transport the wounded and dying. Ten of the survivors remain on active duty. 'It is our sincere hope that in some small way this will help heal the wounds you have suffered,' Army Lt. Gen. Sean MacFarland said. But words of gratitude from military leaders and elected officials, including Republican Texas senators John Cornyn and Ted Cruz, gave way to medal recipients pressing and chastising the Pentagon over combat benefits. The Purple Heart, given to military personnel wounded in battle, offers increased retirement pay. Cornyn said he expects Fort Hood victims to finally get approved for entitlements within weeks, noting that he spoke to Army Secretary John McHugh before the ceremony. Terrorist: Hasan (pictured) was convicted by a military judge in 2013 in the killings, and he recommended the death penalty. He snapped: Army psychiatrist Major Nidal Hasan opened fire on November 5, 2009, killing 13 men and women at the military post in Killeen, Texas, injuring 30 others before he was shot himself. Rememberence: Joleen Cahill, foreground, wife of Michael Cahill who was killed during the attack by Major Nidal Hasan , carries her husband's Defense of Freedom Medal back to her chair. Many survivors are also seeking separate financial damages in a lawsuit, claiming the U.S. government should have known of Hasan's extremist views. During his 2013 trial, Hasan told jurors he had 'switched sides' in what he called America's war with Islam. He admitted beginning the rampage by pulling out a pistol and shouting 'Allahu akbar' (God is great) and said he wanted to stop American soldiers from being deployed to kill fellow Muslims. Kimberly Munley, a Fort Hood police officer at the time, helped end the attack in a gunfight with Hasan. She was awarded the Defense of Freedom medal but after the ceremony expressed frustration over uncertainty about the level of benefits Fort Hood victims would receive. 'These soldiers are going to get what they rightfully deserve,' Munley said. The award: Dozens of Purple Hearts and two Defense of Freedom Medals were awarded at Fort Hood, Texas to victims and family of the 2009 terrorist attack. Military officials had long denied the Purple Heart awards because they called the attack an act of workplace violence, not terrorism. Cornyn and others have long condemned that classification, but he said changing the distinction could have jeopardized the case against Hasan, who was not charged with terrorism. Last year, Congress approved new eligibility requirements for Purple Hearts that forced the Defense Department to reconsider. The daughter of Michael Cahill, a physician's assistant who was the only civilian killed in the attack, accepted the Defense of Freedom medal for her father and used the occasion to draw attention to veteran suicides. Cahill was shot while as he rushed toward Hasan with a chair lifted over his head. 'The first month after dad died, everyone asked us, \"What can I do?\" And it was great,'Kerry Cahill said. .

The revised policy comes in response to a June ruling by a federal judge that said the old process was in violation of the Fifth Amendment's guarantee of due process. The decision was part of an American Civil Liberties Union lawsuit brought on behalf of 13 Americans on the list. But the ACLU isn't satisfied with the government's new policy, outlined in documents filed Monday in federal courts in Oregon (PDF) and Virginia (PDF). \"After years of fighting in court for complete secrecy and losing, it's good that the government is finally now going to tell people of their status on the No Fly List,\" said Hina Shamsi, director of the ACLU National Security Project and the lead attorney on the case, in a statement. \"Unfortunately, we've found that the government's new redress process falls far short of constitutional requirements because it denies our clients meaningful notice, evidence, and a hearing. The government had an opportunity to come up with a fair process but failed, so we're challenging it in court again.\" People on the no-fly list, managed by the FBI's Terrorist Screening Center, are prohibited from boarding a commercial flight for travel into or out of the United States. The number of people on the list is classified. An official with knowledge of the government's figures told CNN in 2012 that the list contained about 21,000 names, including about 500 Americans. Before the change, American citizens and permanent residents who inquired with the government about being denied aircraft boarding received a letter that neither confirmed nor denied their inclusion on the no-fly list.

The Serbian world number one has been an unstoppable force in recent weeks, winning 17 matches on the bounce and becoming the first man to win the season's first three Masters title. He comfortably beat Nadal on his beloved red clay in last week's Monte Carlo Masters semi-finals, and the nature of Djokovic's 6-3 6-3 mauling means plenty are backing him to complete his collection of grand slam titles this year by winning his first French Open. Rafa Nadal practices in Barcelona as he steps up his clay-court preparation ahead of the French Open. Nadal was beaten convincingly by Novak Djokovic in MOnet Carlo last week. But as far as Nadal is concerned, 2015 is no different to 2013, 2012 or even 2011. 'Djokovic was good in 2011, in 2012, 2013 as well as in 2015. Sometimes you win more and some you win less,' Nadal, who has triumphed at the French Open in nine of the last 10 years, told reporters at the Barcelona Open. 'It is difficult to win everything all the time. Djokovic was as good then in 2011 as he is now. He had an impeccable year in 2011 as well as he is having in 2015. I have to congratulate him. Djokovic is World No 1 and in superb form, but Nadal insists he has no worries about Roland Garros. The Spaniard is looking to win a sixth consecutive French Open, and a tenth in total. 'The rest of the players have to accept that at the moment he is the world number one with all he has achieved this year,' added Nadal, who has had a patchy year after making his comeback in January following another lengthy injury and illness break. 'This year I have to do things right, get back to a very high level to face him on the court,' Nadal said. 'Tennis-wise, I feel a lot better than a few weeks ago. I am going to try to get as far as I can and to play as well as I can, topping the level I showed in Monte Carlo.'

Friday is also Sukumaran's 34th birthday which could well be his last as the pair contemplate the prospect of facing a firing squad on Execution Island in Java. . The talented artist's birthday is being marked in London where his cousin has organised an exhibition of his paintings at the Amnesty International headquarters. . Meanwhile, the pair are in an isolated cell pinning their hopes on yet another legal quest for mercy which rests with a court that has previously recommended an option of a life sentence for reformed inmates. Myuran Sukumaran has put all of his energy into his art while spending 10 years in Kerobokan jail. His cousin Niranjela Karunatilake is currently holding an exhibition of his artwork in London. Sukumaran (left) and Andrew Chan (right) await their fate on Execution Island in Java - exactly a decade after they were arrested. The pair were identified as leaders of the plot to smuggle 8.3kg of heroin, taped to the bodies of young mules, on April 17, 2005, and sentenced to death. Since they were refused clemency earlier this year, their lawyers have been desperate to show the courts their rehabilitation over the past decade. Chan is now a pastor and Sukumaran a painter, and both had a hugely positive impact on fellow inmates at Kerobokan jail. Sukumaran's skill and love for his art grew as he was mentored by well-known Australian artist Ben Quilty - who has also led the charge in the mercy campaign to save the pair's lives. Painting has proven a great sense of solace for Sukumaran during his time in jail and has even run art classes for fellow inmates as part of the drug rehabilitation program that he set up with Chan. His cousin, Niranjela Karunatilake, last visited her cousin on death row in February. . Niranjela said it was: ' just too sad to think that could be his last birthday'. 'The death penalty is never the answer and I don't believe it deters crime, but in Myu's case, when he has done so much to repent and improve prison conditions, it would be a real tragedy if his life was cut short,' she said. 'We are not asking for Myu to be freed, all we ask is for mercy, that he keeps his life and continues his positive impact on the Indonesian prison system and other inmates.' Friday is also Sukumaran's 34th birthday which could well be his last as the pair contemplate the prospect of facing a firing squad on Execution Island in Java. Karunatilake said his skill has developed over the past four years and she can see him finding himself in his paintings. His cousin Niranjela said it was: ' just too sad to think that could be his last birthday' Sukumaran's skill and love for his art grew as he was mentored by well-known Australian artist Ben Quilty - who has also led the charge in the mercy campaign to save the pair's lives. Their Melbourne barrister Julian McMahon visited the men last week, and says they are well. As he waits for the constitutional court to respond to a new bid to challenge the clemency process, Mr McMahon recalls the court's 2007 recommendation on the death penalty. While it upheld its constitutional validity, the court recommended that death row prisoners who showed rehabilitation after 10 years had the option of being re-sentenced to a fixed term. 'There's absolutely no doubt my two clients have done a heroic job in reforming themselves and many others,' Mr McMahon said. 'I see that as an opportunity to enliven the constitutional court jurisprudence.' President Joko Widodo refused clemency to the men citing a 'drugs emergency' but has the authority to reverse the decision. No date has been fixed for the executions of the Sydney men and eight other drug offenders, but officials say they're considering a date after the Asian African Conference ends on April 24. . 'We are not asking for Myu to be freed, all we ask is for mercy, that he keeps his life and continues his positive impact on the Indonesian prison system and other inmates,' Niranjela said. Sukumaran taught inmates how to paint as part of the drug rehabilitation program he set up with Chan. Niranjela said her cousin has done so much to repent and improve prison conditions, it would be a real tragedy if his life was cut short' \u201cIt\u2019s clear painting has been a vital comfort for him on death row,' Niranjela said. 'I hope people will come to see the exhibition next week, and think of Myu and let Indonesia know that there are people all over the world calling for mercy': she said.", "hypo": ["Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan were sentenced to death for their role in the Bali Nine drug smuggling operation in 2005.

Recent images show intrepid residents from Lijin village in Dongying city carry the explosive in bags as long as six metres on rickshaws, reported the People\u2019s Daily Online. Worried passers-by compared this behaviour to carrying a bomb on their backs because any contact with a naked flame or even a cigarette could spell disaster. Gas-guzzler: Carrying natural gas in huge plastic bags is a common scene in some villages in Shandong. Penny-pinching: Local media suggest this is a way for villages to save money on the transportation of gas. This reckless behaviour has been reported on as early as May 2011 in Zibo city in Shandong. It has since spread to different parts of the province. Netizens and media suggest this is a way for the locals to save money on transportation. Some suggest they are actually stealing gas. An earlier undercover investigation by Anhui Satellite TV Station shows that villagers in Zibo have little understanding of the dangers, claiming it to be safe. Unaware of danger: Previous investigation discovered that residents had little understanding of the hazards. The news clip documented villagers and even school pupils stealing gas from a large roadside container. .

A picture of Bahar Mustafa, 27, student union Welfare and Diversity Officer at Goldsmiths University in London, pretending to cry was posted online as she was being accused of discrimination. The handmade poster also refers to a ban on 'cis' or cisgender men, a term used of those whose mental gender and physical sex match, which is the opposite of transgender. Message: This picture of Bahar Mustafa, the student union Welfare and Diversity Officer at Goldsmiths University, shows her posing in front if a 'no white men' sign while pretending to cry. Row: Ms Mustafa appeared to ban men and white people from attending the meeting in this Facebook post. The photograph first appeared on Miss Mustafa's Facebook profile on Tuesday, six days after she told white people and men 'not to come' to a meeting she was organising to discuss 'diversifying the curriculum'. . She wrote on Facebook last week: \u2018Invite loads of BME [black and minority ethnic] Women and non-binary people!! Also, if you\u2019ve been invited and you\u2019re a man and/or white PLEASE DON\u2019T COME just cos i invited a bunch of people and hope you will be responsible enough to respect this is a BME Women and non-binary event only.\u2019. Non-binary is a term used to describe people who do not consider themselves exclusively male or female. . Miss Mustafa, 27, added: \u2018Don\u2019t worry lads we will give you and allies things to do\u2019, followed by a wink. . The event\u2019s online page said it was open to \u2018self-defining BLACK and ETHNIC MINORITY women and non-binary people with gender identities that include \u201cwoman\u201d.\u2019 . A notice about the meeting later appeared to show the ban had been dropped, stating: 'Allies now welcome!' . Miss Mustafa, pictured at a demonstration, describes herself as a \u2018queer, anti-racist feminist killjoy\u2019 and previously organised a 'BME ONLY social\u2019 before showing the film Dear White People. The post was met with outrage by students of the university, one of whom described the exclusive policy as 'patronising beyond belief'. The story was covered by student newspaper The Tab just hours after Miss Mustafa first posted the image. Goldsmiths' union eventually backed down after a backlash from students. The ban on men and white students is surprising, since the organisers claim to promote \u2018zero tolerance\u2019 for \u2018all forms of prejudice, discrimination and oppression\u2019. A senior union member told student newspaper The Tab that Miss Mustafa\u2019s actions had made it \u2018very difficult\u2019 for male students. . In the hours after the story made national news yesterday, a friend of Miss Mustafa again posted the picture of her pretending to cry to Facebook. He wrote: 'When you thought the cup in the picture was big enough for white tears'. In February, Miss Mustafa, whose Twitter biography says she is \u2018queer, anti-racist feminist killjoy\u2019, also organised a 'BME ONLY social\u2019 before showing the film Dear White People. . Today her friends posted supportive messages on her Facebook page and also offered her a place to stay if she needed it. But not everyone was so supportive. One Facebook friend, called Jessie, wrote: 'You do not speak for me. I voted you into the position of Welfare and Diversity Officer. 'Your passion is inspiring. But I can't defend this. We cannot best \"them\" by being them. We cannot demand to be included by excluding. . 'To specifically exclude a group of people from any event is to become the oppressor. As the oppressed, we should not wish to inflict upon others that pain which we know to be harmful to us. 'This is not the Goldsmiths I love'. . Bahar Mustafa, student union Welfare and Diversity Officer at Goldsmiths University in London, sparked anger when she banned men and white people from a 'diversity' meeting. Graduate: Miss Mustafa recently completed an MA in gender and media studies and won election to become the union's Welfare and Diversity Officer. Miss Mustafa recently graduated from Goldsmiths with an MA in gender and media studies. Criticism: Critics have said that Miss Mustafa\u2019s actions had made it \u2018very difficult\u2019 for male students but friends have also defended her. She is understood to live with her mother Nursen, 55, father Ismail, 57, and sister Ipek, 23, in Enfield in a \u00a3450,000 three-bedroom terrace. The Daily Mail tried to contact Miss Mustafa but she was not available to explain the comments apparently posted from her Facebook account. . A friend told MailOnline she 'does not want to talk to you'. Yesterday a spokesman for Goldsmiths said the university had no part in the decisions of the union, adding: \u2018We are proud of our diverse community and do not tolerate any form of oppression, including racism, sexism or any other form of bigotry. \u2018We have written to the students\u2019 union to express our concern.\u2019. The union said: \u2018Goldsmiths Students\u2019 Union places huge importance on equality and diversity. \u2018It is in this vein that we host spaces where specific minority groups who experience similar discrimination can talk together confidently about overcoming the structural disadvantages and prejudice they face. \u2018The accusation that we discriminate is one we refute wholeheartedly'. . Goldsmiths has insisted the Student Union is a separate organisation over which it has no control. .", "hypo": ["Bahar Mustafa, 27, banned men and white people from meeting at Goldsmiths.", "Bahar Mustafa, 27, is Welfare and Diversity Officer at Goldsmiths University.", "Bahar Mustafa, 27, is Welfare and Diversity Officer at Goldsmiths University.

It's the most popular board game in the world, with hundreds of versions springing up in far-flung cities across the globe. But Monopoly-makers planning a special Exeter edition have been told there is nowhere low-rent enough to fill the space of Old Kent Road. Thousands of voters have suggested landmarks across the city in Devon to fill the more expensive slots, which are taken up on the London version by the likes of Mayfair and Park Lane. But no one has come forward with ideas for which streets should fill the brown sections of the board, which cost $60 in Monopoly money. . High-end game zones have been easily filled with locations like the city's Gothic cathedral, Exeter castle, the Guildhall and modern shopping centre. But Exeter has outdone all previous cities to get their own board - including Oxford, Cambridge and York - in the posh stakes, with no suggestions for the lower end. Game-makers say they have developed boards for cities across the country but have never come across the current dilemma. Exeter City Council Leader Pete Edwards said there were no areas suitable for the brown spots, which are taken up in London by Old Kent Road and Whitechapel Road. He said: 'I think they will have a problem - there is nowhere cheap in Exeter that would be suitable for the Old Kent Road spot. 'I don't know about being the poshest - but it is such a nice city that no-where really deserves to occupy it. Thousands of voters have suggested landmarks across Exeter to fill the more expensive slots, such as the cathedral. No one has come forward with ideas for which streets should fill the brown sections of the board, which cost $60 in Monopoly money. 'The board was designed on the streets of London and it is a nigh on impossible task to replicate that in Exeter. 'Whoever does get Old Kent Road will be castigated for it - and will not deserve it.' Exeter recently for opened some Britain's poshest student flats in the city centre - costing \u00a31,000 a month - and there are several more luxury developments planned. The influx of well-to-do students - together with the arrival of big name shops and restaurants such as John Lewis and Jamie's Italian in recent years - has seen a resurgence in the city centre. . Resident Nicola Taylor, 32, of Exeter, said: 'Exeter has certainly got posher over the years and I don't think there is anywhere that deserves the tag of Old Kent Road. 'I think the influx of rich students has had a lot to do with it with a lot of luxury developments and money being brought in. 'I wouldn't say that most locals are particularly posh - but just proud of the area they live in.' Exeter City Council Leader Pete Edwards said there were no areas suitable for the brown Monopoly (board game pictured) spots, which are taken up in London by Old Kent Road and Whitechapel Road. The makers of the game have launched a second appeal for recommendations for any Exeter landmark that can replace Old Kent Road, and bosses were sent to the city today to hunt a location down. Dan Taylor, Head of Custom Games at Winning Moves UK said: 'Over the years we have produced boards for perceived well-heeled places - such as Oxford, for example - but we have never come across a situation like this. 'We have had a dearth of suggestions for an Exeter equivalent of Old Kent Road compared to every other location so Exeter could well be the poshest place in Britain. 'But we have to fill this space. As we do every one of the 22 locations from the London original is handed over to an Exeter landmark or address.'", "hypo": ["Thousands have suggested landmarks across Exeter to fill the more expensive slots.

{"entity": ["America", "Ohio", "Congress", "Washington", "the House Budget Committee"], "article": "Is America a nation divided? And has Ohio found a better way to bridge those divisions? It's hard not to be concerned with these questions given the constant drumbeat of news about the issues that tear us apart as a nation: immigration, community and police relations, poverty, education and dozens of other crucial matters facing America. Adding to our divisions is a harsh public atmosphere where politicians are preoccupied with how they can win the next election or give the best sound bite, and where lobby groups work to protect their narrow self-interests while ignoring a broader vision of what is best for our country. In Ohio, we have been able to drive meaningful change on many thorny issues that have held our state back in the past -- social services, criminal justice, economic competiveness, infrastructure -- and I've enjoyed sharing our state's winning formula with others in my travels. In 2011, I returned to public service -- after earlier serving for 18 years in Congress in the 1980s and '90s. Over the intervening years, Ohio had lost its way and was hurting. I felt called to help after knowing that members of 350,000 Ohio families had lost their jobs and were looking to get back on their feet. Ohio is much stronger today. And that turnaround and success are worth being excited about and sharing. For example, we have gone from 89 cents in our rainy day fund and an $8 billion shortfall to now having one of the nation's strongest state budgets and a nearly $2 billion surplus. We've gone from losing 350,000 private-sector jobs to creating about 340,000 new ones. We've gone from very high taxes across the board to the largest tax cuts in of any state in America, including tax cuts for the working poor. We're seeing wages grow faster than the national average and Ohio's unemployment rate drop to the lowest level in more than a decade. Getting Ohio back on track wasn't easy. It required big ideas, going against the status quo and tuning out those who worry only about protecting their own special interests. Yes, we have a great success story to tell about our state. And we need to make Ohio's success contagious. The leadership style that helped us turn around Ohio is needed in Washington, where America's $18 trillion debt ticks higher each day and our congressional leaders would struggle even to pass a resolution saluting Mother's Day if it required their action. Great leaders are not primarily guided by polls, political parties, focus groups, re-election, special interests or protecting the status quo. Instead they bring teams of people together, challenge them to innovate and engage both sides to work together to fashion solutions based on common sense and the common good. As the chairman of the House Budget Committee in Congress in the 1990s, I helped craft the first balanced budget since man walked on the moon. We worked in a bipartisan effort that doesn't happen enough. There were, of course, disagreements along the way, but they never overshadowed the shared values we had to guide our work and the shared goal of fiscal responsibility and seeing our country live within its means. Given the polarizing issues facing our country, America needs a leader who believes in a common set of fundamental values necessary to bring about change that will unite our country without being blinded by the many distractions that ego, selfishness and power produce. Leaders who focus only on themselves and their own good have rejected this value-driven approach and make it impossible to make progress on our most pressing issues such as balanced budgets, tax cuts, welfare reform, border security, immigration and health care. We see it every day. There are certain values that guide great countries:. \u2022 Personal responsibility: It obligates us to be accountable for ourselves so we can then do our duty for our families and our communities. \u2022 Empathy: It allows us to walk in someone else's shoes, so that in times of disagreement we might consider for a moment that there might be another, better way that makes all of us stronger. \u2022 Teamwork: It sets ego aside and demands that we all pull in the same direction to win. \u2022 Faith: It tells us we are made special in the image of God with unique gifts that enable our mission here on earth. These values allow us to develop policy solutions that solve problems in new and creative ways for the good of all Americans instead of producing rhetoric, sound bites and press releases that too often pass for true reform. In Ohio we've implemented this winning strategy. It's worked there, and it will work for the nation as well.", "hypo": ["Sen. Rob Portman: Is America a nation divided?

Administration officials as high up the rung as the president himself last week made calls to more than 130 federal lawmakers, urging them to support the deal Secretary of State John Kerry negotiated with Iran, and, at the very least, not to meddle in foreign affairs. The president's spokesman said a two-week break in congressional activity has meant 'that we have not been able to have as many face-to-face conversations as we would like - but that's going to change today.' . With the newly returned lawmakers scheduled to tomorrow take the first in a series of votes setting the perimeters for a deal, the White House said administration officials would hold classified briefings with Members of Congress aimed at 'helping' them understand 'commitments Iran has made so far, and how those commitments we hope will be finalized hopefully in the next two months.' Scroll down for video . President Barack Obama sits with National Security Adviser Susan Rice, left, and Energy Secretary Dr. Ernest Moniz at the start the summit with Caribbean Community last Thursday in Kingston, Jamaica. The trio, along with Secretary of State John Kerry and senior members of the intelligence community are this week lobbying Members of Congress and Jewish community leaders to support the nuclear pact with Iran. OPPOSITION: Senate Foreign Affairs Chairman Bob Corker, pictured here last Friday at the National Rifle Association's annual conference, is whipping support for a bill that would give Congress a say on a potential deal aimed at keeping Tehran from developing a nuclear weapon. The White House 'strongly' opposes it. A Senate panel is set to vote tomorrow on an intensely debated bill authored by Senate Foreign Affairs Chairman Bob Corker that would give Congress a say on a potential deal aimed at keeping Tehran from developing a nuclear weapon. On the House side, Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said today that he will bring the bill to the floor if the Senate acts on legislation giving Congress the power to review any deal. 'It's my intention to bring it to the floor of the House and move it,' McCarthy said at a news conference as Congress was returning from its spring break. Republicans and Democrats maintain that Congress should have a say on an international deal with Tehran to curb its nuclear program and have lined up behind legislation. . The White House has pushed back, threatening a presidential veto while warning that the bill could scuttle the delicate talks involving the United States, Iran and five world powers. 'Lines in the sands have moved back,' McCarthy said, claiming the U.S. has back-tracked on some of the demands it had at the beginning of the talks. . 'A lot of the questions will be why have they moved back and will Iran ever be able to have the capability of having a nuclear weapon? That's a key question.' Under the bill, Obama could unilaterally lift or ease any sanctions that were imposed on Iran through presidential executive means. . But it would prohibit him for 60 days from suspending, waiving or otherwise easing any sanctions that Congress levied on Iran. During that 60-day period, Congress could hold hearings and approve, disapprove or take no action on any final nuclear agreement with Iran. If Congress passed a joint resolution approving a final deal \u2014 or took no action \u2014 Obama could move ahead to ease sanctions levied by Congress. . FIRST STOP: Energy Secretary Moniz, who was a key negotiator in the Iran nuclear deal, speaks to reporters in the White House briefing room last week. This week administration officials, including Moniz, are holding classified briefings with Members of Congress aimed at 'helping' them understand 'commitments Iran has made so far, and how those commitments we hope will be finalized hopefully in the next two months' On the other hand, if Congress passed a joint resolution disapproving it, Obama would be blocked from providing Iran with any relief from congressional sanctions. The White House has said the president will 'absolutely' veto the Corker legislation if it comes to his desk not just because it would allow Congress to thrust itself into the deal-making process but also because it would require Iran to renounce its terrorist activities. Such a requirement would set up an unreasonable expectation that Iran would neither honor nor agree to, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest has argued, and could push Tehran to further embrace radical elements. 'The way the legislation is currently written is something that we strongly oppose,' Earnest said today. 'But, again, we continue to have extensive conversations with members of Congress on Capitol Hill.' He later accused members of having their 'priorities backward' and took a shot at House Republicans' ability to whip votes. After a reporter asked him about McCarthy's claim that he is close to achieving a veto-proof majority of support for the bill in the House, Earnest said, 'It's his responsibility to count votes,' then snarked, 'I don't think anybody's battin' 1000 when it comes to countin votes up there.' Secretary of State John Kerry postponed a foreign trip to meet with members of the House to discuss the negotiations. . Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew and senior officials in the intelligence community were also holding classified briefings Monday and Tuesday with members of the House and Senate. Earnest said some Republicans are 'rigidly partisan' and will reject any deal just because President Barack Obama supports it. . And while he acknowledged there is some Democratic opposition, administration officials will continue to talk with members of his party, he said. . 'I think there are some Democrats who will listen to this pitch,' Earnest said. 'I don't know if it will convince them all, but there is a strong case to make and it's one that we intend to continue making.'

They scored with their first shot on target in the 70th minute, well worth the wait when Yann Kermorgant hit a wonderful 25-yard free-kick which wrong-footed Brighton goalkeeper David Stockdale and flew into the left of goal. . With only their second accurate effort, in the 81st minute, Callum Wilson extended their lead by running on to Kermorgant\u2019s ball over the top and twice turned Greg Halford before finishing. .

In doing so they set a club record 106 goals in all competitions, beating 104 from the 1956-57 and 1928-29 seasons. And Wilson\u2019s strike was their 89th league goal of the season, moving clear of the previous record 88 they scored in the Division Three South in the 1956-57 season. Prior to the goals they had not looked like the typically fluent Bournemouth that has made them league leaders for the majority of the campaign. The passes were hit that little bit too long, the crosses went out for goal kicks and the through balls were slightly mistimed. Brighton\u2019s Leon Best got in behind their defence in the 58th minute and shaped to bend an effort into the right of goal but his shot was woeful, weak and straight at Artur Boruc. . Four minutes later, Mustafa Carayol made a driving run through the middle and got a powerful shot away from the edge of the box but Bournemouth captain Tommy Elphick dived in front to block. But Bournemouth showed they can win ugly and when the game is not going their way, as well as dominating teams with their passing. Howe is well aware that nerves will come into play with his players as they battle for promotion to the Premier League for the first time in their history. Yet his side are starting to demonstrate that they can handle the pressure. Four more games remain, against Reading, Sheffield Wednesday, Bolton and Charlton - a run of fixtures which they should deal with comfortably.

With temperatures dropping to as low as eight degree Celsius, Senior Sergeant Ralph Willingham believes that the fourth day of searching will have a further level of urgency. 'The advice I'm getting from our search and rescue experts having regard to the overnight temperatures and the daytime temperatures is that he could well still be out there,' he said.

Natalie Prescott, 26, was not expected to survive after she dived into a quarry in a dare-devil stunt which went horribly wrong. Her family was warned she was unlikely to pull through and that if she did, she would almost certainly lose her legs. Mum-of-three Natalie Prescott, 26, with Harley, 5, (left), 19 month old Scarlett, and Saskia, 7, (right), nearly lost her legs after leaping off Appley Bridge Quarry, near Wigan, back in 2012. Through perseverance, she is finally on the way to recovery \u2013 and says her children are her inspiration. But after learning that a teenage boy tragically drowned in the same quarry on Friday, Natalie is campaigning to have the area closed off to the public. Mother-of-three Natalie, from Wigan, said: 'This tragedy brought it all back to me. I almost died there too \u2013 and I want all young people to learn from my stupidity - please stay away from lakes and rivers because tomb-stoning can kill you. 'But in a way, I'm glad it happened to me, because it taught me what's important in life. All that matters to me now are my three lovely children.' After the incident, it was revealed that her ankles were pulverised and her knee cap was smashed. She had several operations during a three-month hospital stay, including metal plating in her ankle. The accident, in June 2012, happened at Appley Bridge quarry, Wigan, near the farm owned by Natalie's mother, Susan. . Susan was later to see the air ambulance over her farm \u2013 unaware it was carrying her own daughter. Natalie, who is mother to Saskia, 7, Harley, 5, and 19 month old Scarlett, says: 'I hooked up with some old friends and on a sunny afternoon we went for a day out to a beauty spot, where rocks overhang a disused quarry. 'My mum lived nearby and she was looking after my two children whilst I went out with my friends. 'We were daring each other to jump in the water, and even though I knew it was stupid, I went along with it. I had never done anything like that before. 'I just fancied doing something crazy. I wasn't thinking about my children, I was thinking about myself.' As Natalie jumped, her nerves got the better of her and she hesitated. She smashed against an overhanging cliff, before hitting the water. After the accident, although the doctors managed to save her legs, she was unable to walk or stand, and had to learn all over again. At the time of the accident in 2012, the 26-year-old had two children, Saskia, now 7, and Harley, now 5. She says: 'As I hit the water, I saw a large gaping hole in my knee. I had no pain but I was shaking and in shock.' Natalie's friends dragged her onto the banking and gave her mouth to mouth resuscitation as she began to struggle with her breathing. Unconscious, she was flown to hospital by a mountain rescue team and placed in ICU. Natalie says: 'My mum and my children saw the air ambulance land near their farm, and they watched it \u2013 unaware that it was me who was injured.' Her family was at first warned she might not survive \u2013 and were then told she would lose both of her legs. Natalie says: 'My memories of those first days in hospital were very hazy. . 'I was in so much pain and my legs were just a mush. My knee cap was smashed and my ankles were pulverised.' In August 2013, Natalie gave birth to her third child, Scarlett, now 19 months. The mum-of-three has stated that her children have been her inspiration for recovering from the horrific incident. Before and after: Natalie finally took her first steps one year after the accident, and then gave birth to her new baby, Scarlett in August 2013. She had several operations during a three month hospital stay, including surgery to fit metal plating in her ankle and an artificial knee joint. . Though doctors managed to save her legs, she was left unable to walk or stand. She was transferred to rehab, where she began to learn to walk again. Natalie said: 'It was a very low point for me. I felt so guilty that I had put my family through so much pain and worry. 'Every time my children visited me in hospital, they would cry and beg me to come home. 'My son, Harley, said to me: 'Get out of that big pram mummy and start walking again.' 'It was very painful and so frustrating, but I just had to work hard, every day, to get myself well again.' Natalie finally took her first steps one year after the accident. And in August 2013, she gave birth to a new baby, Scarlett. Natalie says: 'Scarlett's birth really inspired me to get back on my feet. I had to get better, because I had a new baby to look after. 'I feel like I'm back to being a mummy again': Although Natalie still has a limp and isn't able to ride horses, she can look after her children better. 26-year-old Natalie is now better able to care for her children, including Saskia, now 7, and younger brother Harley, now 5. She has vowed to start a petition to have the area closed to public after hearing of the drowning of teenager Miracle Godson. 'I was determined to look after her on my own because I've needed so much help with my older children. 'I feel like I'm back to being a mummy again, and that is such a precious role and one I won't take for granted ever again. 'I won't ever be back to how I was; I have a limp and I can't walk far. I won't ever be able to ride horses again. 'But in a way, I'm grateful for the accident.

Depsite being a toyboy, Taylor-Johnson says friends liken him to Brad Pitt's character in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, in which Pitt ages in reverse. A recent Instagram image shows the couple clearly in love six years after they first met. In an interview in Saturday's Times magazine the co-star of the latest installment of Disney's superhero blockbuster Avengers: Age of Ultron says: 'I don't notice it now - we just instinctively gel ... People who know me call me Benjamin Button - they think I'm an old soul and she's a young soul.' Taylor-Johnson says he fell in love with Sam, the most commercially successful female film-maker in history after she directed Fifty Shades of Grey, which was released in February, on the first day they met on the set of Nowhere Boy in 2009. After a whirlwind romance, the pair announced their engagement at the film's premiere later that year. They married at Babington House in Somerset when Taylor-Johnson was 20, a move he says made 'perfect sense'. He tells the magazine: 'I knew I wanted to be with her. I wanted kids, we had kids and I was really into that, taking time off and involving myself in the bubble of her pregnancy.'

The couple's first daughter, Wylda Rae, was born in July 2010 followed by Romy Hero in January 2012. . The family now lives in Los Angeles with Sam's daughters Angelica, 17, and Jessie Phoenix, eight, from her first marriage to the art dealer Jay Jopling, and the couple take on one project a year each so one parent is always at home. Aaron, who grew up in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, has been acting since the age of six when he starred in a Persil advert. . When he was 12 he appeared in Hollywood action comedy Shaghai Knights, and when he was 15 he worked alongside Edward Norton in The Illusionist. Taylor-Johnson says he was a 'self destructive teenager struggling with success' before he met Sam. . But after the two got together, she quickly became his best friend and a stable influence in the notoriously fickle Hollywood. . He and Sam now focus most of their time on being parents, with school runs and extracurricular activities taking up the bulk of their days. . They have a rule that they are only allowed to take on one project a year, meaning that someone is always around for the children. . And although looking after four children at the age of 24 might seem like a hard task, Taylor-Johnson says he has never been happier. . He told the newspaper: 'Being a father has been the happiest time of my life - it's what I live for, what I love doing - I have a real reason why I'm here, I'm not as proud of my acting; it's a job that I do ... I'm grateful, but I don't live for acting.'", "hypo": ["Aaron Taylor-Johnson was just 19 when he met wife Sam, then 42, on the set of Nowhere Boy in 2009 in which he played the young John Lennon.", "Aaron Taylor-Johnson was just 19 when he met wife Sam, then 42, on the set of Nowhere Boy in 2009 in which he played the young John Lennon.

'We're expecting!' the 22-year-old 19 Kids & Counting star announced on Tuesday. Excited for the arrival: The TLC stars also shared this image that had written on a white onesie, 'Coming soon, 11.01.2015' Something in the water! Soon after the announcement was made, Anna Duggar (middle) shared an image of Jessa (right) showing off her bump in a Twitter photo. Also in the snap is Jill (far left), who was still with child at the time the photograph was taken. A big hint: The announcement does not come as too much of a surprise to fans as in late March an image of the two was uploaded to Facebook that suggested they could be expecting - Ben was holding his wife's stomach in a pose typically struck by couples who are about to share they're planning for a little one. Jessa's baby will be the sixth grandchild for the Duggars. She is the third child to marry, and every marriage has resulted in a baby the first year of marriage. The youngest of Jim Bob and Michelle's children, Josie, seen here in Jim Bob's lap, is younger than their eldest granddaughter Mackynzie, who is seated in the front row. Soon after the announcement was made, Anna Duggar shared an image of Jessa showing off her bump in a Twitter photo. Also in the snap is Jill, who was still with child at the time the photograph was taken. 'Congrats @JessaSeewald @BenSeewald on your pregnancy! It was great to be pregnant together @jillmdillard,' she wrote in the caption. Anna, who is married to eldest Duggar Josh, is pregnant with the couple's fourth child, a baby girl due in July. The couple, who married in 2008 after a chaste courtship, already have Mackynzie, Michael and Marcus. . Josh works for the Family Research Council, a pro life, anti gay marriage Christian lobbying organization in Washington DC. . The whole family is famously prolife and shuns birth control. Michelle stopped taking birth control after she miscarried early in her marriage. She had gone on the pill following eldest child Josh's birth. Then she miscarried while taking birth control, she has said. . Michelle then went off birth control and soon welcomed fraternal twins - and never used birth control again. Now Michelle and all her children proclaim that God does their family planning and they share their prolife beliefs on social media and the show. And lots of kids isn't all he shares with his parents. He and Anna also seems to be continuing a tradition with naming, as all 19 Duggar children have names that start with J, and his three children all have M names. . Josh shared this photo of his pregnant wife and three children at the airport a few days ago. His eldest child is older than his youngest sister. The whole family is outspokenly pro-life, and josh and Anna are seen here kneeling when attending a rally earlier this year. Josh now works for the Family Research Council, a conservative prolife group. Josh shared this photo of his wife and younger brother Joseph for Joseph's birthday - wearing anti Roe v Wade t-shirts for the occasion. Jill, the fourth eldest Duggar, welcomed son Israel David earlier this month, ten months after her wedding. And now the fertility streak is continuing with daughter Jessa and her husband Ben. . 'We are looking forward to being parents,' Ben told People on Tuesday. 'I am feeling pretty good,' added Jessa. 'The morning sickness was different every day. It's getting better, but I'm still hanging on to the heartburn. And I don't have any super serious food cravings.' The announcement does not come as too much of a surprise to fans as in late March an image of the two was uploaded to Facebook that suggested they could be expecting. Ben was holding his wife's stomach in a pose typically struck by couples who are about to share the good news that they're planning for a little one. The picture, in which the newlyweds are smiling and making the shape of a heart with their hands on Jessa's stomach, sparked rumors online of an impending pregnancy. Anna, left, got to be pregnant with Jill, right, for this her fourth pregnancy. The pair posed for this photo earlier this year, before Jessa's pregnancy was public . Flashback! For her first pregnancy, Anna and her mother-in-law Michelle were pregnant at the same time. Making babies! They shared their passion online and the lovebirds in a romantic kiss after they married. They saved the first kiss for their wedding day and only held hands when they got engaged. Hiding her tummy: On Sunday the Duggar daughter shared this image to Instagram with the caption, 'Headed to Big Sandy, TX to meet up with my family!' The two did not make any kind of statement at the time. In her People interview, the TLC star explained that she found out she was with child when she took a pregnancy test one Sunday morning before church. . 'I said, \"Hey Ben, guess what? Yeah, you're a dad.\" We couldn't believe it,' the daughter of Jim Bob, 49, and Michelle Duggar, 48. She added, 'We are so excited. We have started talking baby names. It is one of those things that is so special, picking a name for a baby.' . It runs in the family: Jessa's older sister Jill Dillard, 23, and her husband, Derick, 26, welcomed son Israel David on April 6 after a 70-hour labor .

In Erik Compton's case, make that plural: hearts. He'll tee off this week at the Masters on his third. The 35-year-old veteran would rather be known for his golf than what he's had to overcome to earn a spot in the field. But Compton isn't shy about sharing his story, either. Erik Compton shares a joke with Jim Furyk during a practice round at Augusta ahead of the Masters. A first heart transplant at 12, then a second in 2008 after a major heart attack - what doctors call a 'widow-maker' - while driving home from a lesson with longtime coach and close pal Charlie DeLucca. He's been trying make up for lost time ever since. 'It's hard, but it's also a great thing,' Compton said on Monday after a practice round at Augusta National. . 'There's two sides to me. I'm a competitor and a sports person, and I'm also the recipient of two transplants, and I know what that involves. So when you put them together, it does make a little bit of spaghetti in my mind sometimes you know.' . 'I'll take it,' he added a moment later. It's not like Compton had a choice. He recovered from his childhood setback to become the No 1-ranked junior in the United States at 18, then a two-time All-American at Georgia. . Compton, 35, is set to make his first appearance at the famous tournament this week. But he's spent most of the intervening years battling on minor league circuits, then becoming an advocate and spokesman for Donate Life, an alliance for national and local groups raising awareness about organ and tissue donation. In a nice bit of serendipity, his first appearance in the Masters coincides with Donate Life Month. . But it's already a full-time campaign for Compton - he's been displaying the organization's logo on his shirt sleeve for a while. All of those efforts paid big dividends last year, when he carved out a spot on the PGA Tour and nearly stole the show at the US Open. His runner-up finish at Pinehurst nudged Compton and his story into the spotlight - and earned him an invitation to Augusta. It was something he'd longed to do since watching the tournament on TV as a kid. 'For me, it was a bit difficult to watch so many years and think, I'm never going to play in the Masters, just because of other issues that I've had. But yet, I just love to watch the Masters. So it's going to be weird,' he said to laughter, 'not watching the Masters this year.' Compton's wife, Barbara, and parents Peter and Eli won't be tuning in this year, either, making the drive up from Florida to watch Erik play in person. It's a well-deserved reward to be sure, since all of them had a hand in the push-pull climb toward the top of the golf hill. The veteran has had two heart transplants, but wants to focus on the week ahead, rather than his journey. After walking most his son's practice round, Peter Compton recalled how motivated Erik was, no matter how tough things seemed. Six months after Hurricane Andrew hit the Miami area in 1992, forcing the family out of their home and into temporary housing alongside a golf course near Doral, he took his son to play a few holes. 'We were in a cart and back then, he liked driving more than playing,' Peter recalled. 'But every time we'd leave the tee, he'd drive to his ball, and he was already hitting it 225 (yards) or so. So finally, about the third time it happened, I had to remind him, \"Hey, stop here. Let me play MY tee shots!\" 'He started playing junior tournaments in the area after that and a lot of the fathers would come up and tell me what a terrific story it was,' Peter said. . 'But it wasn't long after that Erik started winning those tournaments. ... He could have sat back, said he'd been dealt a bad hand and did nothing. So I think that's what we're most proud of - he refused to give up.' Compton chats with his caddie as he walks the famous course ahead of his first ever round at the Masters. Compton tries to strike a delicate balance between those accomplishments and his aspirations. After a promising 2014 campaign on the big tour, his breakthrough performance at Pinehurst - only the second major he qualified to play. . But Compton struggled this year, opening the 2015 season with a tie for 10th. He then wrestled with his driver and missed the cut in his next five tournaments. At the moment, most of his energy and focus are devoted to keeping the ball in play. 'I'm here in the press room at the Masters, and that's a great thing,' he said. 'But I don't look at myself as somebody who is a role model ... I look at myself as a golfer who has used golf as a means to maybe put some of the tough stuff that's happened to me in the past. Golf's been very therapeutic for me over the years. 'As I'm sitting here today,' Compton concluded, 'I view myself as somebody who is going to try to do the best he can to compete in the Masters.' .", "hypo": ["Erik Compton has had two heart transplants in his life.

The latest discovery of cremated human bones packed neatly into a cooking pot and set off at the side of the historic River Walbrook, in London, has experts questioning whether they were part of a gruesome ceremony. When about 20 skulls were found buried in clusters in the sediment of the historic tributary in 2013 it had been thought that they had got there down stream after being eroded out of a Roman cemetery to the north - but new evidence suggests otherwise. Scroll down for video . New find: Around seven human skulls (pictured) dating back nearly 2,000 years have so far been found as part of the latest discovery by archaeologists at the London Crossrail site near Liverpool Street station. Roman rummaging: One of the skulls (left) was uncovered next to a Roman road which has also been found. A piece of Roman figurative pottery (right) was also dug up during searches of the site. Digging for history: A cross-section of the Roman roadside ditch uncovered at Liverpool Street station. The estimated age of the human remains and the way they appear to have been disposed of has led to the suggestion that the bones could even be Boudicca's rebels. Scientific tests are continuing on the cremated remains, with the possibility the grim ritual theory may be confirmed and that most of the seven skulls found so far are heads of executed criminals and rebels. A spokesman for London Crossrail confirmed the team was working up a number of theories. He said: 'We don't have any answers yet but we are looking into it.' .

Revolt: Boudicca was Queen of the Iceni people, a British tribe who tried to defeat the Roman army. The Boudiccan Revolt raged from 60-61AD and saw British tribes, under Boudicca of the Iceni, unsuccessfully try to defeat the Roman army. Boudicca was Queen of the Iceni people, a British tribe who lived in what is today Norfolk and parts of Suffolk and Cambridgeshire. Her name is an early for of the more commonly known name 'Victoria'. Her husband, Prasutagus, was ruler of the Iceni people, and the Romans allowed Prasutagus to continue as king, ruling on their behalf. But, when Prasutagus died, the Romans decided to rule the Iceni directly and they confiscated the property of the leading Iceni families. The Romans are also said to have stripped and whipped Boudicca, and raped her daughters. The revolt resulted in Camulodunum, now Colchester, London, and Verulamium, now St Albans, being burnt to the ground while thousands of people on both sides lost their lives. Colchester was the first target of the Boudiccan army and many of the townspeople were rounded up and sacrificed in nearby groves. The Crossrail team spokesman said a connection was not currently being made between the skulls from 2,000 years ago and Boudicca's rebels but the possibility has not been ruled out. Work to excavate 3,000 skeletons from Bedlam burial ground, at the site of the new Liverpool Street station that will serve the cross-London rail network, has now been completed. It took a team of 60 archaeologists four weeks, working six days a week, to remove the remains and record evidence for what may prove to be, in archaeological terms, London's most valuable 16th and 17th Century cemetery site. Among the skeletons discovered at the burial site - used from 1569 until at least 1738, including the Great Plague in 1665 - were a mother a her child buried side-by-side. They have now been transferred to the Museum of London Archaeology (MOLA).

A new app makes creating the images simple on a smartphone - and lets you send them using Facebook Messenger. Camoji is one of the first apps to take advantage of Facebook's decision to open up Messenger, revealed at its recent f8 conference in San Francisco. . Camoji allows people to add Instagram style filters to their images before sharing them. The GIFs are created in the Camoji app. . Once downloaded, users simply tap on the shutter icon to record an animated gif that is up to 2 seconds long. . They can then add filters and other effects - similar to Instagram. . Camoji lets you record a GIF with unique filters and text and share it to your friends on Messenger, where GIFs animate inline in the conversation. The GIFs are created in the Camoji app. . People that have Camoji installed see a Reply button that launches Camoji right from the Messenger conversation so they can quickly record and send a GIF of their own. This type of back and forth is exactly what makes the entire experience beautiful and seamless. 'App discovery is a major challenge for developers,' said Carlos Whitt, Camoji CEO. 'Messenger is opening the door for developers to create innovative new ways for people to connect and express themselves without having to reinvent the social plumbing. . 'This is a monumental development.' 'We're excited to have worked with the Messenger team to help people share by easily capturing moments and sharing them seamlessly within Messenger,' said Austin Broyles, Camoji co-founder. 'We feel our integration is truly unique and innovative.' This is the first time the world's biggest social network has opened their Messenger app to seamless integration with third parties, and this level of integration does not exist on other messenger apps. . Camoji had previously integrated with iMessage and WhatsApp, but those integrations lacked a way for recipients to easily download Camoji or launch it from a conversation to reply with another GIF. Camoji lets you record a GIF with unique filters and text and share it to your friends on Messenger. Earlier this month Facebook opened up its Messenger service for developers to create apps and for consumers to communicate directly with retailers, in the social media network's latest effort to expand its reach. The firm hopes to transform Facebook's messaging service into one that operates independently of the company's social media network, effectively pitting it against traditional email. It even revealed it will allow smart devices such as doors and home appliances to use the platform. . It comes as it faces intensifying competition from Twitter and Google, as well as from fast-growing messaging apps such as Snapchat and WeChat. Facebook unveiled the new features at its annual developer conference in San Francisco, for the first time allowing developers to create apps that function inside the Messenger app, which has more than 600 million users. Forty different apps will be available on Messenger in the coming days, allowing users of the service to send each other sports clips and animations, Facebook said. Users can add text and other effects to their gifs before posting them. Another feature will allow consumers to use Messenger to send a text message to make a restaurant reservation or to receive a notification that a product purchased online has shipped. 'One of the fastest growing and most important members of our family is Messenger,' said Mr Zuckerberg. 'Facebook used to be this single blue app and it did a lot of different things, now Facebook is a family of apps,' he said. . 'Moving from being a single service to a family of apps is the biggest shift we've made in our strategy in helping connect people.'

In Britain we so enjoy the spiced, sweet rolls with a cross on top, that they used to be eaten all year round. That was until Queen Elizabeth I tried to ban them, possibly finding the cross a little too Catholic. The move was greeted with uproar, so she compromised, saying they could only be sold on Good Friday, at Christmas and for burials \u2014 and they have been prime Easter fare ever since. Nowadays supermarkets bring out ever more permutations to tempt customers, from miniature sizes to new flavours like toffee fudge chunk and apple and cinnamon. Here is best of the batch this Easter. Harriet Arkell (pictured) has tested out the best hot cross buns on offer this Easter. ELEVENSES TREAT. Tesco Finest Apple & Cinnamon Hot Cross Buns, \u00a31.50 for four. Nutrition: 198 cals, 11.5g sugar, 0.4g salt, 33.7g carbs, 3.2g fat. These looked lovely and squidgy but weren\u2019t big on flavour, sadly. Nice, but slightly bland. 3/5. PRETTIEST. Selfridges Hot Cross Buns, \u00a34.99 for four. Nutrition: No details available. Four lovely, fat buns that look very attractive. They went a pretty shade of gold when heated and were delicious with some butter and strawberry jam. Made for Selfridges by the St John bakery in Bermondsey, South London, they\u2019re expensive, but worth it (though I wouldn\u2019t have minded just a tad more fruit). 4/5. MOST INDULGENT. M&S Toffee Fudge & Belgian Chocolate Hot Cross Buns, \u00a31.60 for four. Nutrition per bun: 207 calories, 11.8g sugar, 0.35g salt, 33.5g carbs, 5.4g fat. What looks like traditional raisins in these sticky buns is actually a generous serving of toffee, fudge and dark chocolate chips. I wanted to find these too sweet, but they were delicious. 5/5. POSHEST. Fortnum & Mason Sir Nigel\u2019s Marmalade Hot Cross Buns, \u00a35.95 for four. Nutrition: 320 cals, 17.2g sugar, 0.36g salt, 59.3g carbs, 6g fat. BIG, fat, golden buns with the traditional white cross and a glaze of orange marmalade. Slightly bitter, but in a good way! Toasted, they are utter perfection. 5/5. MOST ECCENTRIC. Heston From Waitrose Ginger & Acacia Honey Hot Cross Buns, \u00a31.50 for two. Nutrition: 255 cals, 23.8g sugar, 0.5g salt, 46.9g carbs, 4g fat. These big buns have a refreshing hit of ginger and a lovely sweet slick of honey. Perfect with a cup of Earl Grey, though they might scare traditional types. 4/5. NUTTY BUT NICE. Waitrose Nutty & Flavoursome Muesli Hot Cross Buns, \u00a31.69 for four. Nutrition: 194 cals, 15.3g sugar, 0.37g salt, 30.7g carbs, 4.3g fat. Stuffed with vine fruits, hazelnuts and rolled oats, so they have a very different texture to regular hot cross buns. Slightly chewy, they\u2019re more substantial than the others, but would be nice for breakfast with a little bit of honey. 4/5. SHOWSTOPPER. Betty\u2019s of Harrogate Large Chocolate & Orange Hot Cross Bun, \u00a36.25 for one. Nutrition: No details available. This legendary Harrogate bakery never fails to disappoint. This bun is very large (nearly 6in diameter) so you may want to slice, toast and share it. With chunks of dark chocolate chunks and pieces of crystallised orange peel, it\u2019s the ultimate Easter treat. 5/5. BEST FOR KIDS. Morrisons Chocolate Hot Cross Buns, 99p for six. Nutrition: 151 cals, 7.9g sugar, 0.3g salt, 22.7g carbs, 5g fat. Smaller than average and absolutely stuffed with big chocolate chunks. They are delicious cold, and fantastic heated up. 5/5. BUDGET BUY. Lidl Rowan Hill Bakery Luxury Hot Cross Buns, 99p for four. Nutrition: 197 cals, 14g sugar, 0.35g salt, 34g carbs, 3.4g fat. well-stuffed with fruit but a little dense for my liking. Still, there\u2019s no arguing with the price and they brush up well after a few minutes in the oven and with some melted butter and jam. 3/5. CALORIE BUSTER.

Sticky, milk and white chocolate-stuffed buns that sound like a pudding but work as a bun. Put your feet up and indulge! 5/5. FREE FROM NASTIES. Waitrose LOVELife Free From Hot Cross Buns, \u00a32.49 for four. Nutrition: 204 cals, 13.4g sugars, 0.33g salt, 34.8g carbs, 5.4g fat. Free from gluten, these are still beautifully spiced and the nicest of the free-from varieties I tried. 4/5. GRANNY'S CHOICE. Sainsbury\u2019s Taste The Difference Cranberry & Golden Raisin Hot Cross Buns, \u00a31.70 for four. Nutrition: 203 cals, 18.1g sugar, 0.47g salt, 36.5g carbs, 3.4g fat. They look pretty, with jewel-like cranberries and fat golden raisins. Though, if I\u2019m being really fussy, they\u2019re slightly dry so need a big dollop of butter. 4/5. GUILT-FREE. Waitrose Richly Fruited Mini Hot Cross Buns, \u00a31.59 for nine. Nutrition: 88 cals, 7.5g sugar, 0.18g salt, 16.1g carbs, 1.4g fat.

M&S Luxury Hot Cross Buns, \u00a31.60 for four. Nutrition: 209 cals, 19.5g sugar, 0.33g salt, 40.4g carbs, 2.4g fat. M&S are rather good at doing seasonal treats like this, and their luxury offering this year is no exception. These are neither too light nor too dense, come packed with juicy fruit and orange and lemon peel and have a fab flavour. 5/5. .", "hypo": ["In Britain we so enjoy the spiced, sweet rolls with a cross on top.

Alexander Pacteau, 21, allegedly killed the nursing student, whose disappearance sparked a huge police search earlier this week. He is also charged with attempting to defeat the ends of justice, it emerged at a private court appearance today at Glasgow Sheriff Court. A man has been charged with murder after the body of nursing student Karen Buckley was found this week. A security van arrives at Glasgow Sheriff Court ahead of a court appearance by Alexander Pacteau, the 21-year-old charged with Miss Buckley's murder and attempting to defeat the ends of justice. Pacteau, from the city's west end, made no plea or declaration and was remanded in custody by sheriff Charles McFarlane QC. He will appear again next week for a full committal hearing. Miss Buckley, a qualified nurse, went missing following a night out at the Sanctuary nightclub in Glasgow on Saturday night. Her body was later found by police at a farm six miles north of the city. A spokesman for Scotland's Crown Office said: 'Alexander Pacteau, 21, from Glasgow, appeared at Glasgow Sheriff Court today charged with the murder of Karen Buckley, and with attempting to defeat the ends of justice. 'He made no plea or declaration and was remanded in custody. It is anticipated he will appear again next week for a further hearing. 'It would be inappropriate to comment further at this stage in proceedings.' Pacteau made no plea at the court (pictured) today and was remanded in custody until next week. Miss Buckley's body was found on a farm six miles north of her home in the city earlier this week. A huge police search was launched after her disappearance, which ended at High Craigton farm. Friends of Miss Buckley raised the alarm on Sunday morning when she failed to return from a night out at the nightclub. The search led police to Dawsholm Park, where Miss Buckley's handbag was found on Tuesday, and a nearby property, before the farm where the discovery was made. Ms Buckley moved to Scotland in February and was a first-year occupational therapy student at Glasgow Caledonian University. Her family, who travelled to Scotland on Tuesday, have said they are 'absolutely heartbroken'. Her father, John Buckley, 62, said she was an outgoing girl who 'thoroughly enjoyed life'. He released a statement through Police Scotland yesterday which read: 'Marian and I, together with our sons Brendan, Kieran, and Damian, are absolutely heartbroken. 'Karen was our only daughter, cherished by her family and loved by her friends. 'She was an outgoing girl who travelled the world, where she met lots of people and thoroughly enjoyed her life. We will miss her terribly.' Miss Buckley, pictured with her brothers Brendan, Damien and Kieran, has been described as an 'outgoing girl' who was always 'smiling' Miss Buckley (pictured left on the night of her disappearance) only moved to Glasgow two months ago. Her parents, John and Marian, say they are 'absolutely heartbroken' at the death of their 'cherished' daughter. Flowers, cards and pictures have been left at the entrance to the farm and at Glasgow Caledonian University in tribute to Miss Buckley. A vigil will be held in George Square in Glasgow city centre this evening to show support for the family and friends of the student, who was from Cork in the Irish Republic. People are being encouraged to bring flowers and candles to the event. The outpouring of support for the family has also raised \u00a350,000 in an online drive organised by her former classmates at Limerick University. The Go Fund Me page was set up to cover the family's travel and expenses while in Scotland and to support the upkeep of their farm in Cork. It raised more than 10 times the original target amount.

Clinton, whose mother Hillary is expected to formally announce her presidential campaign this Sunday, said it is time the United States had a female leader. 'One of our core values in this country is that we are the land of equal opportunity, but when equal hasn't yet included gender, there is a fundamental challenge there that, I believe, having our first woman president\u2014whenever that is\u2014will help resolve,' said Clinton.

Chelsea Clinton has come a long way from being the adolescent that grew up in front of our eyes while her dad was POTUS. Yes, Chelsea is now a mom, wife, and advocate for women. Being the daughter of two of the most influential people on the planet doesn't seem to faze Chelsea. She gave a candid interview to Elle magazine this month about motherhood and talks of how her own mom should be the first female president of the United States.

'I now understand all of the enthusiastic, bombastically spectacular, wonderful things people say about their children,' says Clinton of her daughter (Above with her family shortly after the birth) In the interview with Elle, Clinton does not however say too much about her mother's campaign plans, and focuses instead on the general lack of female representation in politics. 'We've made real progress on legal protections for women, but in no way are women at parity to men in our country in the workplace,' she explains. 'And if we look in the political sphere, it is challenging to me that women comprising 20 percent of Congress is treated as a real success. Since when did 20 percent become the definition of equality?' She then adds; 'And so when you ask about the importance of having a woman president, absolutely it's important, for, yes, symbolic reasons\u2014symbols are important; it is important who and what we choose to elevate, and to celebrate.' Clinton, who looks almost unrecognizable in the accompanying fashion spread, also talks about life with daughter Charlotte. . Clinton says that though the US is the 'land of equal opportunity,' that is not true about gender, and a female president would change that. Hillary and Chelsea Clinton in a photo taken shortly after her birth in 1980. 'I now understand\u2014this is something else that Marc and I talk about all the time\u2014all of the enthusiastic, bombastically spectacular, wonderful things people say about their children, because we also feel and think all those things about Charlotte,' said Clinton. And now, almost 25 years after she first hit the campaign trail as a child, Clinton seems ready to do it all over again, as the 35-year-old may once again return to the role of first daughter. . Elle's editor-in-chief Robbie Myers is certainly excited about this prospect, describing Clinton as 'innately regal' in her editor's letter. 'She\u2019s a person of substance for sure, a young woman who, while measured in her manner, has a fierceness of conviction, and a calling to make the world a better place,' says Myers. Clinton meanwhile is focused on seeing that first female president. 'Yes, we've seen again and again, when women have been in positions of leadership, they have had different degrees of success versus their male counterparts, historically being able to build more consensus so that decisions have longer-term effects, whether in economic investments or in building social capital,' says Clinton. .

Cardiff-based Proton Partners International Ltd, is to open the treatment centres, which will be available to NHS cancer patients, in Cardiff, London and Northumberland by 2017, with the first in the Welsh capital being operational by next year. The announcement comes just weeks after the parents of brain cancer sufferer Ashya told of how he was given the 'all-clear' after receiving proton bean therapy at a centre in Prague. Scroll down for video . Five-year-old Ashya King, pictured in October, who suffered from brain cancer but has recently been given the all-clear after receiving proton beam therapy . Three centres in the UK in Cardiff, London and Northumberland, are set to open offering proton beam therapy, which Ashya, pictured, received. Both Brett and Naghmeh King sparked an international manhunt last year after taking their son out of hospital in Southampton, without doctors' consent. Mr and Mrs King had wanted their son to have the cutting-edge therapy instead of conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Fearing that Ashya would be taken away from them and given the treatment, the family fled to Spain before travelling to the Czech Republic to the Proton Therapy Centre. Now, a group called Proton Partners International has now been formed in the UK following discussions between Professor Sir Chris Evans, the life sciences entrepreneur and UK life sciences and healthcare investors. They have committed almost \u00a3100million equity finance into the company. Professor Gordon McVie, senior consultant at the European Institute of Oncology, has been appointed chairman of the group, and Professor Karol Sikora has agreed to become chief medical adviser to the company, alongside a range of renowned cancer and healthcare experts. Ashya, with his parents Brett and Naghmeh. The Kings defiantly fled to Spain in a bid to get Ashya to the Proton Therapy Centre in Prague and protect him from the devastating side effects of NHS treatment. Professor McVie said: 'This is an exciting and important development of the provision of cancer treatment in the UK. As things stand, patients who benefit from this treatment have to go abroad for treatment, often at great expense to the NHS. 'The creation of these centres will go a long way to ensuring the very best of treatment is available in the UK.' While Sir Chris added: 'We are delighted that the UK's first centre will be based in Cardiff and Wales Life Sciences Investment Fund is proud to support this breakthrough. While conventional radiotherapy uses high energy beams of radiation to destroy cancerous cells, often damaging surrounding tissue, proton beam therapy aims radiation directly at the tumour. Because it is so highly targeted it means it can avoid healthy tissue, particularly tissues and organs behind the tumour. . While radiotherapy can lead to side effects such as nausea and can sometimes disrupt how some organs function, proton beam therapy has a lower risk of side effects. . This means it is effective for treating cancer that affects critical areas, such as brain cancer. However, Cancer Research UK estimates that only one in 100 people would be suitable for proton beam therapy and there are also concerns that the long-term impact of the nascent procedure is not yet known. . The only proton beam facility currently in operation is at the Clatterbridge Centre for Cancer NHS Foundation Trust in the Wirral, Merseyside, which delivers 'low energy' therapy for rare cancers around the eye. The NHS currently pays for those deemed appropriate for proton beam therapy to go to the United States for treatment. They must be assessed by a panel who may decide patients are not suitable if there is unlikely to be a clinical benefit from the treatment. . More than 400 patients have been sent abroad since 2008 - most of these children - at an average cost of \u00a3100,000 per patient. 'There are more than 150,000 people treated for cancer each year in the UK and the demand for treatment is growing. 'It is anticipated that NHS demand for proton beam therapy abroad will reach 1,500 patients by 2017. Proton Partners will be able to play a leading part in helping meet demand in the UK as of next year.' In addition to state of the art Proton Partners' treatment services, the Cardiff centre will provide conventional radiotherapy, chemotherapy and supportive care. Proton beam therapy is a highly-targeted type of radiotherapy that can treat hard-to-reach cancers, such as spinal tumours, with a lower risk of damaging the surrounding tissue and causing side effects. The Government has announced that it is to create two NHS proton beam therapy units which will open in 2018. The Kings faced every parent's worst nightmare when their young son was diagnosed with an aggressive brain tumour after suffering a series of mystery symptoms. But the family's own research into his condition led them to question the need for normal NHS radiotherapy - which would risk massive damage to healthy brain tissue and lead to lifelong disabilities. And despite threats to revoke their parental rights unless they went along with the therapy, the Kings defiantly fled to Spain in a bid to get Ashya to the Proton Therapy Centre in Prague and protect him from the devastating side effects of NHS treatment. They were arrested by European authorities and banned from seeing their sick son, with a High Court judge only approving the move to Prague after they had been released. When he finally arrived at the centre in September last year, Ashya was so sick he was unable to move and had to be fed by tubes. But in October, he was pictured smiling and waving to cameras, thrilled at the prospect of returning to the family holiday home in Malaga, Spain, and finishing his treatment there with his parents and older brother Naveed. Since then, he has continued to make encouraging progress and is enjoying a more normal life. However, despite the treatment and his recovery, Ashya's parents say they fear their children will be taken into care if", "hypo": ["Three centres in the UK in Cardiff, London and Northumberland, are set to open offering proton beam therapy.", "Announcement comes just weeks after parents of Ashya King told of how he was given the 'all-clear' after receiving proton beam therapy at a centre in Prague.", "Three centres in the UK in Cardiff, London and Northumberland, are set to open offering proton beam therapy.

Steven Allison, 37, formerly of Idle near Bradford, West Yorkshire, had been uploading pictures of himself looking tanned and happy as he enjoyed his freedom in his new life Down Under. But he was unaware the net was closing in as British police teamed up with colleagues in Australia and Interpol to locate Allison, who was living in the country's capital, Canberra. Steven Allison (left) was uploading pictures of himself in Australia to Facebook and writing posts about his former life in Yorkshire (right) despite being on the running from the law. Allison had already been on the run for a year when he was given a 30 month jail sentence for sexually assaulting two women after failing to turn up at Bradford Crown Court in February last year. He was supposed to be lying low in Sydney, where he found work as a labourer and handyman, but couldn't resist showing off his new life to his 739 Facebook friends. The sex attacker, who goes by 'Stig' on Facebook, posted pictures of his former life in Yorkshire and boasted about his carefree bachelor lifestyle, saying he wanted to meet women. Allison even joked about days being drunk in his hometown, including posts such as 'fooocking leathered that day,, for a change haha [sic]'. He also posted pictures of himself in his t-shirt on a building site with his arms raised in a mocking salute to Facebook friends, many of whom had no idea about his criminal past. . The assaults happened in June 2013 when Allison had been out drinking with a friend in Yeadon, Leeds, where he approached two women who rejected his advances. . Allison would not take no for an answer and indecently assaulted one of his victims as she left the pub in disgust. He had been laying low in Sydney (pictured) before moving to Canberra, where authorities closed in on him. When her friend threw a drink over him the rugby fan snapped and punched both girls to the ground. A West Yorkshire force spokesman said Allison had been charged with two sexual assaults but failed to appear in court. He added: 'Enquiries made by Bradford District's Public Protection Unit and Interpol traced him to Australia, where he had been working on construction sites. 'He was located in January this year and subsequently held in a detention centre, while arrangements were made for him to be returned to the UK.' While being held, Allison made one last bid for freedom by feigning an arm injury so he could attempt to escape while being taken for medical treatment. But his plan failed and he was brought back to the UK yesterday in handcuffs and flanked by three security guards from Australia. Det Insp Ben McDonald, of the Bradford District Safeguarding Unit, said: 'It was clear that Allison felt he could cheat justice by fleeing the country and escaping to Australia. 'He fled to the other side of the world to escape justice. However, the police will always pursue those wanted for serious crimes such as this, regardless of where they are in the world.' He is expected to appear in court before being transferred to prison. .", "hypo": ["Steven Allison, 37, had been on the run from the law for a year.

The 39-year-old is returning from a self-imposed break from golf to recover from injuries and a dip in form. Woods was given a warm welcome by the crowd and stopped to sign several autographs at Augusta. Woods has not won a major since the 2008 US Open and the last of his four Masters wins was a decade ago, with the 39-year-old only confirming on Friday that he would compete at Augusta. However, after showing no sign of the chipping 'yips' which blighted his performance in Phoenix on the range, Woods produced some vintage shots as he completed the front nine alongside long-time friend Mark O'Meara before playing the 10th and 18th alone. 'I felt good. It was nice to get out here,' said Woods, who was two under after four holes despite a wayward drive on the first and three-putting the par-five second for a par. 'Chipping is fine. I wanted to test out some wedges out here. That was why I was chipping a little bit more. It came down to a couple of different bounce settings because it's different from Florida. We figured the right one out. 'It's been a process. But I'm on the good side now. It's progression. I felt like I had to get my game into a spot where I could compete to win a golf tournament and it's finally there.' . Woods has not won a major since the US Open in 2008 and will be looking to get back to his best. Woods stopped to chat to Europe's Ryder Cup captain Darren Clarke (right) at Augusta on Monday. O'Meara, who won the Masters and Open in 1998, said: 'The thing about the kid is that you can never underestimate Tiger Woods. I'm a huge fan, a friend and I care about him. 'It was good to be out there with him. I saw some good signs. His pitching looks a lot better. 'There's a lot of pressure on him but there is no reason why he should not have a good week this week. 'There are not many people that have played the game of golf like he has. The game of golf is better because of Tiger Woods. 'He is in a good place and I think he is fired up about it. He will be nervous on Thursday but I think he will be fine. He hit a couple of shots that were a little off but a lot of quality shots.' Earlier in the day, US Open champion Martin Kaymer said he still felt Woods was 'the man,' but added: 'Who really knows what is going on in his head? . Woods looked confident and managed to pull off some impressive drives in front of the crowd. Woods hits a chip shot on to the green during the practice session ahead of the Masters 2015. Woods smiles during the practice round prior to the tee off of the 2015 Masters on Thursday. 'I hope he's happy. I hope he's fine. I hope he will play well this week. But what would bother me a lot is all the speculation. You don't have a choice; you will read about it somewhere. You will hear about it because you socialise with people. 'So mentally it must be quite exhausting and we know how important the mental part is in golf. It's difficult and some things I don't find very fair. You know, you should just let him be. Let him play golf, what he likes to do. 'Sometimes I look at it and find it quite sad how people treat the whole subject. It shouldn't be like this in my opinion. But that's how it is unfortunately. That is how a lot of people make their money and some athletes, they suffer because of that. 'Hopefully he's strong enough, he has people to talk to, and he finds a way to compete as good as he can. Because we all know when he's around, somehow it does make us play better, as well. 'I never experienced someone who played better than him. In my era, I never played with Seve (Ballesteros) and I never played with Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus, those guys. So for me, what I have seen and what I have experienced, he's the man.' .", "hypo": ["Tiger Woods has not won a major tournament since the 2008 US Open.

Moors murderer Ian Brady, pictured (left) from Ashworth psychiatric hospital and (right) in a court sketch in 2013, has revealed that he is a Ukip supporter and thinks David Dimbleby is an 'establishment dumpling' in a series of letters. In a series of rambling letters, he wrote:. It comes four months after Brady - who has to use a Zimmer frame to move around - wrote a letter to a Channel 5 News correspondent, in which he expressed no remorse for his killings. Instead he complained he is 'bedridden and worsening' after breaking his hip and arm in fall a year ago. Brady (left) was jailed for life in 1966 after torturing and killing five children with his then-girlfriend Myra Hindley (right) The victims were lured to their deaths, sexually tortured then buried on Saddleworth Moor above Manchester. Above, police search the area for the bodies. In the December letter he wrote: 'This cell block is described as a \"discharge ward\"; I've been sitting here 30 years... and there's no turnaround of inmates unless in a coffin.' Brady murdered five children between 1963 and 1965 along with accomplice Hindley, who died aged 60 in 2002. The victims were lured to their deaths, sexually tortured then buried on Saddleworth Moor above Manchester. . Pauline Reade, 16, disappeared on her way to a disco on July 12, 1963, and John Kilbride, 12, was snatched in November the same year. . Keith Bennett was taken on June 16, 1964, after he left home to visit his grandmother. . Lesley Ann Downey, 10, was lured away from a funfair on Boxing Day, 1964, and Edward Evans, 17, was killed in October 1965. His letter reads:. Politicians of today? Compared to the only truly democratic and altruistic peoples\u2019 government ever elected, Labour 1945, the UK corrupt, greedmotivated (sic) political vermin of today, aren\u2019t worth even assassination, all being Tory clerks/lackeys. However, I hope that UKIP not only wipes out the Lib-Dems but also decimates the Tory and Labour vote, and that the SNP achieves the same in Scotland. In addition, I hope the IRA is reactivated, as promised for a united Ireland. [...] . The corporate controlled (including the BBC) lower middle class, collusive, servile media generate a false appearance if of democracy and free speech, in a now spineless population constantly asking, \"am I allowed to say (this and that)?\" (sic) Where the voters now have the choice between a coalition of public school millionaires or a refugee privileged German Jew. Absurdity! Incidentally, the Scottish dictionary definition of \"Cleg\" (sic) is, aptly, \"a course grey bloodsucking horsefly\". Cleg (sic), like his US lickspittle Blair, would form a coalition with literally anyone, just to retain his public image of secondhand power and pathetic grandiosity. As I stopped reading UK newspapers or relying on UK media, depending only on Aljezeers (sic) and Teletext, I know nothing of any EU decisions on UK prisoners possibly voting, and couldn\u2019t care less! Ironically in my half century of imprisonment, I discovered that most professional criminals are Tory voters! [...]. Yours faithfully, . IS Brady . Keith Bennett (left), 12, was snatched and murdered in 1964 and John Kilbride (right), also 12, was snatched in November the year before. Since being convicted Brady has hardly been seen. Above, a police convoy takes Brady to Liverpool Crown Court in 2000 for what was his first appearance in more than 30 years. Brady was given whole life sentences for the murders of John, Lesley Ann and Edward - but did not admit to killing Keith and Pauline until he was in prison. Keith's body has never been discovered. . Hindley was convicted of killing Lesley Ann and Edward, and shielding Brady after John's murder. She was jailed for life. Taxpayers have forked out more than \u00a314million on Brady since he was convicted nearly 50 years ago. He has racked up the costs by staging a 15-year hunger strike and a series of failed legal challenges - for which he has relied on legal aid. He lost his last appeal to be transferred to a 'ordinary' prison in June 2013. .", "hypo": ["Ian Brady, 77, wrote the letters from his bed at Ashworth psychiatric hospital.

As the two men small-talked in Zurich, Simeone is understood to have asked Ancelotti how life was in Madrid and his answer demonstrated perfectly the dynamic between the two men. He said he was happy in the city and keen to stay, but that life would be a lot easier if Simeone were not on the other side of town managing Atletico Madrid. Having already lost the Spanish Super Cup to Simeone at the start of the season, and the first league meeting between the two teams, since the FIFA gala Ancelotti has been knocked out of the Copa del Rey by his nemesis and beaten 4-0 in the league. The pressure is on Carlo Ancelotti and Real Madrid when Atletico Madrid visit the Bernabeu on Sunday. Ancelotti reportedly told Diego Simeone that life in Madrid would be a lot easier if Atletico weren't around. Simeone (left) and Ancelotti (right) were runners-up behind Joachim Low at the Ballon d'Or in January. \u2018We don\u2019t need to beat them, we just need to go through\u2019 was how he approached the first leg of the Champions League quarter-final. That would have been fine had Real marked-up a high-scoring draw in the Calderon but the 0-0 somehow scraped by Atletico Madrid last Tuesday means that now a draw will not send Real Madrid through. Carlo needs to beat Diego \u2013 or else it\u2019s either elimination or penalties. Ancelotti\u2019s overall record against Simeone is poor with just three wins in 12 games. He has been beaten twice by his team in the league this season, losing one and drawing one in the domestic competition last season. He did win both legs of a Copa del Rey tie last season but this season Atletico got their cup revenge with an away draw and a home win to knock Real out. Atletico also won the Spanish Super Cup in August. The overall record is 12 played, three won, four drawn and five lost. The games are tight, usually low scoring and uncomfortably physical for Real who, Sergio Ramos and Pepe aside, are short of players who have quite the same appetite for a battle. Ancelotti may well pick both on Wednesday night, and a third centre back in Rafael Varane as he looks to match the visitors for force. If all three are picked Pepe would step into a midfield enforcer\u2019s role that he has not occupied since the days of Jose Mourinho. Real Madrid have struggled against Atletico in recent years and were beaten 4-0 in La Liga in February. The headlines from Spanish publications AS and Marca on Wednesday focused on the huge derby game. The Champions League quarter-final first leg finished 0-0 after a physical game at the Vicente Calderon. There are seven players who a booking away from missing the first leg of the semi-final and German midfielder Toni Kroos, who is among them, has already lit the blue touch paper suggesting Atletico Madrid\u2019s players are experts in pressuring the referee. The question of what will happen to Ancelotti if he loses has already been extensively debated in Madrid. It wouldn\u2019t necessarily be the end of him but he would certainly have to overhaul Barcelona\u2019s two point advantage in the league \u2013 winning nothing would be grounds for automatic dismissal regardless of the Champions League he delivered last season. At times this season his team has looked like surpassing the exploits of last year\u2019s campaign \u2013 the run of 22 straight wins that also saw them crowned World Club champions in December in Malaysia was the stuff of future legend but the season collapsed in February and the bouquets for the Italian turned into brickbats overnight. Toni Kroos is a yellow card away from European suspension while Ancelotti has several players missing. The Italian coach watches his players, including Cristiano Ronaldo (centre) train in Madrid on Monday. Injuries played their part in the massive downturn. Sergio Ramos and Pepe were missing from defence and Luka Modric and James Rodriguez from midfield. Supporters bemoaned the fact that Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema should still have been able to carry the team to victories but that view did a huge disservice to the way Modric controls games, Rodriguez loads the bullets for the front three to fire, and Pepe and Ramos' pace enables the team to play ten yards higher up the pitch than when they are not available. Just when it seemed Real would be at full-strength for the run-in Modric has gone down with knee ligament trouble likely to rule him out for six weeks and Benzema, Bale and Marcelo are also all missing on Wednesday night. Ancelotti resisted the opportunity to get his excuses in early on Tuesday when he said he had the \u2018best squad in the world\u2019. He will hope that message of confidence inspires his players at the Bernabeu. And of course in among all the bad omens there is one exceptionally positive precedent: in Lisbon last May, Madrid beat Atletico Madrid 4-1 and lifted the European Cup. If Ancelotti and Real were to lose on Wednesday night then only La Liga glory would be enough to save his job. Cristiano Ronaldo struck in the Champions League final in a rare 4-1 victory for Real against their city rivals. .", "hypo": ["Carlo Ancelotti and Diego Simeone were runners-up at the Ballon d'Or.

The president and former actor went off-script during a peace summit in Geneva in the 1980s to ask the Soviet leader for his support in the event of an invasion from extra terrestrial life. Reagan repeated the warning when he spoke to a group of students, and his subsequent speeches were examined by his advisers to remove any mention of aliens in them. Ronald Reagan (right) met Mikhail Gorbachev (left) for the first time at a peace summit in Geneva, Switzerland in 1985 and asked for his support in the event of an alien invasion. The warning was revealed in a book about UFOs by Dr David Clarke, which examines the extent to which Americans believed in stories about aliens. He suggests his words may show that Reagan, who was inspired by science fiction movies, saw there could have been a threat from aliens. . The President is believed to have become an avid science fiction fan while working in Hollywood as a B movie actor and was said to be addicted to films like The Day the Earth Stood Still and Close Encounters. He confessed his favourite story was 'the invasion from outer space that prompts earthlings to put aside nationalistic quarrels and band together to fight the alien invader'. . Reagan even arranged a private screening of Stephen Spielberg's Close Encounters of the Third Kind at the Whitehouse in 1982 for top judges, astronauts and other VIPs. In 1985 he went a step further and directly addressed Gorbachev at a summit to ask for his support in the event aliens were to invade. . Ronald Reagan asked Mikhail Gorbachev for support fighting a future alien invasion at a peace summit. 'He surprised Gorby by saying he was sure the two superpowers would co-operate if Earth was threatened by alien invasion,' Dr Clarke said. 'Taken aback, the Soviet leader politely changed the subject.' . Reagan apparently then told his inner circle he felt he had 'scored a point' over his counterpart. . Deputy national security adviser Colin Powell was said to be horrified by the mention of aliens at the meeting. He then found Reagan repeated the story to a group of Maryland high school students after his return to the US in 1985. Powell's solution was to go through the President's public speeches deleting 'interplanetary references' right until Reagan's final months in office. Dr Clarke said that at any mention of an alien invasion Powell would roll his eyes and say 'Here come the Little Green Men again.' The book suggests Reagan was secretly appalled by nuclear weapons and his approach to Gorbachev may have been inspired by the 1951 movie, The Day the Earth Stood Still. In the film, an interplanetary peace-keeping force lands on earth using an invincible giant robot to force the warring nuclear powers to put aside their differences. Dr Clarke said: 'For a generation that lived in fear of the bomb, this message of salvation from the stars, delivered by technological angels, was a welcome alternative to the Cold War stalemate. 'Ronald Reagan was a born-again Christian and saw no contradiction between his faith and a belief in aliens.' Mikhail Gorbachev, pictured in Germany in November 2014, was said to be shocked by Reagan's request . Dr David Clarke, who wrote How UFOs Conquered The World, said Reagan appeared to believe in aliens . Dr Clarke said the President may also have been convinced he was speaking for the American public because of a poll released, shortly after Close Encounters hit film screens. According to a Gallup poll, 57 per cent of Americans believed that UFOs were real, compared to 27 per cent of the British population. Seven per cent claimed to have actually seen one. Dr Clarke added: 'Ronald Reagan is remembered for his warnings about the danger posed by the \"evil empire\" by which he meant the Soviet Union. The former US President was said to be obsessed with science fiction films like Close Encounters . 'But he was also obsessed with science fiction movies - in particular The Day the Earth Stood Still - and his comments to Gorbachev at the 1985 summit in Geneva imply that he might have believed the real threat came not from behind the Iron Curtain but from hostile extra-terrestrials. 'He wasn't the first world leader to suggest that the nations of the Earth would only unite in the face of a common foe from outer space. 'In 1947, just a couple of months before the Roswell incident, the British foreign secretary Anthony Eden - who was to become Prime Minister in 1955 - said he feared the world would only be united when we \"find someone in Mars to get mad against.\"' . Dr Clarke's book, How UFOs Conquered The World, is due to be released next month. .", "hypo": ["Former American President asked Mikhail Gorbachev for his support in the event of an alien invasion.

A teenager set herself on fire after allegedly being raped by five men from her village in India. She is now recovering in Delhi\u2019s Safdarjung Hospital (pictured) She was allegedly gang-raped on Sunday when she went outside her house in Kosi Kalan, in Uttar Pradesh's Mathura district, to relieve herself (file image) On Tuesday she set herself on fire using kerosene, according to NDTV, to the shock of her brother, who doused her with water. He told the broadcaster: \u2018When I woke up, I saw her in flames... I poured water on her to put out the flames.\u2019. The girl was screaming for help, according to a neighbour. The accused men have been arrested. . There is a heightened sensitivity to the issue of sexual assault in India at the moment after officials last month banned India's Daughter, a documentary about the gang rape and murder of an Indian student in Delhi. Recent attacks in India have resulted in street protests with many calling for more protection for women. Officials said the documentary would cause further disorder if it was shown, following a number of protests and incidents of vigilante justice in the country. The documentary explained the brutal rape and murder of 23-year-old student Jyoti Singh, who was attacked on a bus when she returned home from the cinema. One of the six men convicted of the attack, bus driver Mukesh Singh, was interviewed in prison and told researchers that had Jyoti not fought back she would not have been killed. Her death led to protests throughout India and outraged the world. Last month an angry mob were seen on video footage beating a man to death in the street who was accused of raping and murdering an 11-year-old girl. Video footage has emerged of the brutal prolonged attack on the 18-year-old, which was watched by a jeering 1,000-strong crowd in Nagaland in eastern India. Ibo Cha was said to have been beaten for an hour before he died of his injuries. The footage was shot in September last year after the girl's body was found in woodland, enraging locals. But it only came to light after earlier this year alleged rapist Syed Sarif Khan was kidnapped from prison and dragged through the streets of the same area. He was then stripped naked and beaten to death. He was accused but not convicted of raping a 19-year-old female student multiple times. Later Nagaland Government said he was innocent. Jyoti Singh Pandey, a physiotherapy student, was gang raped as she travelled on a bus. The 23-year-old suffered in hospital for 13 days from her injuries before she died. . Vinay Sharma, 20, Akshay Thakur, 28, Pawan Gupta, 19, and Mukesh Singh, 26, were all sentenced to death for her rape. . Ram Singh, co-accused and widely considered the leader of the group, was found dead in his cell. . A minor also found guilty was sentenced to three years in a reformatory institution. Her death sparked angry protests in India and internationally about misogyny in the country. The attention forced judges to prioritise the case and the lawyer's association in Saket reportedly refused to defend the perpetrators. .

But Sharon and Mike Tierney have taken their mutual upkeep to a whole new level, believing that 'the couple that waxes together, stays together.' The Sydney-based duo set aside an evening once a month to tend to all their beauty maintenance needs. Sharon, 45, trims her 40-year-old husband's eyebrows, wax his nostrils and even grooms his pubic hair. Scroll down for video . High maintenance: Sydney couple Mike and Sharon Tierney set aside one evening per month for mutual grooming. You wax my back, I'll wax yours: Sharon trims her husband's eyebrows, waxes his nostrils and trims his pubic hairs, while he returns the favours with waxing, spray tans and eyelash tints. For his part, Mike has been well trained in the art of waxing, and waxes her underarms, legs, upper lip and chin, and can even perform a Brazilian wax. The British ex-pat can also tint eyelashes and give Sharon a spray tan. Sharon admits while some women are horrified about their man seeing their lady parts in all their hairy glory, she says there's no limitations to their marriage. 'He\u2019s seen everything, there\u2019s nothing I wouldn't not let him see,' she told Daily Mail Australia. Being a well-groomed gentleman can be a dangerous undertaking though. . Regime: While most couples may admit to assisting each other with squeezing the odd hard-to-reach pimple, but Sharon and Mike take it to a whole new level. Close cut: One hair incident involved Sharon attempting to give her husband a 'number one', and ended up cutting his scrotum . 'He says it\u2019s for neatness,' Sharon said of her husband's preference for a 'number one' in the pubic region, 'but I think it\u2019s to gain that precious \u201coptical inch\u201d.' One evening during their usual pluck, wax and clipping session, things got a little bit hairy. 'I thought we should stretch the optical illusion to its limits, so I removed the clipper guard to get the closest possible trim. We were coasting along brilliantly until we hit the scrotum and its soft, sagging, sensitive skin,' she said. The worst happened, and a poor, screaming Mike was left with a bleeding cut in the most sensitive of body parts. . 'I was just trying to make his penis look bigger,' said Sharon. 'Not that it\u2019s not big, but that\u2019s what men want isn\u2019t it?\u201d' . The trimmed twosome began their mutual grooming regime together 13 years ago. The couple met in London at a Pop Idol party when Sharon was on a holiday to the UK. Their fling turned into a relationship, with Sharon moving to London. During her time their, she struggled to find a decent waxing therapist. Upon returning to Australia, Sharon spent six months training in beauty therapy to open her own salon, and turned to her husband to play guinea pig. . Guinea pig: Mike was enlisted when Sharon was training to become a professional waxer and needed someone to practise on. Mike was enlisted to step in when she was training up her junior therapists. 'One of the girls said her boyfriend could do it but they broke up two days before and we needed a model and I told Mike we were desperate - and he agreed, Sharon told Daily Mail Australia. 'God love him, there he was butt naked in front of my blonde, 20 year old staff, he would do anything to support me.' In business: After struggling to find a decent wax while living in London, Sharon trained and opened her own salon upon returning to Australia. 'He's a good sport and just goes along with it - which is nice because he's English and very conservative - it shows he will do anything for me.' 'I get Mike to use a bit of both types of wax. Usually strip wax on your labia is too sensitive, so I use it around the edges and use a hot wax on intimate areas, such as Veet Naturals Warm Wax.' While the sliced scrotum wasn't severe enough to land Mike in the hospital, an ill-timed bout of appendicitis did spell embarrassment for the Englishman. 'It was only an hour after getting waxed he was rushed to hospital with emergency appendicitis,' said Sharon. 'A young female doctor said, \"I'm really sorry we have to check your testicles,\" and he was so embarrassed. From London to Oz: The couple met in the UK when Australian Sharon was there on holiday 13 years ago. Metro man: From clipping and trimming to waxing and tinting, men are more open to beauty maintenance than ever. 'She asked what I did for a living and I said - \"you\u2019re about to find out!\" She was in fits of laughter when I told her and poor Mike had all these doctors checking out his freshly waxed scrotum.' 'But in the end because all the hospital staff knew, everyone ended up taking brochures and we got a heap of new clients, so it turned it into a positive thing. Not to mention he quite enjoyed all the nurses saying \"oh you\u2019re the one with the Brazilian.\" ' . As for their ventures 'down under' together, Sharon has now written a tell-all book to give women guidance on what's normal down there and a expose on their hilarious adventures together, aptly titled 'The Vagina Buffet.' 'I think when you put your hand on someone\u2019s vagina it\u2019s like they get verbal diarrhoea, they want to get comfortable with you and tell you everything, it\u2019s unbelievable how much I've learned about people and the vagina.' .", "hypo": ["Sydney couple Mike and Sharon Tierney set aside one evening per month for mutual grooming.

The prospect of a Treble evaporated last Sunday, an afternoon Ronny Deila now describes as the worst of his career. \u2018I sat and stared at the walls,\u2019 said the Norwegian of the aftermath. Eight points clear of Aberdeen with five games left to play, however, his outlook is suddenly brighter. .

Scorers: Mackay-Steven 32, van Dijk 63 . Referee: Calum Murray . Attendance: 8, 908 . A fourth successive title looks to be a question of when and not if. It could even happen at Pittodrie on May 10, where van Dijk scored the most significant of his impressive 10-goal haul back in November. He was at it again last night, thrashing home his second 20-yard free-kick in as many games. Ever the perfectionist, his manager still wants more. \u2018Virgil has shown that ability also last season with his free-kicks. We can also see it in training, so he has to use it more. \u2018It became a very good night and we have put ourselves in a very good position. Eight points ahead with five games to go \u2014 and the goal difference as well. We just have to keep on performing and putting pressure on Aberdeen.\u2019. Last Sunday, van Dijk\u2019s early strike against Inverness was overtaken by events. Here, his thrashing effort past Dundee keeper Scott Bain earned Celtic the two-goal lead which ultimately repelled a late rally from the hosts. Jim McAlister\u2019s goal in the 87th minute was too little, too late. . Celtic's Gary Mackay-Steven (top) jumps over the challenge from Dundee's Willie Dyer (bottom) . Celtic striker Leigh Griffiths (right) goes close with an effort on goal against Dundee on Wednesday night. Celtic had claimed the lead in 32 minutes and, with painful predictability, it was laced with more refereeing controversy. It was fairly mild stuff in contrast with Sunday \u2014 and the irony of Celtic being the beneficiaries here will be lost on no one. This is a week when Scottish referees are destined to be hoist by their own petard. A week when every error, minor or major, will be punished to the maximum. The row over the Josh Meekings\u2019 hand-ball in the Scottish Cup semi-final defeat rumbles on but there will be no Parkhead postage stamps wasted this time. There will be no disputing the free-kick which teed up Gary Mackay-Steven\u2019s superbly struck opener. Paul Hartley may have other ideas. \u2018There were some decisions which I thought were quite bizarre,\u2019 said the Dundee manager. \u2018Referees are always under pressure but after what\u2019s happened the last few days, the scrutiny is always going to be on them.\u2019. It was Calum Murray\u2019s turn to be placed in football\u2019s equaivalent of a thumbscrew last night. A nondescript 32 minutes had passed without incident or urgency when a promising move by the visitors was interrupted by a barge on Mackay-Steven 30 yards from goal. It was a free-kick. Murray, rightly, played a good advantage before Leigh Griffiths immediately tripped over the ball and lost possession. The loss of the advantage was self-inflicted, yet to howls of derision from the home support, Murray pulled the play back for a Celtic free-kick. What came next was inevitable. Stuart Armstrong thumped a long ball towards the back post, van Dijk headed it firmly across the area and Mackay-Steven gathered on the edge of the box, rasping the ball into the top corner. Dundee\u2019s sense of injustice was merely compounded by a penalty claim before half-time when Jason Denayer bumped into Greg Stewart. It wasn\u2019t a penalty. Yet manager Hartley\u2019s pursuit of the officials reflected a broader frustration with his team. Afterwards he bemoaned the lack of \u2018cutting edge\u2019 from his team. He wasn\u2019t wrong. . Stuart Armstrong (right) is challenged and sent hurtling to the ground by Dundee's Ferry at Den's Park. Mackay-Steven fires Celtic into the lead with a cool finish following a snaking run through the Dundee box. Against a Parkhead side missing Adam Matthews and Stefan Johansen, the Dark Blues struggled to make inroads until the late McAlister strike. Celtic were little better in the opening stages. The opening goal from Mackay-Steven relaxed them markedly. Griffiths was unable to turn the ball back into the net from an acute angle after Emilio Izaguirre\u2019s cross was nodded across the face of the goal by James Forrest. The disputed free-kick changed things. With the lead they had cherished, Celtic seized the game by the scruff of the neck. They should have made it two in 43 minutes. Nir Bitton\u2019s scuffed, mishit shot from the edge of the area fell kindly at the feet of Forrest in an onside position. The winger had time and opportunity to drive it home, but hit an unconvincing effort at just the right height for Bain to pluck the ball out of the air. Denayer\u2019s clash with Stewart \u2014 a nondescript affair unworthy of a spot kick \u2014 provoked the ire and frustration of Hartley. Celtic had undeniably enjoyed a break from the referee for their first. There could be no real complaints over the free-kick which reaped their second in 63 minutes. James McPake clattered into Armstrong 20 yards from goal. It was the same proximity as last Sunday\u2019s opener at Hampden \u2014 and the same devastating result.

Tommy Thompson has agreed to go to prison rather than reveal details about the valuable haul he recovered from the SS Central America. In 1988 the 62-year-old led an excursion to the vessel, known as the Ship of Gold, which sank off the Carolina coast in 1857 laden with 21 tons of gold. Tommy Thompson, 62, left, and girlfriend Alison Antekeier, 42, have both admitted contempt of court in Columbus, Ohio. Gold bars taken from the SS Central America which sank during a hurricane in 1857. Around 400 people drowned in the 19th-Century shipwreck. Thompson, then an oceanic engineer at Battelle Memorial Institute in Columbus, and his crew brought up thousands of bars and coins, much of them later sold to a gold marketing group in 2000 for about $50 million. He was accused of cheating his 161 investors, who paid $12.7 million to find the ship, out of the proceeds. . In civil proceedings brought by a number of the backers they claimed the find was worth up to $260 million. Columbus attorney Rick Robol, who at one time defended Thompson's company, said there was no proof Thompson stole anything. . Thompson and his girlfriend, Alison Antekeier, 42, failed to appear in court in 2012 and abandoned their Florida mansion. . A man who had worked for the couple later discovered wads of cash hidden in the pipes and a book called How To Be Invisible at the property. Thompson and Antekeir were arrested in January after U.S. marshals tracked them down to the Boco Raton Hotel in Florida. They were said to have been staying there for more than a year and using fake names, according to U.S. marshals. 'Thompson was smart \u2014 perhaps one of the smartest fugitives ever sought by the U.S. Marshals, along with almost limitless resources and approximately a 10-year head start,' U.S. Marshal Michael Tobin said when the pair were found. . The couple, both wearing orange jumpsuits and chains, admitted contempt of court at the federal courthouse in Columbus, Ohio, after reaching a plea bargains. . 'This case started with willful disobedience of a judge's order to appear in court and ended when the U.S. Marshals Service got their man and woman,' prosecutors reportedly said, according to the Columbus Dispatch. An artists impression of the SS Central America sinking off the Carolina coast in 1857. Thompson is said to be facing no more than two years in custody after he agreed to hand over $435,380 in cash that was found with the couple, the newspaper reported. But under the deal he will not have to testify about the gold haul he discovered in the historic shipwreck. . Assistant U.S. Attorney Douglas Squires recommended Antekeier serve no prison time.

The Lowenbrau Keller, in Sydney's The Rocks, has released a social media and bus campaign featuring the slogan 'Wunderbra' underneath a photograph of a woman in a low-cut lederhosen holding a tray of beer steins. The same campaign also features an image of two women in a similar state of dress with the caption 'Make Mein A Dubbel', sparking outrage from Collective Shout, who claim the advertisements reinforces sexual objectification. . Scroll down for video . Campaign group Collective Shout has slammed Sydney restaurant Lowenbrau Keller for an advertising campaign they claim sexually objectifies women. The Lowenbrau Keller campaign is being used on both social media and public transport platforms. 'Through this advertising Lowenbrau reinforces sexist attitudes and invites patrons to view female staff as sexual objects, exposing them to sexual harassment,' Melinda Liszewski, spokesperson for grassroots campaign movement Collective Shout, told Daily Mail Australia. '[The company's slogan] \u201cLive it Large\u201d and \u201cWunderbra\u201d sends the message to an audience of all ages that women are to be valued for their body parts,' Ms Liszewski said. . Ms Liszewski said that the 'Make Mein A Dubbel' advertisement also suggests that the two women shown are 'part of the menu'. . Dan Hopkirk, Marketing Director for Urban Purveyor Groups who owns the Lowenbrau Keller, said that the advertisements were meant as 'fun play-on words' that people would be familiar with. '[The campaign was] designed as a portrayal of the typical Bavarian cultural experience enjoyed by millions during Oktoberfest in Munich every year, synonymous with this venue,' Mr Hopkirk said. 'The advertising slogans coupled with the imagery that has been used across the campaign, are popular anglicised German phrases which are fun play-on words,' he said. . 'The L\u00f6wenbr\u00e4u Keller campaign aims to embody the traditions of Oktoberfest which is about a celebratory occasion and enjoyable time spent with friends.' Ms Liszewski said that the Lowenbrau Keller, along with other establishments which the Urban Purveyor Group owns, including the Bavarian Bier Cafe, has a history of creating sexist and objectifying advertisements. 'A number of Lowenbrau advertisements make a direct comparison between the serving size of food and beverages and the size of women\u2019s breasts,' she said. . Ms Liszewski said that the advertisement also suggests that the two women shown are 'part of the menu' This images was tweeted from the restaurant's official Twitter account and posted to their Facebook page with the caption 'Is anybody suddenly thirsty?' The advertisements have garnered criticism from social media users who expressed their outrage over the allegedly objectifying images. 'This is explicitly spelt out via an ad on social media \u201cBigger is better - don\u2019t you agree? We\u2019ve got big biers, big meals and big\u2026fun. #beer\u201d and reinforced by outdoor advertisements.' The image, which shows a woman's chest next to steins of beer, was tweeted from the restaurant's official Twitter account, and was also posted to their Facebook page with the caption 'Is anyone else suddenly thirsty for a bier?'. The advertisements have garnered criticism from social media users who expressed their outrage over the allegedly objectifying images. . 'Wie Sexistisch. If that is the attitude you wish have about your restaurant, then I wont be visiting it again! Guten Tag!' posted one social media user after the image was posted onto the Lowenbrau Keller Facebook page. One Twitter user uploaded a photo of the current 'Wunderbra' advertisement after spotting it on the back of a bus. . 'I'm glad these advertisers drew the line before they went tasteless,' the social media user joked. According the Advertising Standards Board code, advertisers are prohibited from presenting men or women in a way that is sexually 'exploitative and degrading'. . However, in 2007 the Lowenbrau Keller was reported to the Board for a previous campaign which showed a man dressed in traditional Bavarian clothing staring down the front of a woman in a low-cut lederhosen who is holding two steins of beer. The Board dismissed the complaint due to the 'ambiguity' of the claim that the man was shown to be staring at the woman's breasts, but ruled that the advertisement emphasised the woman's breasts and 'this did objectify the woman'. . 'I'm glad these advertisers drew the line before they went tasteless,' a social media user joked when he posted this image to Twitter after spotting the ad on the back of a bus. 'Viewing these advertisements it is hard to believe it is 2015,' said Ms Liszewski. The Lowenbrau Keller responded to the claims and said that 'the last impression we want to give is that you can come to our restaurant and stare at our waitresses' breasts, and we have very strict house rules for anyone in our restaurant exhibitingoffensive behaviour.' . However, Ms Liszewski said that the active social media media presence the restaurant had allowed fans of the establishment to express sexually harassing comments. 'Comments posted by fans on social media demonstrate this - \u201cBig t*ts\u201d \u2026. \u201cvery nice jugs\u201d \u2026 \u201cthis is what you will see on Saturday night big ass \u201cbeers\u201d can\u2019t wait\",' she said. . In 2013, the Urban Purveyor Group released an ad for Oktoberfest, which is held in both the Lowenbrau Keller and the Bavarian Bier Cafe each year. The clip depicts 'Bavarian beauties training for Oktoberfest', clad in short shorts and crop tops as they run along the beach and the camera pans up and down the women's bodies. . 'Viewing these advertisements it is hard to believe it is 2015. There is a growing awareness in the community that sexual objectification and sexist attitudes underpin the epidemic of violence against women in Australia,' Ms Liszewski said. . Ms Liszewski said that the active social media media presence the restaurant had allowed fans of the establishment to express sexually harassing comments. The Advertising Standards Board advised that the Bavarian Bier Cafe removed the above ad after it was slammed for sexually objectifying women and comparing them to pieces of meat.

But a police poster advising women to stick together on a night out provoked anger yesterday, as campaigners claimed it suggested victims were responsible for sex attacks. Sussex Police was accused of \u2018victim-blaming\u2019 in its campaign, which urges women not to leave their friends alone or let them wander off with strangers. Women\u2019s rights groups said rapists were to blame for sex attacks, not their victims. Anti-rape campaigners have criticised the message in this Sussex Police poster arguing it implies that victims are to blame for getting raped. But the poster won praise from supporters who said it was \u2018blindingly obvious\u2019 that it was not blaming women, and that it simply offered \u2018sensible advice\u2019. It features a picture of two smiling young women posing for a selfie, with the text: \u2018Which one of your mates is most vulnerable on a night out? The one you leave behind.\u2019 It goes on: \u2018Many sexual assaults could be prevented. Stick together and don\u2019t let your friend leave with a stranger or go off on their own.\u2019. But anti-rape campaigners said police should target potential attackers instead, and that the poster sent a message that women needed a constant chaperone. Sarah Green, acting director of the End Violence Against Women Coalition, said she found the advice \u2018infuriating\u2019. . She added: \u2018We need to get beyond police campaigns giving instructions to women on how to behave to be safe. We need to talk to those who may perpetrate rape and deter them.\u2019. Campaign: The posters are due to be put up in pub and club toilets as well as bus stops in Brighton (pictured) as well as other areas of Sussex. A pair of police officers watch on as University students gather on the street outside a bar in Brighton. Fabia Bates, of the Survivors\u2019 Network, said: \u2018Sussex Police has made great strides to encourage people to report sexual violence and there is the possibility this could damage people\u2019s confidence. \u2018We are here to support anyone who has been the victim and will not judge anyone \u2013 it is never the victim\u2019s fault.\u2019. Chief Inspector Katy Woolford said the police had a responsibility to advise potential victims on how to minimise risks. But David Davies, a former special constable who is running for re-election as Tory MP for Monmouth, said he thought the poster offered \u2018common sense advice\u2019, adding: \u2018I don\u2019t think it\u2019s blaming victims ... it\u2019s like telling people to lock car doors. I would say the same to young men, not to leave their mates behind in what could be a dangerous area because they could get robbed or sexually assaulted. \u2018It\u2019s disappointing that some groups don\u2019t realise police are trying to help prevent problems. \u2018No one\u2019s suggesting the attacker doesn\u2019t bear responsibility, the police are simply trying to make sure people are aware of danger and try to avoid it. It\u2019s blindingly obvious.\u2019 Clarence Mitchell, who is standing as the Tory candidate in Brighton Pavilion, agreed. \u2018I\u2019m quite sure that Sussex Police in no way intended to imply that women are somehow responsible for any attack,\u2019 he said. \u2018This is an entirely sensible campaign.\u2019. Sussex Police said the posters would be put up at bus stops and in pub and nightclub toilets. Chief Inspector Katy Woolford said: \u2018Rape is never a victim\u2019s fault, but as with all crimes we can reduce the number of victims in several ways. \u2018It is vital to be aware of vulnerability so that steps can be taken to guard against it.\u2019. In 2012 West Mercia Police were forced to apologise for posters for its Safe Night Out initiative suggesting rape victims were to blame if they were drunk. Manchester Police were praised by anti-rape groups for their 2014 Christmas anti-rape campaign which carried the strapline: 'Drinking is not a Crime.

But shoppers at London's Westfield Stratford City shopping centre looked more than a little surprised to discover a chocolate sculpture of Benedict Cumberbatch in their midst. One lady was spotted cautiously approaching the edible artwork before quickly backing off, while another couldn't quite hide their smile of surprise. Scroll down for video . Finishing touches: The sculpture is readied for its big unveiling at Westfield Stratford City shopping centre. Oh dear: Reaction to the sculpture was mixed, with some shoppers bursting into laughter. Even less impressed was the shopper who stood stony-faced in front of the creation for several moments, while another burst into laughter as soon as she spotted it. It did, however, prove an immediate hit with a pair of police sniffer dogs who wagged their tails as they gave it a thorough sniffing down. . The artwork, which has been given pride of place in the shopping mall's atrium, was commissioned by UKTV to mark celebrate its screening of the third series of Sherlock. It took a crew of eight people to complete the sculpture, which took over 250 man hours to create and weighs 40kg . Does it look like me? Benedict Cumberbatch strikes a pose with James Corden during an Oscars party. Mixed reaction: A pair of police sniffer dogs loved the sculpture but shoppers looked baffled. Hilarious: A lady bursts into laughter after spotting the 6ft homage to Mr Cumberbatch. Not amused: A shopper looks thoroughly unimpressed as she contemplates the artwork. Luckily for Cumberbatch, who usually enjoys a considerably more complimentary response to projects he's involved in, the piece will only be in residence temporarily. The 38-year-old actor, who is currently expecting his first child with wife Sophie Hunter, 37, isn't the only famous face to have found himself the subject of an edible artwork. . In the run up to the release of 50 Shades of Grey, bakers created not one but two 6ft gateaux paying homage to Jamie Dornan. One depicted the actor in the grey suit beloved of his 50 Shades character Christian Grey, while the other showed him topless and came complete with an edible six-pack. Award-winning: Both Jennifer Lawrence and her cake alter-ego have won awards. Homage: The cake, which triumphed at a show last November, was inspired by the Hunger Games . Actress Jennifer Lawrence has also been immortalised in cake, with baker Lara Clarke creating a sweet treat designed to resemble the 24-year-old's Hunger Games alter-ego, Katniss Everdeen. The confection, which was baked ahead of the release of Mockingjay Part One in November, met with the approval of Lawrence herself, who, when asked about it, said Ms Clarke was 'incredibly talented'. Other A-listers to get the culinary treatment include Kevin Bacon, whose likeness was made from bacon, and Taylor Swift who featured on a cake. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were turned into a tasty-looking pizza, while President Barack Obama had his likeness sculpted from butter.

He likes to make jokes of me! . I remember in Moscow, at the last World Championships, when I was competing in the 200m when most people saw me as a 100m runner, he killed me in the warmup. . \u2018What are you doing?\u2019 he asked me. \u2018This is for the 200m runners \u2013 the 100m was a few days ago. You missed it.\u2019 I told him I was doing the 200m. \u2018Why? he asked again. I said I wanted to try it. He was winding me up. It was helping me relax, actually. It was very nice. Adam Gemili says Usain Bolt is a joker on the circuit and gives him great advice. The young British athlete says he is nowhere near Bolt's standard at the moment but it could be his time soon. Gemili has announced his participation in the Sainsbury's Anniversary Games this summer. It obviously worked, as I then ran sub-20 and he was praising me a lot and saying great things about me. . Bolt gave me some great advice to really enjoy athletics and have fun with it. He told me to have patience with it, make sure you keep enjoying it and you will get serious when you get a bit older and start to take it more seriously but don\u2019t put pressure on yourself to perform. No matter whatever anyone says or writes, make sure you\u2019re always having a good time. He\u2019s good like that. I can take that into this year. I like to think I always have a great time when I go to compete. I always give a big smile before races because you never get bored of that feeling; people cheering for you and making you feel like \u2018wow\u2019 all this training you\u2019ve done in the winter and throwing up on the track, all the hard slog is worth it. It\u2019s a brilliant feeling. Hopefully I can get a bit more serious, now that I\u2019ve just finished uni and I will start to get a bit more competitive with those guys. I don\u2019t think Bolt will be too worried about me at the moment, he\u2019s something special when he gets himself into shape and competing. I\u2019m very lucky to be around at this time when he\u2019s at his peak and running. . To be in the mix and be a part of these guys is nice. Bolt has been beaten before, which shows he is only human. After those guys have retired \u2014 sprinters like Tyson Gay and Justin Gatlin \u2014 it\u2019 s quite open for people to step in and take the mantle. Obviously the American and Jamaican sprinters have always been the top dogs, they are very powerful nations and hard guys to beat. In Britain and Europe we have some great young names coming through that can go on and push the performances up. I\u2019d like to think there is a chance for British sprinters to step into the void. We don\u2019t do the sport to come second or third. You do the sport to try to be the best. There will be a nice little gap opening and it will encourage a lot of people to step up their performance.
